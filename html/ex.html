<p>Our goal is to analyze the data and check how statistically significant such a statement. I downloaded Chicago’s crime data from the data portal: <a href="data.cityofchicago.org">data.cityofchicago.org</a>. This data contains reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department’s CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified. This data set has 6.3 million records. Each crime incident is categorized using one of the 35 primary crime types: NARCOTICS, THEFT, CRIMINAL TRESPASS, etc.. I frittered incidents of type HOMICIDE into a separate data set stored in <code>chi_homicide.rds</code>. Use <code>chi_crime.R</code> as a starging script for this problem.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Create a heat map for the homicide incidents. In which areas of the city you think houses are very affordable and in which they are not?</li>
<li>Create a map by plotting a dot for each of the homicide incidents. You will see similar picture as you saw with the heat plot. Look at the Hyde Park area in the south side Chicago. There is an "island" with no homicide incidents! Can you explain why? Hint: You might want open Google maps in your browser and zoom-in into this area.<br>
</li>
<li>Though president’t tweet is consistent with the data (<a href="goo.gl/VTPzFw">goo.gl/VTPzFw</a>), observing 52 homicides in January is not that unusual. Calculate the total number of homicides for each January. Use bootstrap to estimate 95% confidence interval for the mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> over January homicides. Is <span class="math inline">\(52\)</span> within the interval? Calculate confidence interval using <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-ratio. Do you think results from <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-ratio based calculations are reliable?<br>
</li>
<li>The history of 2001-present data is rather short. Chicago tribune provided total number of homicides for Chicago for each month of the 1957-2014 period. Use this data set and calculate the confidence interval for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> using bootstrap and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-ratio. Further answer the following questions: (i) Assuming monthly homicide rate follows Normal distribution, what is the probability that we observe 52 homicides or more? (ii) Do you think Normality assumption is valid? (iii) Assuming monthly homicide rate follows Poisson distribution, what is the probability that we observe 52 homicides or more?<br>
</li>
<li>There is a hypothesis that crime rates are related to temperatures (<a href="goo.gl/nPpHwv">goo.gl/nPpHwv</a>). Check this hypothesis using simple regression. Use linear model to regress homicide rate to the average maximum temperature. Does this relation appear significant? Perform residual diagnostics and find outliers and leverage points.<br>
</li>
<li>There is another hypothesis that rise in murder is related to the pullback in proactive policing that started in November of 2015 as a result of Laquan McDonald video release (<a href="https://goo.gl/7cm1CC" class="uri">https://goo.gl/7cm1CC</a>, <a href="https://goo.gl/WcH2uB" class="uri">https://goo.gl/WcH2uB</a>). I calculated total number of homicides for each day and split data into two parts: before and after video release. Using <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-ratio, check the hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>: the homicide rate did not change after video release.</li>

</ol>
<p>Solution:</p>
<p>First, we need to show the family of exponential distributions is closed under scaling. Let <span class="math inline">\(Z = aY\)</span> so that <span class="math display">\[P(Z \leq z) = P(Y \leq z/a) = 1 - \exp(-z/a)\]</span> Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(Z \sim Exp(1/a)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_{aY} = \frac{1}{a}\exp(-Y/a)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(W = X + \frac{1}{2}Y\)</span>. The density function of W is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}     f_W(W = w) &amp;=&amp; P(X+\frac{1}{2}Y = w) \\     &amp;=&amp; \int_0^w f_{X,\frac{1}{2}Y}(x, w-x)dx  \\     &amp;=&amp; \int_0^w f_X(x)f_{\frac{1}{2}Y}(w-x)dx \\     &amp;=&amp; \exp(-w)*\left(\frac{1}{2}\exp(-2w)\right)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}     E(W) &amp;=&amp; \int w*f_W(w)dw \\     &amp;=&amp; \frac{3}{2}\left(\int w*\frac{1}{3}\exp(-3w)dw\right) \\     &amp;=&amp; \frac{3}{2} = E(X) + \frac{1}{2}E(Y)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>By induction, the density function for <span class="math inline">\(W = X + \frac{1}{2} Y + \frac{1}{3} Z\)</span> should be <span class="math inline">\(\exp(-w)*\left(\frac{1}{2}\exp(-2w)\right)*\left(\frac{1}{3}\exp(-3w)\right)\)</span></p>

<p>Emily is taking Bayesian Analysis course. She believes she will get an A with probability 0.6, a B with probability 0.3, and a C or less with probability 0.1. At the end of semester she will get a car as a present form her (very) rich uncle depending on her class performance. For getting an A in the course Emily will get a car with probability 0.8, for B with probability 0.5, and for anything less than B, she will get a car with probability of 0.2. These are the probabilities if the market is bullish. If the market is bearish, the uncle is less likely to make expensive presents, and the above probabilities are 0.5, 0.3, and 0.1, respectively. The probabilities of bullish and bearish market are equal, 0.5 each. If Emily gets a car, she would travel to Redington Shores with probability 0.7, or stay on campus with probability 0.3. If she does not get a car, these two probabilities are 0.2 and 0.8, respectively. Independently, Emily may be a lucky winner of a sweepstake lottery for a free air ticket and vacation in hotel Sol at Redington Shores. The chance to win the sweepstake is 0.001, but if Emily wins, she will go to vacation with probability of 0.99, irrespective of what happened with the car.</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: You can solve this problem by any of the 3 ways: (ii) direct simulation using R, or Python, and (ii) exact calculation. Use just one of the two ways to solve it. The exact solution, although straightforward, may be quite messy.</p>

    "text": "Preface\nWelcome to the fascinating world of Bayesian learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning! This book is your guide to understanding these powerful tools and their applications, drawing from our experience teaching these exciting fields to two distinct audiences: business school students at the University of Chicago and engineers at George Mason University.\nThis unique blend of perspectives allows us to present complex concepts in a way that is accessible to data scientists, business professionals, and technical experts alike. Whether you’re a manager seeking to leverage AI in your organization or an engineer building the next generation of intelligent systems, this book has something for you.\nThe techniques discussed in this book are transformative and have a profound impact on automation. From self-driving cars to virtual assistants, they are already woven into daily life and will soon become even more pervasive across industries. Understanding them is essential for anyone who wants to stay ahead of the curve.\nAI’s ability to learn, adapt, and make decisions accelerates automation across industries. By analyzing vast amounts of data, AI algorithms identify patterns and trends that support informed decision-making, leading to better resource allocation, optimized processes, and improved outcomes. For example, AI-powered chatbots handle customer inquiries around the clock, offering personalized, efficient support that boosts satisfaction and loyalty. AI also creates entirely new business models, disrupting traditional markets and unlocking opportunities for innovation and growth. In addition, it is driving progress in areas such as personalized medicine and space exploration, with the potential to revolutionize these fields and improve our lives.\nThe term AI has morphed over time. Coined in 1956 by John McCarthy, it was first defined as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.” The field has since evolved, and so has the definition. Today, AI is a broad field encompassing various subfields, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. These terms are often used interchangeably, but they are not synonymous. Machine learning is a subfield of AI that focuses on algorithms that learn from data. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn complex patterns. Natural language processing is a subfield of AI that focuses on algorithms that can understand and generate human language.\nSince 1956, artificial intelligence has undergone significant transformations. Traditional AI focused on rule-based systems and Boolean logic with limited learning capabilities, which made them brittle in changing environments. In contrast, emerging AI is centered on modeling uncertainty, pattern matching, and deep learning—all data-driven approaches. These methods are more adaptable to complex, unstructured data, but they are also more data-dependent and can lack interpretability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOld AI\n\n\n\nIf rain outside, then take umbrella\nThis rule cannot be learned from data. It does not allow inference. Cannot say anything about rain outside if I see an umbrella.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew AI\n\n\n\nProbability of taking umbrella, given there is rain\nConditional probability rule can be learned from data. Allows for inference. We can calculate the probability of rain outside if we see an umbrella.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne example of the old AI vs the new AI comes from space exploration. As was famously said, the Kalman filter took us to the moon, and the deep learning took us back. The Appolo 11 code was written in 1969 and used the Kalman filter to navigate the lunar lander to the moon. The modern backwards landing of the rockets were enabled by deep learning. This re-use of rockets changed the economics of space exploration and made it more affordable.\nThis book is based on lecture notes from our courses, refined and expanded over years of teaching. We have incorporated valuable feedback from students at both the University of Chicago and George Mason University to create a comprehensive and engaging learning experience. The book is organized into three parts:\n\nPart 1: Bayesian Learning: This section covers the basics of probability and Bayesian inference.\nPart 2: Artificial Intelligence: It explores the core concepts of AI and focuses on pattern-matching techniques such as decision trees and generalized linear models.\nPart 3: Deep Learning: It delves into the world of deep learning, focusing on the architecture and training of deep neural networks. It covers convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and generative adversarial networks.\n\nThis work is inspired by the contributions of many great thinkers in AI and machine learning. We acknowledge the foundational work of pioneers such as Claude Shannon (information theory), John von Neumann (game theory and decision science), and Richard Bellman (dynamic programming and optimal control).\nThe evolution of AI can be summarized in three stages:\n\nSearch. Early search engines answered a single question with a ranked list of webpages. The PageRank algorithm, developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, used power iterations to rank these pages by relevance. Statistical tools like Kendall’s tau and Spearman’s rank correlation measured the similarity between the ranking and actual relevance.\nSuggestions. The first popular suggestion algorithm was developed by Netflix. It used collaborative filtering to recommend movies to users based on their viewing history and that of others, easing the burden of choice.\nSummaries. Current AI systems like ChatGPT and Perplexity excel at summarization and generalization. These large language models distill vast amounts of complex information into clear, coherent summaries that capture the essential points. They can generalize across different domains, connecting concepts and providing insights that might not be immediately obvious. This ability represents a significant leap from simple search and recommendation, as these AI agents can now act as intelligent intermediaries that understand context, identify patterns, and present information in the most useful ways.\n\nInitially, the interaction was a single question leading to a single answer. Then came suggestions, where the system anticipated user needs. Now, we have summaries, where AI agents interpret a request, formulate a plan, and execute it. This is the future of AI, where agents can work together to solve complex problems and provide valuable insights.\nBayesian learning is a powerful statistical framework based on the work of Thomas Bayes. It provides a probabilistic approach to reasoning and learning, allowing us to update our beliefs about the world as we gather new data. This makes it a natural fit for artificial intelligence, where we often need to deal with uncertainty and incomplete information. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a vast field that seeks to create intelligent agents capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks can include perception, reasoning, learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and language processing. AI has made significant progress in recent years, driven by advances in computing power, data availability, and algorithms. Deep learning is a subfield of AI that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data. These networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain and have the ability to learn complex patterns and relationships in data. Deep learning has achieved remarkable results in various tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and machine translation.\nThe worlds of business and engineering are increasingly intertwined, as AI becomes an essential tool in both domains. This book bridges the gap between these disciplines by demonstrating how Bayesian learning, AI, and deep learning can be applied to address real-world challenges in:\n\nBusiness: Market analysis, customer segmentation, risk management, and strategic decision-making.\nEngineering: Robotics, image recognition, natural language processing, and data-driven automation.\n\nFinance: Financial market modeling, risk management, and investment analysis.\n\nKey Features of This Book:\n\nAccessible explanations: We break down complex concepts into manageable chunks, using real-world examples and analogies to illustrate key principles.\nCase studies: We showcase practical applications of Bayesian learning, AI, and deep learning across diverse industries.\nHands-on exercises: We provide practical exercises and code examples to help you apply the concepts covered in the book to your own projects.\n\nJoining the AI Revolution:\nThe field of AI is rapidly evolving, and this book equips you with the knowledge and skills to stay ahead of the curve. Whether you’re looking to enhance your business acumen or advance your engineering career, understanding the power of Bayesian learning, AI, and deep learning is crucial.\nWe invite you to join us on this exciting journey and discover the transformative potential of these powerful tools!",

    "text": "AIQ, AGI and ASI\nWhen you open an Amazon page, there are many personal suggestions of goods to purchase. By analyzing previous product pages visited and purchases made by you and others who have bought similar products, Amazon uses AI and machine learning to predict what might interest you the next time you shop. When you apply for a loan online, you typically get an immediate answer after filling out an application. The information you provide, combined with your credit history pulled from a credit bureau, is used by a predictive model to determine with high confidence whether you are likely to default on the loan.\nWhat do Amazon, the finance industry, and a championship-winning baseball franchise have in common? They all use AI-driven methods to improve operations. Ability to automate tasks allows to scale operations and perform tasks that are too complex for humans to perform. AI-driven methods are becoming increasingly important in all industries.\nWhat are the key ingredients of AI-driven methods? At the heart of modern AI lie three fundamental pillars: deep learning architectures that extract hierarchical patterns from raw data by composing simple operations across many layers, Bayesian statistical frameworks that quantify uncertainty and update beliefs as evidence arrives, and high-performance computing infrastructure—particularly GPUs originally designed for gaming—that makes processing billion-parameter models and massive data sets feasible. Deep learning provides the representational power to capture complex relationships in high-dimensional data, enabling language models to represent subtle nuances of syntax and semantics while image recognition systems distinguish thousands of object categories by learning features from pixels to edges to shapes to objects. Bayesian methods complement this by providing a principled framework for reasoning under uncertainty, telling us how to interpret probabilistic predictions, incorporate prior knowledge, and update beliefs with new data—capabilities essential in scientific applications from drug discovery to climate modeling where quantifying uncertainty is as important as making predictions. The interplay between these three pillars creates a virtuous cycle: as computing power grows, we train larger models that capture increasingly sophisticated patterns while Bayesian frameworks quantify what they know and don’t know. Let’s start by trying to understand how deep learning fits within the broader landscape of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.\nData Science is a relatively new field that refers to sets of mathematical and statistical models, algorithms, and software that extract patterns from data sets. The algorithms are adaptations of applied mathematics techniques to specific computer architectures, and the software implements those algorithms.\nMachine learning (ML) applies AI models to design predictive rules for forecasting and what-if analysis. For example, companies use predictive models to optimize marketing budgets or forecast shipping demand. A machine-learning system is trained rather than explicitly programmed—it’s presented with many examples relevant to a task and finds statistical structure that allows it to automate that task. For instance, to automate tagging vacation pictures, you would present the system with examples of tagged photos, and it would learn rules for associating pictures with tags. Tools from statistics serve as a basis for many machine learning algorithms.\nArtificial Intelligence has been around for decades. The term AI was coined by the famous computer scientist John McCarthy in 1955. While initially connected to robotics, currently, AI is understood as a set of mathematical tools used to develop algorithms that perform tasks typically done by humans, such as driving a car or scheduling a doctor’s appointment. This set of mathematical tools includes probabilistic models, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning.\nDeep learning is a type of machine learning that performs a sequence of transformations (filters) on data. The output of each of those filters is called a factor in traditional statistical language and a hidden feature in machine learning. The word “deep” means that there is a large number of filters that process the data. The power of this approach comes from the hierarchical nature of the model.\nA major difference between modern and historical AI algorithms is that most recent AI approaches rely on learning patterns from data. For example, IBM’s Deep Blue, the chess-playing computer that famously defeated world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, was “hardcoded” with explicit rules and strategies designed by chess experts and IBM engineers. Deep Blue evaluated millions of chess positions per second using carefully programmed evaluation functions that assigned scores to board positions based on material advantage, piece positioning, king safety, and other strategic factors. These evaluation criteria were implemented as if-then statements and heuristics crafted by human experts rather than learned from data. On the other hand, the modern AlphaGo Zero algorithm did not use any human inputs and learned optimal strategies to play chess and other board games from large data sets generated from self-plays. Although handcrafted systems like Deep Blue performed well in some tasks, such as chess playing, they are hard to design for many complex applications, such as self-driving cars. Large data sets allow us to replace sets of rules designed by engineers with sets of rules learned automatically from data. Thus, learning algorithms, such as deep learning, are at the core of most modern AI systems.\nThe key concept behind many modern AI systems is pattern-recognition. A “pattern” is a prediction rule that maps an input to an expected output, and “learning a pattern” means fitting a good prediction rule to a data set. In AI, prediction rules are often referred to as “models.” The process of using data to find a good prediction rule is often called “training the model.” Mathematically, we can express this as learning a function \\(f\\) that maps inputs \\(x\\) to outputs \\(y\\), so that \\(y = f(x)\\). For instance, in large language model, \\(x\\) represents a question and \\(y\\) represents the answer. The learning process involves finding the function \\(f\\) that best captures the relationship between inputs and outputs by examining many examples of input-output pairs in a training dataset. Deep learning excels at discovering complex, nonlinear functions \\(f\\) when the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is too intricate to specify manually—such as the mapping from raw pixel values to semantic image content, or from question and answer to text.\nThe strong demand for AI talent has translated into substantial compensation premiums for students entering the field. According to the 2025 AI Talent Salary Report, AI professionals command a median salary of $160,000 annually, with a 28% premium over traditional tech roles. Entry-level AI engineers earn between $70,000 and $120,000, with specialized roles like computer vision engineers starting at $140,043. Importantly for students, specialization matters significantly: Large Language Model (LLM) engineers earn 25-40% more than general ML engineers, while AI Safety and Alignment specialists have seen 45% salary increases since 2023. The report emphasizes that companies hiring AI talent early pay 15-20% less than those waiting, suggesting that new graduates who enter the market quickly may benefit from competitive starting salaries as organizations rush to build AI capabilities.\nPeople, organizations, and markets interact in complex ways. AI facilitates organization and hence connects people to markets faster and more simply. Hence it creates economic value. Most of the recessions in the 19th century were a result of not being able to get goods to markets quickly enough, which led to banking crises. AI accelerates speed to market. It creates growth. The age of abundance is here.\nAndrej Karpathy’s talk, “Software Is Changing (Again),” explores how large language models (LLMs) are fundamentally transforming the way software is developed and used. He describes this new era as “Software 3.0,” where natural language becomes the primary programming interface and LLMs act as a new kind of computer. He compares it to the previous generations of software development approaches summarized in the table below.\nCurrently, LLMs are collaborative partners that can augment human abilities, democratizing software creation and allowing people without traditional programming backgrounds to build complex applications simply by describing what they want in plain English.\nPolson and Scott (2018) have predicted that human-machine interaction will be the next frontier of AI.\nHal Varian’s 2010 paper “Computer Mediated Transactions” Varian (2010) provides a foundational framework for understanding how computers can automate routine tasks and decision-making processes, reducing transaction costs and increasing efficiency. This includes automated pricing, inventory management, and customer service systems. He discusses systems that can coordinate between multiple parties by providing real-time information sharing and communication platforms. This enables more complex multi-party transactions and supply chain management.\nThis framework remains highly relevant for understanding modern AI and machine learning applications in business, as these technologies represent the next evolution of computer-mediated transactions, enabling even more sophisticated automation, coordination, and communication capabilities.",

And I am rooting for the machines.” - Claude Shannon\n\n\n“Let us suppose we have set up a machine with certain initial instruction tables, so constructed that these tables might on occasion, if good reason arose, modify those tables. One can imagine that after the machine had been operating for some time, the instructions would have altered out of all recognition, but nevertheless still be such that one would have to admit that the machine was still doing very worthwhile calculations. Possibly it might still be getting results of the type desired when the machine was first set up, but in a much more efficient manner. In such a case one would have to admit that the progress of the machine had not been foreseen when its original instructions were put in.

    "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs)\nThe adoption rate of AI technologies, particularly generative AI like ChatGPT, has shattered all previous records for technology adoption. While it took the internet 7 years to reach 100 million users, the telephone 75 years, and television 13 years, ChatGPT achieved this milestone in just 2 months after its launch in November 2022. This unprecedented speed of adoption reflects not just the accessibility of AI tools, but also their immediate utility across diverse user needs. Unlike previous innovations that required significant infrastructure changes or learning curves, AI chatbots could be accessed through simple web interfaces and provided immediate value for tasks ranging from writing assistance to problem-solving. The viral nature of AI adoption has been further accelerated by social media demonstrations and word-of-mouth sharing of impressive AI capabilities, creating a network effect that compounds the growth rate. This rapid adoption suggests that AI represents a fundamentally different type of technological shift - one that augments human capabilities rather than replacing existing systems entirely. The chart below illustrates the explosive growth potential of AI technologies.\n\n\n\nSource: https://johnnosta.medium.com/the-most-important-chart-in-100-years-1095915e1605\n\n\nThe algorithmic aspects of deep learning (the main building block of an AI system) have existed for decades. In 1956, Kolmogorov showed that any function can be represented as a superposition of univariate functions (this is exactly what deep learning does). In 1951, Robbins and Monro proposed stochastic approximation algorithms. Combined with regularization methods developed by Andrey Tikhonov in 1940s and 1950s, the stochastic approximation is the main technique for finding weights of a deep learning model today. The backpropagation algorithm for finding derivatives was first published and implemented by Werbos in 1974. In the mid-1980s, Schmidhuber studied many practical aspects of applying neural networks to real-life problems. Since the key ingredients of DL have been around for several decades, one could wonder why we observe a recent peak in popularity of those methods. Modern AI models are enabled by the old math and the new powerful GPU chips, which provide the parallel processing capabilities necessary to train deep neural networks on large datasets. The breakthrough in deep learning around 2012, including innovations like AlexNet for image recognition, would not have been possible without GPUs that could perform thousands of matrix multiplications simultaneously. Current AI models, including ChatGPT, Claude, and other large language models, continue to rely primarily on GPUs for both training and prediction. Modern AI training clusters consist of thousands of interconnected GPUs working together for weeks or months to process the enormous datasets required for today’s sophisticated models. While some companies have developed specialized AI chips like Google’s TPUs, GPUs remain the dominant platform for AI development due to their versatility, widespread availability, and established software ecosystems.\nThe gaming industry was one of the earliest drivers of GPU development, as game developers demanded increasingly sophisticated graphics rendering capabilities to create immersive virtual worlds with realistic lighting, textures, and physics simulations. Companies like NVIDIA and AMD invested heavily in parallel processing architectures optimized for the matrix operations required to render complex 3D scenes in real-time. The rise of cryptocurrency mining, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, created an unexpected second wave of GPU demand as miners discovered that graphics cards were far more efficient than traditional CPUs for the repetitive hash calculations required by proof-of-work algorithms. This mining boom drove massive investments in GPU manufacturing capacity and spurred innovations in memory bandwidth and energy efficiency. More recently, the explosion of AI-generated video content has created a third major demand driver, as video generation models require enormous computational power to process and synthesize high-resolution video frames. The convergence of these three use cases - gaming graphics, cryptocurrency mining, and AI video generation - has accelerated GPU development far beyond what any single application could have achieved alone, creating the powerful hardware infrastructure that now enables training of large language models and other AI applications.\nTable 1 illustrates the dramatic evolution of GPU performance over two decades, from early graphics cards to specialized AI accelerators. The data shows exponential growth in computational power: from the modest 0.23 TeraFLOPS of the 2006 GeForce 7900 GTX to the projected 100 PetaFLOPS (FP4) of the 2027 Rubin Ultra - representing a performance increase of over 400,000x. Here FP4 is a lower precision (4-bit) floating-point arithmetic that is used for AI workloads. It is an alternative to FP32 (32-bit) floating-point arithmetic that is used for general purpose computing. Memory capacity has similarly exploded from 0.5GB to a projected 1TB. Modern GPUs have evolved from simple graphics processors to sophisticated AI-optimized architectures featuring specialized tensor cores, mixed-precision arithmetic (FP8/FP4), and massive high-bandwidth memory systems. The transition from traditional FP32 floating-point operations to lower-precision AI workloads (FP8/FP4) has enabled unprecedented computational throughput measured in PetaFLOPS and ExaFLOPS scales, making current and future GPUs the primary engines driving the deep learning revolution and large language model training.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Evolution of Nvidia’s GPU performance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nArchitecture\nFP32 Peak (TeraFLOPS)\nFP8/FP4 Peak (Peta/ExaFLOPS)\nMemory (per GPU)\n\n\n\n\n2006\nGeForce 7900 GTX\n0.23\n\n0.5GB GDDR3\n\n\n2016\nGeForce GTX 1080\n8.9\n\n8GB GDDR5X\n\n\n2024\nRTX 4070 SUPER\n~32\n\n12GB GDDR6X\n\n\n2024\nBlackwell B200\n~45 (FP64)\n20 PFLOPS (FP4) / 1.4 ExaFLOPS (AI cluster)\n288GB HBM3e\n\n\n2026\nRubin VR300\n\n50 PFLOPS (FP4) / 1.2 ExaFLOPS (FP8, rack)\n288GB HBM4\n\n\n2027\nRubin Ultra\n\n100 PFLOPS (FP4) / 5 ExaFLOPS (FP8, rack)\n1TB HBM4e (per 4 dies)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow AI models are the main consumers of those processors. The most popular of those are ChatGPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude and Perplexity. ChatGPT-4 is based on the transformer architecture. It is able to handle long conversations and maintain better context over multiple turns. It is stronger in creative writing, technical writing, reasoning tasks, and code generation. It has better performance on logic-heavy tasks and answering technical queries. It is mainly used for chatbots, automated content creation, code writing, customer support, and more advanced AI tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Compute requirements scale exponentially across AI tasks. Source: Michael Dell\n\n\n\nThe computational demands of AI tasks scale exponentially, as illustrated in Figure 1: while a single-shot chatbot represents the baseline (1x), image generation requires ~10x more compute, reasoning tasks need ~100x, video generation demands ~3,000x, and deep research capabilities require over 1,000,000x the baseline. This exponential scaling, based on estimates from OpenAI, Nvidia, and Melius Research, explains why AI companies face persistent capacity constraints despite massive infrastructure investments. As users demand more sophisticated capabilities, the infrastructure requirements grow super-linearly, making access to computational resources an increasingly critical competitive advantage.\nHowever, instead of measuring computing requirements using traditional floating-point arithmetic (FLOPS), the commercial LLM models use token as a unit of computation. A token is a unit of text that is processed by the model. It is typically a word or a phrase. The number of tokens is the number of words or phrases that are processed by the model as inputs or outputs. Two-tree years ago, when you had to adopt an LLM model for a specific tasks, you had to perform fine-tuning of the model. It involved updating the parameters of the model to make it more suitable for your specific task. However, now you will find spend less computing power on fine-tuning and more on using the model as-is and simply providing the tasks-specific instructions and data sets as model context.\nOpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has experienced remarkable growth in both valuation and revenue. As of late 2024, OpenAI reached a valuation of $157 billion following its latest funding round, making it one of the most valuable private companies in the world. The company’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) has grown exponentially, reaching approximately $3.7 billion in 2024, driven primarily by ChatGPT subscriptions and API usage. OpenAI has raised over $13 billion in total funding, with major investors including Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion and maintains a strategic partnership that includes exclusive cloud computing arrangements. This rapid financial growth reflects the massive demand for generative AI capabilities across industries and the transformative potential of large language models.\nClaude is the main competitor of OpenAI. It is supported by Amazon and excels at complex reasoning tasks, problem-solving, and in-depth analysis across a wide range of domains. Claude can write, debug, and explain code in many programming languages. It can analyze images and documents in addition to text and can engage in various conversation styles, from formal analysis to creative writing to casual discussion.\n\n\n\nClaude\n\n\nAmazon has made a significant strategic investment in Anthropic, Claude’s creator, committing up to $4 billion to advance AI safety research and development. This partnership positions Amazon Web Services (AWS) as Anthropic’s primary cloud provider while giving Amazon a minority ownership stake in the company. Unlike ChatGPT, which excels in creative writing and general-purpose conversations, Claude is specifically designed with a focus on safety, harmlessness, and nuanced reasoning. Claude demonstrates superior performance in tasks requiring careful analysis, ethical reasoning, and handling sensitive topics. It employs Constitutional AI training methods that make it more reliable in avoiding harmful outputs and better at acknowledging uncertainty when it doesn’t know something. Recent advances in Claude 3.7 and Claude 4.0 have introduced groundbreaking multimodal capabilities, allowing these models to process and analyze images, documents, and code with unprecedented accuracy. Claude 4.0 represents a significant leap forward in mathematical reasoning, coding assistance, and complex problem-solving tasks, with performance improvements of 40-60% over previous versions in benchmark evaluations. These newer models feature enhanced “thinking” processes that are more transparent, often explaining their reasoning step-by-step with greater depth and clarity, which makes them particularly valuable for educational applications, research assistance, and professional analysis where understanding the AI’s decision-making process is crucial. Claude 4.0 also introduces improved long-context understanding, capable of processing documents up to 200,000 tokens, and demonstrates remarkable advances in scientific reasoning and technical writing. This approach has made Claude increasingly popular among researchers, academics, and professionals who require more thoughtful and contextually aware AI assistance.\nPerplexity synthesizes information from multiple sources and presents it with proper citations. Each response includes references for easy verification. It functions as a conversational search engine. Perplexity has emerged as a formidable competitor to Google Search by offering a fundamentally different approach to information discovery. Unlike traditional search engines that provide links to websites, Perplexity acts as an AI-powered research assistant that directly answers questions while citing sources. The company has attracted significant investment, including backing from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who participated in Perplexity’s $74 million Series B funding round in 2024. This strategic investment reflects growing confidence in AI-first search alternatives that could disrupt Google’s longstanding dominance in the search market.\nThe company has also developed innovative partnerships with major brands like Marriott and Nike, demonstrating how AI search can be integrated into enterprise applications. Marriott has explored using Perplexity’s technology to enhance customer service by providing instant, cited answers about hotel amenities, local attractions, and booking policies. Similarly, Nike has experimented with Perplexity’s capabilities to help customers find specific product information, sizing guides, and availability across different locations. These enterprise partnerships showcase Perplexity’s potential to move beyond general web search into specialized, domain-specific applications.\nPerplexity’s advertising model differs significantly from Google’s traditional approach. Rather than displaying ads alongside search results, Perplexity is exploring sponsored answers and branded content integration that maintains the conversational flow while clearly identifying commercial partnerships. This approach could prove less intrusive than traditional search advertising while providing new revenue streams. The company’s growth trajectory and enterprise adoption suggest it could pose a meaningful challenge to Google’s search monopoly, particularly among users who prefer direct answers over browsing multiple websites.\nThe explosive growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity has been fundamentally enabled by the vast repositories of digital text that have accumulated over the past three decades. The “fuel” powering these sophisticated AI systems comes from an unprecedented collection of human knowledge digitized and made accessible through the internet. Wikipedia alone contains over 60 million articles across hundreds of languages, representing one of humanity’s largest collaborative knowledge projects. Web crawling technologies have systematically captured billions of web pages, blog posts, news articles, and forum discussions, creating massive text corpora that encode diverse writing styles, domains of expertise, and forms of human expression. The digitization of literature through projects like Google Books and Internet Archive has made millions of books searchable and processable, from classical literature to technical manuals. Social media platforms have contributed streams of conversational text, while academic databases provide formal scientific and scholarly writing. This digital text explosion created training datasets containing trillions of words - orders of magnitude larger than what any human could read in multiple lifetimes. By processing these enormous text collections through transformer architectures, LLMs learned statistical patterns of language use, absorbing grammar, syntax, semantics, and even reasoning patterns embedded in human writing. The models discovered how words relate to each other, how concepts connect across different contexts, and how to generate coherent, contextually appropriate responses by predicting the most likely next word given preceding text. This approach allowed AI systems to develop surprisingly sophisticated language understanding and generation capabilities without explicit programming of linguistic rules, instead learning the deep structure of human communication from the collective digital footprint of our species.\nThe mathematical operations used for manipulating and rendering images are the same as those used in deep learning models. Researchers started to use graphical processing units (GPUs) (a.k.a graphics cards) to train deep learning models in the 2010s. The wide availability of GPUs made deep learning modeling accessible for a large number of researchers and engineers and eventually led to the popularity of DL. Recently, several competitive hardware architectures were developed by large companies like Google, which uses its own TPU (Tensor Processing Units) as well as smaller start-ups.\nThis course will focus on practical and theoretical aspects of predicting using deep learning models. Currently, deep learning techniques are almost exclusively used for image analysis and natural language processing and are practiced by a handful of scientists and engineers, most of whom are trained in computer science. However, modern methodologies, software, and the availability of cloud computing make deep learning accessible to a wide range of data scientists who would typically use more traditional predictive models such as generalized linear regression or tree-based methods.\nA unified approach to analyze and apply deep learning models to a wide range of problems that arise in business and engineering is required. To make this happen, we will bring together ideas from probability and statistics, optimization, scalable linear algebra, and high-performance computing. Although deep learning models are very interesting to study from a methodological point of view, the most important aspect of those is the predictive power unseen before with more traditional models. The ability to learn very complex patterns in data and generate accurate predictions makes deep learning a useful and exciting methodology to use. We hope to convey that excitement. This set of notes is self-contained and has a set of references for a reader interested in learning further.\nAlthough basics of probability, statistics, and linear algebra will be revisited, this book is targeted towards students who have completed a course in introductory statistics and high school calculus. We will make extensive use of computational tools, such as R language, as well as PyTorch and TensorFlow libraries for predictive modeling, both for illustration and in homework problems. There are many aspects of data analysis that do not deal with building predictive models, for example, data processing and labeling can require significant human resources(Hermann and Balso 2017; Baylor et al. 2017). Those are not covered in this book.\n\nEnterprise LLM Applications\nLarge language models are rapidly transforming business operations across industries, creating measurable economic value through automation, enhanced decision-making, and new product capabilities. In customer service, companies report 30-50% reductions in support costs by deploying LLM-powered chatbots that handle routine inquiries while escalating complex issues to human agents. Financial institutions use LLMs for document analysis, extracting key information from contracts, regulatory filings, and legal documents at speeds and accuracy levels that far exceed manual review. Software development has been revolutionized by AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, with studies showing developers completing tasks 55% faster when using AI assistance. In healthcare, LLMs assist with clinical documentation, reducing physician administrative burden by automatically generating visit summaries and insurance prior authorization requests. Marketing and content creation industries leverage LLMs for generating product descriptions, email campaigns, and social media content, with some companies reporting 10x increases in content production capacity. Legal firms deploy LLMs for contract review, due diligence, and legal research, compressing weeks of associate work into hours. The pharmaceutical industry uses LLMs to analyze scientific literature and accelerate drug discovery by identifying promising compounds and predicting molecular interactions. Consulting firms employ LLMs to synthesize market research, generate client deliverables, and perform competitive analysis. Education platforms integrate LLMs for personalized tutoring, automated grading, and adaptive learning systems that adjust to individual student needs. Collectively, these applications represent billions of dollars in productivity gains and are fundamentally reshaping knowledge work across sectors, making AI literacy increasingly essential for business professionals and creating strong demand for practitioners who can effectively deploy these technologies.\nIn his talk on “Why are LLMs not Better at Finding Proofs?”, Timothy Gowers discusses that while large language models (LLMs) can display some sensible reasoning—such as narrowing down the search space in a problem—they tend to falter when they get stuck, relying too heavily on intelligent guesswork rather than systematic problem-solving. Unlike humans, who typically respond to a failed attempt with a targeted adjustment based on what went wrong, LLMs often just make another guess that isn’t clearly informed by previous failures. He also highlights a key difference in approach: humans usually build up to a solution incrementally, constructing examples that satisfy parts of the problem and then refining their approach based on the requirements. For example, when trying to prove an existential statement, a human might first find examples satisfying one condition, then look for ways to satisfy additional conditions, adjusting parameters as needed. LLMs, by contrast, are more likely to skip these intermediate steps and try to jump directly to the final answer, missing the structured, iterative reasoning that characterizes human problem-solving.\nWhile there are indeed limitations to what current large language models can solve, particularly in areas requiring systematic mathematical reasoning, they continue to demonstrate remarkable capabilities in solving complex problems through alternative approaches. A notable example is the application of deep learning to the classical three-body problem in physics, a problem that has challenged mathematicians and physicists for centuries. Traditional analytical methods have struggled to find closed-form solutions for the three-body problem, but deep neural networks have shown surprising success in approximating solutions through pattern recognition and optimization techniques. These neural networks can learn the underlying dynamics from training data and generate accurate predictions for orbital trajectories, even when analytical solutions remain elusive. This success demonstrates that the trial-and-error approach, when combined with sophisticated pattern recognition capabilities, can lead to practical solutions for problems that have resisted traditional mathematical approaches. The key insight is that while these methods may not provide the elegant closed-form solutions that mathematicians prefer, they offer valuable computational tools that can advance scientific understanding and enable practical applications in fields ranging from astrophysics to spacecraft navigation.",

    "section": "Bayes: Evidence as Minus Log-Probability",
    "text": "Bayes: Evidence as Minus Log-Probability\nImagine you’re searching for something lost—a missing ship, a hidden treasure, or a city abandoned centuries ago. You have multiple clues: historical documents, geological surveys, satellite imagery, and expert opinions. How do you combine all these disparate pieces of evidence into a coherent search strategy? This is exactly the type of problem where Bayesian reasoning shines, and it’s a powerful framework that underlies many modern AI applications.\nThe Bayesian approach provides a principled mathematical framework for updating our beliefs as new evidence arrives. At its core is Bayes’ rule, which tells us how to revise the probability of a hypothesis given new data:\n\\[\nP(\\text{hypothesis} \\mid \\text{data}) = \\frac{P(\\text{data} \\mid \\text{hypothesis}) \\times P(\\text{hypothesis})}{P(\\text{data})}\n\\]\nWhile this formula is elegant, what makes Bayesian reasoning especially powerful is a simple mathematical trick: when we work with logarithms of probabilities, combining evidence becomes as simple as addition. Taking the logarithm of both sides of Bayes’ rule gives us:\n\\[\n\\log P(\\text{hypothesis} \\mid \\text{data}) = \\log P(\\text{data} \\mid \\text{hypothesis}) + \\log P(\\text{hypothesis}) - \\log P(\\text{data})\n\\]\nThis transformation reveals that the log-posterior (our updated belief) is simply the sum of the log-likelihood (evidence from data) and the log-prior (our initial belief), minus a normalization constant. In other words, on the log scale, we’re just adding up different sources of evidence. Each piece of information contributes its “weight” to the total, and we combine them linearly.\nThis additive property has profound practical implications. When you have multiple independent sources of evidence—say, historical documents, geological surveys, and geophysical measurements—each contributes a term to the sum. Strong evidence adds a large positive contribution, weak evidence adds little, and contradictory evidence subtracts from the total. The beauty is that the mathematical framework handles all the bookkeeping automatically.\nA remarkable application of this principle comes from the world of mineral exploration. In 2022, Aurania Resources announced that they had found the location of Logroño de los Caballeros, a “lost city” of Spanish gold miners that had been abandoned in the jungles of Ecuador for over 400 years. The discovery was made possible by Bayesian search theory, developed by Larry Stone who has a remarkable track record of finding lost objects—including the USS Scorpion nuclear submarine and Air France Flight 447.\nLarry Stone’s approach to finding Logroño exemplifies how Bayesian reasoning combines multiple sources of evidence. The team assembled a mountain of heterogeneous information:\n\nHistorical documents: Spanish colonial records from the 1580s-1590s describing Logroño’s location relative to rivers and other settlements\nArchaeological evidence: A 1574 map by Mendez showing approximate locations\n\nGeological data: Stream sediment samples analyzed for gold content\nGeophysical surveys: Magnetic and radiometric measurements\nModern geography: LiDAR topographic data and current river systems\nGeochemical patterns: Distribution of minerals indicating potential gold sources\n\nEach of these information sources provided a “clue” that was more or less reliable, more or less precise, and potentially contradictory with others. How do you reconcile a 450-year-old account that “Logroño was half a league from the Rio Zamora” with geological evidence suggesting gold-bearing formations in a different area?\nBayesian search theory provides the answer. Bayesian reasoning assigns each piece of evidence a reliability weight and used Bayes’ rule to generate probability maps. Historical documents considered highly reliable (such as official Spanish reports) contributed strongly to the probability distribution, while more ambiguous sources contributed less. Larry Stone, explained: “Our success in integrating historical documents with scientific data using Bayesian methods opens a range of potential applications in the mineral and energy exploration sectors.”\nThe power of this approach became clear when they combined evidence that initially seemed contradictory. A critical breakthrough came from multiple corroborating accounts: Juan Lopez de Avendaño reported in 1588 that Logroño was half a league from the Rio Zamora; that same year, two soldiers drowned crossing “the river” to fight an uprising; in the mid-1590s, seven soldiers drowned trying to reach a downstream garrison; and a 1684 Jesuit account described an elderly woman who remembered hearing Logroño’s church bells from her village at the mouth of the Rio Zamora. Each piece of evidence individually was ambiguous—which river? how far is “half a league”?—but together they pointed to a specific location along the Rio Santiago valley.\nOn the log-probability scale, each piece of evidence either added to or subtracted from the likelihood of different locations. Strong, consistent evidence (multiple drowning accounts suggesting a major river crossing) added significant weight. Weak or contradictory evidence contributed less. The final probability map was literally the sum of these contributions, with the peak probability occurring where the most evidence converged. Figure 2 shows the likelihood ratio surfaces generated for copper, silver, and gold deposits—visual representations of how different evidence sources combine to create probability distributions across the search area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Likelihood ratio surfaces generated by Metron showing potential locations for copper, silver, and gold deposits in Aurania’s concession area. These heat maps visualize how Bayesian analysis combines multiple sources of geological and geophysical evidence into a single probability distribution. Warmer colors indicate higher likelihood ratios where multiple pieces of evidence converge. Source: Metron Inc., via MIT Sloan\n\n\n\nThe result was dramatic: Bayesian reasoning generated probability maps that identified the Rio Santiago valley as the most likely location of Logroño, and subsequent fieldwork confirmed extensive alluvial gold deposits and active artisanal mining exactly where the Bayesian analysis predicted. As Dr. Keith Barron, Aurania’s CEO, noted: “This key discovery can ultimately lead us to Logroño’s gold source.” The location that seemed to reconcile all the disparate evidence—Spanish colonial records, drowning accounts, geological surveys, and modern geography—turned out to be correct.\nThis example illustrates why the Bayesian framework is so powerful in modern AI applications. Machine learning models constantly face the challenge of combining multiple sources of information: pixels in different regions of an image, words in different parts of a sentence, measurements from different sensors. The additive property of log-probabilities provides an efficient computational framework for this fusion. When you train a deep learning model, the loss function essentially measures how well the model combines evidence from the training data with prior knowledge (encoded in the model architecture and regularization). Optimization algorithms adjust model parameters to maximize this combined evidence, updating beliefs exactly as Bayes’ rule prescribes.\nThe mathematical elegance of working with log-probabilities extends beyond search problems. In natural language processing, transformer models compute attention weights that determine how much “evidence” each word provides about the meaning of other words. In computer vision, convolutional networks combine evidence from different receptive fields. In recommendation systems, collaborative filtering combines evidence from multiple users’ preferences. All of these applications benefit from the additive structure that log-probabilities provide.",

    "section": "Examples: AI in Action",
    "text": "Examples: AI in Action\nThe following examples illustrate the remarkable breadth and impact of modern AI applications across diverse domains. From analyzing street signs to predict vehicle steering commands, to discovering cardiovascular risks hidden in eye scans, these cases demonstrate how deep learning models can extract meaningful patterns from complex data that would be impossible for humans to process at scale. Each example showcases a different aspect of AI’s transformative potential: computer vision for autonomous navigation, medical diagnosis through pattern recognition, and creative synthesis that challenges our understanding of artistic expression. These real-world applications reveal how the mathematical foundations we’ll explore throughout this book translate into practical solutions that are reshaping industries and expanding the boundaries of what machines can accomplish.\n\nExample 1 (Updating Google Maps with Deep Learning and Street View.) Every day, Google Maps provides useful directions, real-time traffic information, and information on businesses to millions of people. To provide the best experience for users, this information must constantly mirror an ever-changing world. While Street View cars collect millions of images daily, it is impossible to manually analyze more than 80 billion high-resolution images collected to date to find new or updated information for Google Maps. One of the goals of Google’s Ground Truth team is to enable the automatic extraction of information from geo-located imagery to improve Google Maps.\n(Wojna et al. 2017) describes an approach to accurately read street names out of very challenging Street View images in many countries, automatically, using a deep neural network. The algorithm achieves 84.2% accuracy on the challenging French Street Name Signs (FSNS) dataset, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art systems. Further, the model was extended to extract business names from street fronts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Some examples of FSNS images.\n\n\n\nAnother piece of information that researchers were able to extract from street view is political leanings of a neighborhood based on the vehicles parked on its streets. Using computer algorithms that can see and learn, they have analyzed millions of publicly available images on Google Street View. The researchers say they can use that knowledge to determine the political leanings of a given neighborhood just by looking at the cars on the streets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Types of cars detected in StreetView Images can be used to predict voting patterns\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2 (CNN for Self Driving Car) In 2004 a self-driving vehicle that participated in Darpa’s grand challenge drove 150 miles through the Mojave Desert without human intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Darpa Grand Challenge Flyer from 2004\n\n\n\nCurrent self-driving systems rely on convolutional neural networks (CNN). This is a particular neural network architecture that can be trained to map raw pixels from a single front-facing camera directly to steering commands(Bojarski et al. 2016). This end-to-end approach proved surprisingly powerful. With minimum training data from humans the system learns to drive in traffic on local roads with or without lane markings and on highways. It also operates in areas with unclear visual guidance such as in parking lots and on unpaved roads. The system automatically learns internal representations of the necessary processing steps such as detecting useful road features with only the human steering angle as the training signal. We never explicitly trained it to detect, for example, the outline of roads.\nCompared to explicit decomposition of the problem, such as lane marking detection, path planning, and control, our end-to-end system optimizes all processing steps simultaneously. We argue that this will eventually lead to better performance and smaller systems. Better performance will result because the internal components self-optimize to maximize overall system performance, instead of optimizing human-selected intermediate criteria, e.g., lane detection. Such criteria understandably are selected for ease of human interpretation which doesn’t automatically guarantee maximum system performance. Smaller networks are possible because the system learns to solve the problem with the minimal number of processing steps.\nAn NVIDIA DevBox and Torch 7 were used for training and an NVIDIA Drive PX self-driving car computer also running Torch 7 for determining where to drive. The system operates at 30 FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: The architecture for self driving car\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3 (Predicting Heart disease from eye images) Scientists from Google’s health-tech subsidiary Verily have discovered a new way to assess a person’s risk of heart disease using machine learning (Poplin et al. 2018). By analyzing scans of the back of a patient’s eye, the company’s software is able to accurately deduce data, including an individual’s age, blood pressure, and whether or not they smoke. This can then be used to predict their risk of suffering a major cardiac event — such as a heart attack — with roughly the same accuracy as current leading methods.\nTo train the algorithm, Verily’s scientists used machine learning to analyze a medical dataset of nearly 300,000 patients. This information included eye scans as well as general medical data. As with all deep learning analysis, neural networks were then used to mine this information for patterns, learning to associate telltale signs in the eye scans with the metrics needed to predict cardiovascular risk (e.g., age and blood pressure).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Two images of the fundus, or interior rear of your eye. The one on the left is a regular image; the one on the right shows how Google’s algorithm picks out blood vessels (in green) to predict blood pressure. Photo by Google - Verily Life Sciences\n\n\n\nWhen presented with retinal images of two patients, one of whom suffered a cardiovascular event in the following five years, and one of whom did not, Google’s algorithm was able to tell which was which 70 percent of the time. This is only slightly worse than the commonly used SCORE method of predicting cardiovascular risk, which requires a blood test and makes correct predictions in the same test 72 percent of the time.\nA new Rembrandt painting unveiled in Amsterdam Tuesday has the tech world buzzing more than the art world. “The Next Rembrandt,” as it’s been dubbed, was the brainchild of Bas Korsten, creative director at the advertising firm J. Walter Thompson in Amsterdam.\nThe new portrait is the product of 18 months of analysis of 346 paintings and 150 gigabytes of digitally rendered graphics. Everything about the painting — from the subject matter (a Caucasian man between the age of 30 and 40) to his clothes (black, wide-brimmed hat, black shirt and white collar), facial hair (small mustache and goatee) and even the way his face is positioned (facing right) — was distilled from Rembrandt’s body of work.\n“A computer learned, with artificial intelligence, how to re-create a new Rembrandt right eye,” Korsten explains. “And we did that for all facial features, and after that, we assembled those facial features using the geometrical dimensions that Rembrandt used to use in his own work.” Can you guess which image was generated by the algorithm?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Can you guess which image was generated by the algorithm?\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4 (Learning Person Trajectory Representations for Team Activity Analysis) Activity analysis in which multiple people interact across a large space is challenging due to the interplay of individual actions and collective group dynamics. A recently proposed end-to-end approach (Mehrasa et al. 2017) allows for learning person trajectory representations for group activity analysis. The learned representations encode rich spatio-temporal dependencies and capture useful motion patterns for recognizing individual events, as well as characteristic group dynamics that can be used to identify groups from their trajectories alone. Deep learning was applied in the context of team sports, using the sets of events (e.g. pass, shot) and groups of people (teams). Analysis of events and team formations using NHL hockey and NBA basketball datasets demonstrate the generality of applicability of DL to sports analytics.\nWhen activities involve multiple people distributed in space, the relative trajectory patterns of different people can provide valuable cues for activity analysis. We learn rich trajectory representations that encode useful information for recognizing individual events as well as overall group dynamics in the context of team sports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Hockey trajectory analysis visualization\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5 (EPL Liverpool Prediction) Liverpool FC has become a benchmark in football for integrating advanced data analytics into both their recruitment and on-field strategies. The Expected Possession Value (EPV) pitch map shown below displays the likelihood that possession from a given location will result in a goal, with red areas indicating high-value zones where Liverpool’s chances of scoring increase significantly when they gain or retain the ball. Liverpool’s analysts use these EPV maps to inform tactical decisions and player positioning, allowing the coaching staff to instruct players to press, pass, or move into these high-value zones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Expected Possession Value (EPV) pitch map\n\n\n\nOn April 26, 2019, Liverpool scored their fastest-ever Premier League goal—Naby Keita found the net just 15 seconds into the match against Huddersfield Town, setting the tone for a dominant 5-0 victory. This remarkable goal exemplified Liverpool’s data-driven approach to football. Keita’s immediate pressure on Huddersfield’s Jon Gorenc Stankovic was not random—it was a calculated move informed by analytics revealing Huddersfield’s vulnerability when building from the back under pressure. This demonstrates the effective application of Expected Possession Value (EPV) principles. Liverpool’s analysts systematically study opponent build-up patterns, using video and tracking data to predict where and how opponents are likely to play the ball from kick-off or in early possession phases. This intelligence allows Liverpool players to position themselves strategically for maximum disruption. When Huddersfield’s goalkeeper played out from the back, Keita was already moving to intercept, anticipating the pass route—a behavior that had been drilled through analytics-driven preparation and scenario planning.\n\n\nExample 6 (SailGP) SailGP is a global sailing championship that represents the pinnacle of competitive sailing, featuring identical F50 foiling catamarans raced by national teams. Unlike traditional sailing competitions, the series combines high-performance sailing with advanced analytics, real-time data processing, and 5G connectivity to create a modern, technology-driven sport where success depends as much on data analysis and optimization as traditional sailing skills. SailGP races take place in iconic venues around the world, with teams representing countries competing in a season-long championship format that emphasizes both athletic excellence and technological innovation.\n\n\n\nEmirates GBR SailGP Team F50 Race. Source:Wikimedia.\n\n\nOracle’s co-founder Larry Ellison is a pioneer and a significant investor in sailing analytics and technology, particularly through his involvement with Oracle Team USA and the America’s Cup. His team’s success in the 2010 and 2013 America’s Cup campaigns demonstrated how data analysis done in real-time could provide competitive advantages. His approach has influenced the development of modern sailing competitions like SailGP.\nJimmy Spithill is a veteran of eight consecutive America’s Cup campaigns. His most legendary achievement came in 2013 with ORACLE TEAM USA, where he led what is widely acclaimed as one of the greatest comebacks in sporting history. After falling behind 8-1 in the best-of-17 series against Emirates Team New Zealand, Spithill and his team faced seemingly insurmountable odds. No team had ever come back from such a deficit in America’s Cup history.\nThe turning point came after the 8-1 loss when the team made a critical technological decision. They installed additional sensors throughout the boat to collect more comprehensive data about performance, wind conditions, and boat dynamics. These sensors provided real-time feedback that allowed the team to make precise adjustments to their sailing strategy and boat configuration.\nWith the enhanced data collection system in place, ORACLE TEAM USA began their historic comeback, winning eight consecutive races to claim the America’s Cup with a final score of 9-8. The victory demonstrated how the integration of advanced sensor technology and data analytics could provide the competitive edge needed to overcome even the most daunting deficits.\nThis 2013 comeback remains a defining moment in sailing history, showcasing how the marriage of traditional sailing skill with cutting-edge technology can produce extraordinary results. Spithill’s leadership during this period highlighted the importance of adaptability and the willingness to embrace technological solutions when facing adversity.\nOne of the main features is velocity made good (VMG), which calculates the optimal course to maximize speed toward the mark while accounting for wind direction and current. Tack and gybe optimization uses statistical modeling to determine the optimal timing for direction changes based on wind shifts, boat speed, and course geometry. Layline calculations employ predictive analytics to determine the optimal approach angles to marks, minimizing distance sailed.\nFurther, boundary layer modeling provides statistical analysis of wind gradients across the racecourse to identify optimal sailing lanes. Weather routing uses optimization algorithms that consider multiple weather models to find the fastest route between marks.\nPressure sensors combined with models of flow dynamics of hydrofoils allow for calculating optimal foil position. Sail trim analysis examines statistical correlation between sail settings, wind conditions, and boat speed. Weight distribution modeling optimizes crew positioning and ballast distribution based on real-time conditions.\nReal-time dashboards display statistical process control charts showing performance metrics against historical benchmarks. Predictive modeling employs machine learning algorithms that forecast optimal strategies based on current conditions and historical performance.\nThe statistical foundation relies heavily on time series analysis, regression modeling, and Monte Carlo simulations to account for the inherent variability in wind and sea conditions. Teams use Bayesian inference to update their models in real-time as new data becomes available during races, creating a dynamic optimization system that continuously refines strategy based on actual performance data.\nThe LinkedIn article by Van Loon describes how SailGP provides a good summary of modern evolution of traditional sailing competitions, leveraging cutting-edge technology to enhance both performance and spectator experience.\nThere are over 1,000 sensors on a SailGP boat that generate an astonishing 52 billion data points per race, providing unprecedented insights into boat performance, wind conditions, and crew actions.\nSailGP’s approach demonstrates how modern sports are increasingly becoming technology competitions as much as athletic competitions, with success depending heavily on the ability to collect, process, and act on real-time data effectively. This represents a significant shift from traditional sailing, where success was primarily determined by experience, intuition, and traditional sailing skills.\n\n\nExample 7 (Google Energy) In 2016, Google’s DeepMind published a white paper outlining their approach to save energy in data centers. Reducing energy usage has been a major focus for data center operators over the past 10 years. Major breakthroughs, however, are few and far between, but Google managed to reduce the amount of energy used for cooling by up to 40 percent. In any large-scale energy-consuming environment, this would be a huge improvement. Given how sophisticated Google’s data centers are, even a small reduction in energy will lead to large savings. DeepMind used a system of neural networks trained on different operating scenarios and parameters within their data centers, creating a more efficient and adaptive framework to understand data center dynamics and optimize efficiency.\nTo accomplish this, the historical data that had already been collected by thousands of sensors within the data center – data such as temperatures, power, pump speeds, setpoints, etc. – was used to train an ensemble of deep neural networks. Since the objective was to improve data center energy efficiency, the model was trained on the average future PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness), which is defined as the ratio of the total building energy usage to the IT energy usage. Two ensembles of deep neural networks were developed to predict the future temperature and pressure of the data center over the next hour. The purpose of these predictions is to simulate the recommended actions from the PUE model, to ensure that we do not go beyond any operating constraints.\nThe DL system was able to consistently achieve a 40 percent reduction in the amount of energy used for cooling, which equates to a 15 percent reduction in overall PUE overhead after accounting for electrical losses and other non-cooling inefficiencies. It also produced the lowest PUE the site had ever seen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: DL system was able to consistently achieve a 40 percent reduction in the amount of energy used for cooling, which equates to a 15 percent reduction in overall PUE overhead after accounting for electrical losses and other non-cooling inefficiencies. It also produced the lowest PUE the site had ever seen.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8 (Chess and Backgammon) The game of Chess is the most studied domain in AI. Many bright minds attempted to build an algorithm that can beat a human master. Both Alan Turing and John von Neumann, who are considered pioneers of AI, developed Chess algorithms. Historically, highly specialized systems, such as IBM’s DeepBlue have been successful in chess.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Kasparov vs IBM’s DeepBlue in 1997\n\n\n\nMost of those systems are based on alpha-beta search, handcrafted by human grand masters. Human inputs are used to design game-specific heuristics that allow truncating moves which are unlikely to lead to a win.\nRecent implementations of chess robots rely on deep learning models. (Silver et al. 2017) shows a simplified example of a binary-linear value function \\(v\\), which assigns a numeric score to each board position \\(s\\). The value function parameters \\(w\\) are estimated from outcomes of a series of self-play and is represented as dot product of a binary feature vector \\(x(s)\\) and the learned weight vector \\(w\\): e.g. value of each piece. Then, each future position is evaluated by summing weights of active features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Chess Algorithm, \\(v(s,w)\\) denotes value of strategy, \\(s\\), given the learned weights, \\(w\\).\n\n\n\nBefore deep learning models were used for Go and Chess, IBM used them to develop a backgammon robot, which they called TD-Gammon (Tesauro 1995). TD-Gammon uses a deep learning model as a value function which predicts the value, or reward, of a particular state of the game for the current player.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Backgammon Algorithm: Tree-Search for Backgammon policies\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9 (Alpha Go and Move 37) One of the great challenges of computational games was to conquer the ancient Chinese game of Go. The number of possible board positions is \\(10^{960}\\) which prevents us from using tree search algorithms as it was done with chess. There are only \\(10^{170}\\) possible chess positions. Alpha Go uses 2 deep learning neural networks to assist a move and to evaluate a position: a policy network for move recommendation and a value network for current evaluation (who will win?).\nThe policy network was initially trained with supervised learning with data fed from human master games. Then, it was trained in unsupervised mode by playing against itself. The value network was trained based on the outcome of games. A key trick is to reduce breadth of search space by only considering moves recommended by the policy network. The next advance is to reduce depth of search space by replacing search space sub trees with a single value created by the value network.\nThe game is played by performing a Monte Carlo tree search which we illustrate in Figure 15. The algorithm involves traversing the tree using highest recommended moves that haven’t been picked yet, expanding leaf nodes and evaluating with both policy and value networks, and backing up through the tree and storing mean evaluation at each node of its leaf nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Steps of Monte Carlo tree search\n\n\n\nAlphaGo won 4-1 vs. Lee Sedol, but the loss was informative.\nAlphaGo Zero is the next iteration of the algorithm that removes all human knowledge from the training process. It uses no human data - only self play, no human features - only takes raw board as input, a single neural network - combining policy and value networks into a single network, and simpler search - no randomized monte-carlo rollout - only uses NN evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Alpha GO vs Lee Sedol: Move 37 by AlphaGo in Game Two\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10 (Game of Thrones) A fan of HBO’s Game of Thrones saga who could not wait until the next chapter of the A Song of Ice and Fire book it is based on comes out, used a deep learning model to generate one. He used recurrent neural networks which were trained on the previous chapters. First, each of the 32,000 unique words in the text were enumerated and then the machine learned some plot points and was able to generate new patterns of text.\nIn August 2023, George R.R. Martin, author of the “A Song of Ice and Fire” series that inspired Game of Thrones, joined a lawsuit against OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. The lawsuit alleges that OpenAI used copyrighted material from the New York Times, including articles about Game of Thrones, to train its AI models without permission. While not directly about the show itself, Martin’s involvement draws a connection due to his authorship of the source material. Here is the reply ChatGPT 5 gives for the Can you tell (in 1 paragraph) about Copyright lawsuit related to Game of Thrones? query.\n\nA notable copyright-lawsuit related to the Game of Thrones universe involves its original author George R.R. Martin plus a group of 16 other prominent writers who filed a suit in September 2023 against OpenAI. They claim that OpenAI’s large-language model (the one behind ChatGPT) was trained on their copyrighted works without permission and now can generate unauthorized derivative material—such as a detailed outline of a prequel to Martin’s epic fantasy series called “A Dawn of Direwolves.” The suit argues this constitutes “systematic theft on a mass scale” and seeks an injunction preventing further unauthorized use of authors’ works, as well as damages.",

Whether we’re processing text, images, audio, or even chess board positions, the first step is always the same: convert the raw data into numerical vectors that capture the essential patterns and relationships. In natural language processing, this transformation begins with tokenization, where text is broken down into discrete units called tokens. A token might represent a word, part of a word, or even individual characters, depending on the tokenization strategy.\nFor example, the sentence “Hello world!” might be tokenized into three tokens: [“Hello”, “world”, “!”]. Each token is then mapped to a unique numerical identifier and eventually transformed into a high-dimensional vector that encodes semantic meaning, grammatical role, and contextual relationships with other tokens. For example, the sentence “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” might be tokenized into nine tokens: [“The”, “quick”, “brown”, “fox”, “jumps”, “over”, “the”, “lazy”, “dog”]. Each token is then mapped to a unique numerical identifier and eventually transformed into a high-dimensional vector that encodes semantic meaning, grammatical role, and contextual relationships with other tokens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR\n    A[\"Text:&lt;br/&gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"] --&gt; B[\"Tokens:&lt;br/&gt;['The','quick','brown','fox','jumps','over','the','lazy','dog']\"]\n    B --&gt; C[\"Token IDs (example):&lt;br/&gt;[102, 451, 317, 890, 775, 233, 117, 642, 508]\"]\n    C --&gt; D[\"Embeddings:&lt;br/&gt;each ID -&gt; vector in R^d\"]\n    D --&gt; E[\"Model computes with vectors (attention, etc.)\"]\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Tokenization of “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” into tokens, token IDs, and embeddings.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider a simple example using a vocabulary of just four words: [“cat”, “dog”, “runs”, “sleeps”]. We might assign these tokens the numerical IDs [1, 2, 3, 4] respectively. The sentence “cat runs” would become the token sequence [1, 3]. However, these raw IDs don’t capture semantic relationships—they treat “cat” and “dog” as completely unrelated despite both being animals. This is where vector embeddings become powerful. Instead of simple IDs, each token is represented by a vector like: cat = [0.2, 0.8, 0.1], dog = [0.3, 0.7, 0.2], runs = [0.9, 0.1, 0.8], sleeps = [0.1, 0.1, 0.9]. These learned vectors position similar concepts closer together in the multidimensional space—notice how “cat” and “dog” have similar first two values, while “runs” and “sleeps” (both actions) differ more dramatically. This vector representation enables AI models to perform mathematical operations that capture semantic relationships: the vectors for “cat” and “dog” are closer to each other than to “runs” or “sleeps”, reflecting their shared conceptual category as animals.\n\nExample 11 (Semantic Relations) One of the most intriguing aspects of vector representations is their ability to capture semantic relationships through simple arithmetic operations. In natural language processing, this is famously illustrated by analogies such as “king - man + woman ≈ queen,” where the difference between “king” and “man” encodes the concept of royalty, and adding “woman” shifts the meaning to “queen.” This property emerges because the learned vectors for words, phrases, or even entities are organized in such a way that similar relationships are reflected as consistent directions in the high-dimensional space. The same principle applies beyond language: for example, in sports analytics, we might find that the vector for “Ovechkin” (a star hockey player) plus the vector for “Capitals” (his team) minus the vector for “Gretzky” (another legendary player) yields a vector close to “Oilers” (Gretzky’s team), capturing the underlying relationships between players and their teams. \\[\n\\text{Ovechkin + Capitals - Gretzky = Oilers}\n\\]\nThis ability to perform analogical reasoning with vectors is not limited to words or names—it extends to images, audio, and even structured data like chess positions. In computer vision, for instance, the difference between the vector representations of two images might correspond to a specific transformation, such as changing the background or adding an object. In recommendation systems, the vector difference between a user’s preferences and an item’s features can help identify the best match. These semantic relations, encoded as vector arithmetic, enable AI systems to generalize, reason, and make creative associations across domains. The power of this approach lies in its universality: once information is embedded in a vector space, the same mathematical tools can be used to uncover patterns and relationships, regardless of the original data type.\n\nThe vectorization concept becomes particularly clear when we examine how chess positions can be represented numerically. A chess board contains 64 squares, each of which can be empty or occupied by one of 12 different piece types (6 pieces \\(\\times\\) 2 colors). We can represent any chess position as a vector by simply listing the contents of each square in order. For instance, we might use the encoding: empty=0, white pawn=1, white rook=2, …, white king=6, black pawn=7, black rook=8, …, black king=12. A chess position would then become a 64-dimensional vector like [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 10, 9, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …] representing the starting position with black pieces on the back rank, black pawns on the second rank, and so forth. More sophisticated representations might include additional dimensions for castling rights, en passant possibilities, or whose turn it is to move, creating vectors of 70 or more dimensions. This numerical representation allows chess engines to use the same mathematical operations that work for language or images. The AI can learn that certain vector patterns (piece configurations) are more advantageous than others, and it can mathematically compute how different moves transform one position vector into another. Modern chess engines like AlphaZero process millions of these position vectors to evaluate potential moves, demonstrating how any complex domain can be reduced to vector operations that computers excel at manipulating.\nThe power of vector representations lies in their ability to capture complex relationships through simple mathematical operations. Similarity between objects can be measured using cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. Linear combinations of vectors can represent mixtures of concepts. This mathematical framework enables the development of powerful algorithms for classification, clustering, and generation tasks.\nWhile machines use numerical vectors to represent information, humans rely on distinct cognitive systems for processing different types of data. A revealing case study of human representational architecture emerged from informal experiments that Richard Feynman and John Tukey conducted as graduate students at Princeton in 1939 (Gleick 1992). The pair devised a playful challenge: could they accurately count time intervals while engaged in other cognitive tasks? To test the limits of their mental abilities under physical stress, they would race up and down staircases, elevating their heart rates, all while attempting to maintain accurate internal counts of seconds and steps. Their results revealed a fascinating asymmetry. When Feynman attempted to speak while counting, his time-keeping accuracy collapsed; yet he could read text without any degradation in counting performance. Tukey exhibited precisely the opposite pattern—he maintained accurate counts while reciting poetry aloud, but his performance suffered significantly when reading. This complementary breakdown pattern, discovered decades before formal cognitive psychology established the framework, inadvertently demonstrated what researchers now call working memory’s dual slave systems: the phonological loop handling auditory-verbal information and the visuo-spatial sketchpad processing visual-spatial data. Feynman’s counting strategy evidently relied on verbal-auditory representations (hence interference with speech but not vision), while Tukey employed visual-spatial mental representations (producing the inverse interference pattern). This historical example underscores a fundamental difference between biological and artificial intelligence: human cognition evolved specialized, domain-specific processing channels, whereas modern AI systems operate on domain-general vector representations that process text, images, and structured data through identical mathematical operations.",

    "text": "How did those Machines Learn?\nThe second key idea is to use loss function to combine information from multiple sources represented as vectors into a single number that measures how well model performs the task at hand, e.g. text generation or image classification. This is a key idea in modern AI.\nWhile vector representations provide the language, loss functions provide the learning signal that guides AI systems toward better performance. The loss function is particularly important because it connects probabilistic reasoning with optimization, creating a bridge between statistical theory and practical implementation. The combination of learned vector representations and loss functions has enabled remarkable advances across AI domains:\nNatural Language Processing: Modern language models like GPT and BERT learn contextual vector representations of words and sentences. The loss function ensures that the representations capture semantic relationships that are useful for tasks like translation, summarization, and question answering.\nComputer Vision: Convolutional neural networks learn hierarchical feature representations, from low-level edges and textures to high-level object parts and categories. The loss function ensures these representations are optimized for the specific task, whether it’s object detection, segmentation, or image generation.\nRecommendation Systems: User and item representations are learned simultaneously, with the loss function measuring how well the model predicts user preferences. This approach has revolutionized recommendation engines at companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify.\nMulti-Modal AI: The latest frontier in artificial intelligence represents information from multiple modalities—text, images, audio, and video—in shared vector spaces. This enables models like GPT-4V, DALL-E, and CLIP to understand and generate content across different media types. For instance, a multi-modal model can analyze a photograph and generate a detailed textual description, or conversely, create images from text prompts. The loss function in these systems ensures that semantically related concepts across different modalities are positioned closely in the shared vector space—the vector for the word “cat” should be near the vector for an actual cat image. This breakthrough has enabled applications ranging from automated image captioning and visual question answering to sophisticated content creation tools that seamlessly blend text and imagery.\n\nLet us suppose we have set up a machine with certain initial instruction tables, so constructed that these tables might on occasion, if good reason arose, modify those tables. One can imagine that after the machine had been operating for some time, the instructions would have altered out of all recognition, but nevertheless still be such that one would have to admit that the machine was still doing very worthwhile calculations. Possibly it might still be getting results of the type desired when the machine was first set up, but in a much more efficient manner. In such a case one would have to admit that the progress of the machine had not been foreseen when its original instructions were put in. It would be like a pupil who had learnt much from his master, but had added much more by his own work. When this happens I feel that one is obliged to regard the machine as showing intelligence. (Turing 1950)\n\nModern large language models (LLMs) operationalize Turing’s vision. They begin with random parameters and a simple learning rule, and through exposure to vast text corpora they continually modify their own internal tables (weights) to compress, predict, and thereby internalize regularities of language and the world. The mechanism is straightforward:\n\nText is tokenized and mapped to vectors (embeddings). Similar tokens occupy nearby points in a high-dimensional space, as in early word-vector models (Mikolov et al. 2013).\nA transformer computes contextual representations via attention and feed-forward layers (Vaswani et al. 2023). Attention learns where to look; the feed-forward layers learn what to compute given that context.\nThe model predicts the next token. Errors are measured by a loss and used to update weights by gradient descent, subtly rewriting its own instruction tables on every batch.\n\nThis objective does not explicitly ask for grammar, facts, or reasoning. Yet these capabilities emerge because they help reduce prediction error. Syntax reduces uncertainty about what can come next; factual knowledge reduces uncertainty about named entities and relations; reasoning helps when surface cues are insufficient. Over time, internal vectors reorganize so that directions in representation space align with concepts (e.g., tense, number, sentiment) and relations (e.g., subject–verb agreement, coreference, part–whole). Earlier we saw how vector spaces can encode analogies; in LLMs, entire layers compose such directions so that rich concepts become linearly or near-linearly accessible.\nIntuitively, the model learns concepts by clustering and separating patterns that repeatedly co-occur in context. If tokens and phrases that describe, say, “photosynthesis” often appear with “chlorophyll,” “light,” and “glucose,” the model will place their vectors so these ideas are nearby and distinguishable from unrelated topics. The model learns relations by assigning attention to the right places and by computing transformations that map one concept to another. Certain attention heads specialize (e.g., long-distance agreement), while feed-forward pathways implement conditional rules that activate only in specific contexts. Together, these circuits encode who-did-what-to-whom, temporal order, causality hints, and definitions.\nFrom a systems perspective, LLM learning resembles compression with side information: the network restructures its internal space to represent frequent, useful regularities with short descriptions, while preserving the capacity to disambiguate rare cases. As scale grows (data, model size, compute), the representation becomes more detailed and compositional, allowing the model to recombine known pieces into new, coherent outputs.\nWhy does this produce seemingly abstract knowledge? Because the cheapest way to predict language at scale is to internalize the latent structure that generated it: human conventions of grammar, stable facts about the world, common-sense regularities, and task patterns (definitions, explanations, step-by-step solutions). The network’s continual self-modification—Turing’s pupil—pushes its internal tables toward representations that make these regularities linearly separable and compositionally usable during generation.",

    "text": "Generative AI\nThe landscape of Artificial Intelligence is rapidly being reshaped by the rise of Generative AI (Gen AI). As of 2025, Gen AI has moved beyond hype and into practical application across a multitude of personal and professional domains. A recent article in the Harvard Business Review, “How People Are Really Using Gen AI in 2025” by Marc Zao-Sanders, highlights this shift, noting that user interest has significantly increased and investment in AI is skyrocketing.\nThe article reveals a fascinating trend: a move from purely technical applications towards more emotive and personal uses. The top use cases in 2025 reflect this, with “Therapy/companionship” leading the list. Other prominent uses include “Organizing my life,” “Finding purpose,” “Enhanced learning,” and “Generating code (for pros).” This indicates that individuals are leveraging Gen AI not just for productivity, but also for personal development and well-being.\nSome concrete examples of how people are using Gen AI, as cited in the article, include providing accessible mental health support and a sense of connection (therapy/companionship), especially in regions with limited access to human therapists where users find AI to be available 24/7 and non-judgmental. People are also creating timelines for tasks, planning daily habits, and managing personal projects (organizing my life), using AI as a study guide to explain complex topics and reinforce learning (enhanced learning), generating meal plans based on specific dietary needs and macro calculations (healthier living), planning detailed vacations, including finding rustic accommodations and hidden gems while optimizing travel time (creating travel itineraries), and drafting appeal letters for things like parking tickets (disputing fines).\nThe article also points to the increasing sophistication of Gen AI users, who are developing a deeper understanding of the technology’s capabilities and limitations, including concerns around data privacy and the potential for over-reliance.\nBelow is an image from the HBR article summarizing the top 10 use cases:\n\n\n\nTop 10 Gen AI Use Cases in 2025. Source: Harvard Business Review, “How People Are Really Using Gen AI in 2025”, April 9, 2025.\n\n\nSource: Marc Zao-Sanders, “How People Are Really Using Gen AI in 2025,” Harvard Business Review, April 9, 2025, https://hbr.org/2025/04/how-people-are-really-using-gen-ai-in-2025.\nThe continued evolution of Gen AI promises even more sophisticated applications in the future, moving from providing information to taking action (agentic behavior).\nThe computer therapist is not something new. In 1966, Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA, a computer program that could simulate a conversation with a psychotherapist. ELIZA used simple pattern matching to respond to user inputs, creating the illusion of understanding. The program worked by identifying keywords in user statements and transforming them into questions or reflective responses. For example, if a user typed “I am sad,” ELIZA might respond with “Why do you think you are sad?” or “Tell me more about being sad.” While it was a groundbreaking achievement at the time, it lacked true comprehension and relied on scripted responses.\nWhat surprised Weizenbaum was not just that ELIZA worked, but how readily people attributed human-like understanding to the program. Users began forming emotional attachments to ELIZA, sharing deeply personal information and believing the computer genuinely cared about their problems. Some even requested private sessions without Weizenbaum present. This phenomenon, now known as the ELIZA effect, describes the human tendency to unconsciously assume computer behaviors are analogous to human behaviors, even when we know better intellectually.\nThe ELIZA effect reveals something profound about human psychology: we are predisposed to anthropomorphize systems that exhibit even rudimentary conversational abilities. This has significant implications for modern AI systems. Today’s large language models like ChatGPT and Claude are vastly more sophisticated than ELIZA, yet they still operate through pattern matching and statistical prediction rather than genuine understanding. However, their responses are so fluent and contextually appropriate that the ELIZA effect is amplified dramatically. Users often attribute consciousness, emotions, and intentionality to these systems, leading to both beneficial therapeutic interactions and concerning over-reliance on AI for emotional support.\nUnderstanding the ELIZA effect is crucial as we navigate the current AI landscape. While AI can provide valuable assistance for mental health support, learning, and personal organization, we must remain aware that these systems are sophisticated pattern matchers rather than conscious entities. The therapeutic value may be real—many users do find comfort and insight through AI interactions—but it stems from the human capacity for self-reflection prompted by the conversation, not from genuine empathy or understanding on the machine’s part.",

    "text": "AI Agents\nThe success of deep learning models has led to the development of software libraries that abstract away the complexity of implementing these components. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide efficient implementations of both vector operations and loss functions, making it possible for practitioners to focus on the high-level design of their AI systems rather than the low-level implementation details. Modern deep learning models used for Large Language Models (LLMs) are developed using these libraries.\nHowever, a language model alone isn’t enough to solve complex tasks that require multiple steps and external tools. To solve complex tasks, you need AI agents—software systems that perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with other systems by using reasoning and tool use. Unlike traditional software, agents can dynamically adapt their behavior based on input, context, and goals. Cloud providers like Nebius and AWS provide “orchestration” services that allow practitioners to focus on the high-level design of their AI systems and agents rather than the low-level implementation details.\nFor example, Nebius AI Studio provides a production-grade platform specifically designed for deploying AI agents at enterprise scale. Unlike traditional cloud providers that focus on basic infrastructure, Nebius addresses the core challenges teams face when moving from prototype agents to production systems: cost optimization, observability, evaluation frameworks, and seamless integration with existing workflows. The platform offers access to over 30 open-source models including Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, and Qwen through two pricing tiers—a fast tier with sub-2-second response times for live applications, and a base tier that cuts costs in half for batch workloads. With competitive pricing at $0.38 per million output tokens for Qwen2.5 72B while generating 70+ tokens per second, teams can achieve both performance and cost efficiency.\nThe platform’s strength lies in its production-ready agent orchestration capabilities. Through OpenAI-compatible APIs and integrations with frameworks like CrewAI, Google ADK, LangChain, and Agno, developers can build sophisticated multi-agent systems without vendor lock-in. For instance, a Financial Document Processing Agent for a multinational bank could leverage Nebius’s infrastructure to analyze millions of loan applications, contracts, and compliance documents across multiple languages. The system would use the fast tier for real-time customer interactions while processing bulk document analysis through the cost-efficient base tier. Integration with agent frameworks like CrewAI would orchestrate specialized agents—a document classifier, risk assessor, and compliance checker—working collaboratively. The platform’s built-in observability tools would monitor agent decision paths, track performance metrics, and implement human-in-the-loop approval workflows for high-stakes financial decisions. This architecture ensures regulatory compliance while maintaining the speed and accuracy required for enterprise financial operations, demonstrating how modern AI infrastructure enables sophisticated agent deployments that were previously accessible only to the largest technology companies.\nAs AI continues to evolve, these two pillars remain central to the field’s progress. New architectures and training methods build upon these foundations, but the fundamental principles of learning meaningful vector representations and optimizing them through appropriate loss functions continue to drive innovation in artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\n\nBaylor, Denis, Eric Breck, Heng-Tze Cheng, Noah Fiedel, Chuan Yu Foo, Zakaria Haque, Salem Haykal, et al. 2017. “Tfx: A Tensorflow-Based Production-Scale Machine Learning Platform.” In Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 1387–95.

    "text": "1.1 Bernoulli’s Problem\nProbability deals with randomness. The art of data science is being able to “separate” signal from noise. For example, we need to account for randomness in human behavior. A random phenomenon, by its very nature, means a precise prediction of an outcome has to be described by a distribution. Surprisingly, random events typically have statistical regularity in many ways. For example, if we flip a coin, it would be hard to predict the outcome (head or tail) on an individual flip, but if we flip a coin many times and count the proportion of heads, the average will converge to something close to \\(1/2\\). This is called the law of large numbers.\nProbability is a language that lets you communicate information about uncertain outcomes and events. By assigning a numeric value between zero and one to an event, or a collection of outcomes, in its simplest form, probability measures how likely an event is to occur.\nOur goal here is to introduce you to the concepts of probability, conditional probability and their governing rules. The crowning achievement being Bayes rule for updating conditional probabilities. Understanding these concepts serves as a basis for more complex data analysis and machine learning algorithms. Building probabilistic models has many challenges and real world applications. You are about to learn about practical examples from fields as diverse as medical diagnosis, chess games to racetrack odds.\nWe start by defining probabilities of a finite number of events. An axiomatic approach was proposed by Kolmogorov. This approach is very powerful and allows us to derive many important results and rules for calculating probabilities. Furthermore, in this chapter, we will discuss the notion of conditional probability and independence as well as tools for summarizing the distribution of a random variable, namely expectation and variance.\nThe study of probability arose in part due to interest in understanding games of chance, like cards or dice. These games provide useful examples of many statistical concepts because when we repeat these games the likelihood of different outcomes remains (mostly) the same (statistical regularity). The first rigorous treatment of probability was presented by Jacob Bernoulli in his paper “Ars Conjectandi” (art of guesses) where he claims that to make a guess is the same thing as to measure a probability.\nBernoulli considered the following problem. Suppose that we observe \\(m\\) successes and \\(n\\) failures of an event \\(A\\), out of total \\(N=m+n\\) trials. How do we assign a probability to the event \\(A\\)? A classic definition of the probability (due to Jacob Bernoulli) is the ratio of number of favorable outcomes \\(m\\) to the total number of outcomes \\(N\\), which is the sum of \\(m\\) and the number of unfavorable outcomes \\(n\\) \\[\nP_N = \\dfrac{m}{m+n} = \\dfrac{m}{N}.\n\\]\nMoreover, can we construct a law of succession? What is the probability that the next trial will be a success, given that there are uncertainties in the underlying probabilities? Keynes (1921) considered the rule of succession a.k.a. induction. For example, Bernoulli proposed that \\[\nP_{N+1} = \\dfrac{m+1}{N+2}.\n\\] Keynes (1921) (p. 371) provided a fully Bayesian model based on what we know today as the Beta-Binomial model. Chapter 3 provides a full analysis. The determination of the predictive rule is equivalent to the problem of finding a sufficient statistic (a.k.a. summary statistic) and performing feature engineering in modern day artificial intelligence applications.\nde Finetti puts this in the framework of exchangeable random variables, see Kreps (1988) for further discussion. Jeffreys provides an alternative approach based on the principle of indifference. \\[\nP_{N+1} = \\dfrac{m+1/2}{N+1}.\n\\] Ramsey (1926) and de Finetti (1937) and Savage (1956) use a purely axiomatic approach in an effort to operationalize probability. In a famous quote de Finetti says “the probability does not exist”. In this framework, probability is subjective and operationalized as a willingness to bet. If a gamble \\(A\\) pays $1 if it happens and $0 otherwise, then the willingness to bet 50 cents to enter the gamble implies the subjective probability of \\(A\\) is 0.5. Contrary to the frequentist approach, the probability is not a property of the event, but a property of the person. This is the basis for the Bayesian approach to probability.\nLeonard Jimmie Savage, an American statistician, developed a decision theory framework known as the “Savage axioms” or the “Sure-Thing Principle.” This framework is a set of axioms that describe how a rational decision-maker should behave in the face of uncertainty. These axioms provide a foundation for subjective expected utility theory.\nThe Savage axioms consist of three main principles:\nSavage’s axioms provide a basis for the development of subjective expected utility theory. In this theory, decision-makers are assumed to assign subjective probabilities to different outcomes and evaluate acts based on the expected utility, which is a combination of the utility of outcomes and the subjective probabilities assigned to those outcomes.\nSavage’s framework has been influential in shaping the understanding of decision-making under uncertainty. It allows for a more flexible approach to decision theory that accommodates subjective beliefs and preferences. However, it’s worth noting that different decision theorists may have alternative frameworks, and there are ongoing debates about the appropriateness of various assumptions in modeling decision-making.\nFrequency probability is based on the idea that the probability of an event can be found by repeating the experiment many times and probability arises from some random process on the sample space (such as random selection). For example, if we toss a coin many times, the probability of getting a head is the number of heads divided by the total number of tosses. This is the basis for the frequentist approach to probability.\nAnother way, sometimes more convenient, to talk about uncertainty and to express probabilities via odds, such as 9 to 2 or 3 to 1. We assign odds “on \\(A\\)” or “against \\(A\\)”. For example, when we say that the odds on a Chicago Bears’ Super Bowl win are 2 to 9, it means that if they are to play 11 times (9+2), they will win 2 times. If \\(A\\) is the win event, then odds on \\(A\\) \\[\nO(A) = \\dfrac{P(\\mbox{not A}) }{P(A)} = \\dfrac{1-P(A)}{P(A)}\n\\] Equivalently, probabilities can be determined from odds \\[\nP(A) = \\dfrac{1}{1+O(A)}\n\\] For example, if the odds are one \\(O(A) = 1\\), then for every $1 bet you will pay out $1. This event has probability \\(0.5\\).\nIf \\(O(A) = 2\\), then you are willing to offer \\(2:1\\). For a $1 bet you’ll payback $3. In terms of probability \\(P(A) = 1/3\\).\nOdds are primarily used in betting markets. For example, let’s re-analyze the 2016 election in the US.",

    "text": "Completeness axiom. This axiom assumes that a decision-maker can compare and rank all possible outcomes or acts in terms of preferences. In other words, for any two acts (or lotteries), the decision-maker can express a preference for one over the other, or consider them equally preferable.\nTransitivity axiom. This axiom states that if a decision-maker prefers act A to act B and prefers act B to act C, then they must also prefer act A to act C. It ensures that the preferences are consistent and do not lead to cycles or contradictions.\nContinuity axiom (Archimedean axiom). The continuity axiom introduces the concept of continuity in preferences. It implies that if a decision-maker prefers act A to act B, and B to C, then there exists some probability at which the decision-maker is indifferent between A and a lottery that combines B and C. This axiom helps to ensure that preferences are not too “discontinuous” or erratic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.1 (Odds) One of the main sources of prediction markets is bookmakers who take bets on outcomes of events (mostly sporting) at agreed upon odds. Figure 1.1 shows the odds used by several bookmakers to take bets on the winner of the US presidential election in 2016. At that time the market was predicting that Hillary Clinton would win over Donald Trump, the second favorite, with odds 7/3. The table is generated by the Oddschecker website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Presidential Odds 2016\n\n\n\nAhead of time we can assign probabilities of winning to each candidate. According to the bookmakers’ odds the candidate with highest chance to win is Hillary Clinton. The best odds on Clinton are \\(1/3\\), this means that you have to risk $3 to win $1 offered by Matchbook. Odds dynamically change as new information arrives. There is also competition between the Bookmakers and the Market is adapting to provide the best possible odds. Ladbrokes is the largest UK bookie and Betfair is an online exchange. A bookmaker sets their odds trying to get equal public action on both sides, otherwise they are risking to stay out of business.\n\n\nExample 1.2 (Kentucky Derby) The Kentucky Derby happens once a year – first Saturday in May. In horse racing the odds are set by the betting public. The racetrack collects all the bets, takes a fee (18%), and then redistributes the pool to the winning tickets. The race is \\(1 \\frac{1}{4}\\) miles (2 kilometers) and is the first time the three-year old horses have raced the distance.\nThere was a long period where favorites rarely won. Only six favorites have won in the 36 year period from 1979 to 2013. Recently favorites have won many times in a row. The market is getting better at predicting who’s going to win. Here’s the data\n\n\n\nHorse Name\nYear\nOdds\n\n\n\n\nSpectacular Bid\n1979\n0.6/1\n\n\nFusaichi Pegasus\n2000\n2.3/1\n\n\nStreet Sense\n2007\n9/2\n\n\nBig Brown\n2008\n5/2\n\n\n\nRecently, favorites have had a lot more success\n\n\n\nHorse Name\nYear\nOdds\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Chrome\n2014\n5/2\n\n\nAmerican Pharoah\n2015\n2/1\n\n\nNyquist\n2016\n3.3/1\n\n\nAlways Dreaming\n2017\n5.2/1\n\n\n\nThe most famous favorite to win is Secretariat (1973) who won with odds 3/2 in a record time of 1 minute 59 and 2/5 seconds. Monarchos was the only other horse that in 2001 has broken two minutes at odds 11.5/1.\n\n\nExample 1.3 (Exacta Betting and the Harville Formula) How can probability help you with betting on the race? There are many different types of bets, and probability can help you find fair odds. The Derby is a Grade 1 stakes race for three-year-old thoroughbred horses. Colts and geldings carry 126 pounds and fillies 121. The odds are set by pari-mutuel betting by the public. After all the wagers have been placed, the racetrack takes a fee (18%). After the winning horse passes the finishing line, the pool of money is redistributed to the winning tickets. Random betting therefore loses you 18%, so it’s important to learn some empirical facts to try and tilt the odds in your favor.\nFor example, you can place bets as follows:\n\nWin: “$2 win horse 1”\nStraight Exacta: “$2 exacta 1 with 2”\n\nExacta Box: “$2 exacta box 1 and 2” You win with either order: 2 bets = $4.\n\nConsider a hypothetical race where Sovereignty wins at 9/1 odds and Journalism comes second at 7/2 odds. For a $2 bet on Sovereignty to Win at 9/1, the payout would be \\(2 \\cdot 9 + 2 = \\$20\\) (the 9/1 win plus your initial $2 bet returned).\nLet’s figure out the fair value for an exacta bet given that you know the win odds. This is known as the Harville formula. The exacta is probably one of the most popular bets for many horseplayers, corresponding to predicting the first two horses in the correct order.\nThe Harville formula provides an answer. We use the rule of conditional probability. The probability for the straight exacta of horses \\(A\\) beating horse \\(B\\) is: \\[\nP(A \\text{ beats } B) = P(A \\text{ Wins}) \\cdot P(B \\text{ Second} \\mid A \\text{ Wins})\n\\]\nA reasonable assessment of \\(P(B \\text{ Second} \\mid A \\text{ Wins})\\) can be derived as follows. For horse \\(B\\) to come second, imagine taking horse \\(A\\) out of the betting pool and re-distributing the probability to \\(B\\). This gives: \\[\nP(B \\text{ Second} \\mid A \\text{ Wins}) = \\frac{P(B \\text{ Wins})}{1 - P(A \\text{ Wins})}\n\\]\nIn total, the fair price for the exacta is: \\[\nP(A \\text{ beats } B) = P(A \\text{ Wins}) \\cdot \\frac{P(B \\text{ Wins})}{1 - P(A \\text{ Wins})}\n\\]\nTherefore, we have: \\[\np_{12} = p_1 \\cdot \\frac{p_2}{1-p_1} \\text{ where } p_1 = \\frac{1}{1+O_1}, p_2 = \\frac{1}{1+O_2}\n\\]\nSolving for odds, we get the Harville formula: \\[\nO_{12} = O_1(1 + O_2) - 1\n\\]\nUsing our example with 9/1 and 7/2 odds: \\(O_{12} = 9 \\cdot (1 + 3.5) - 1 = 39.5/1\\).\nNotice that the actual payout is determined solely by the volume of money wagered on that combination. There’s no requirement it matches our probabilistic analysis. However, the Harville formula gives us an idea of fair value. Some bettors searching for value try to find significantly undervalued exacta bets relative to the Harville formula.\nThere are many other factors to consider: jockey performance, bloodlines, and post positions can all matter significantly in determining the actual race outcome.\n\n\nExample 1.4 (Boy-Girl Paradox) If a woman has two children and one is a girl, the chance that the other child is also female has to be \\(50-50\\), right? But it’s not. Let’s list the possibilities of girl-girl, girl-boy and boy-girl. So the chance that both children are girls is 33 percent. Once we are told that one child is female, this extra information constrains the odds. (Even weirder, and I’m still not sure I believe this, the author demonstrates that the odds change again if we’re told that one of the girls is named Florida.) In terms of conditional probability, the four possible combinations are \\[\nBB \\; \\; BG \\; \\; GB \\; \\; GG\n\\] Conditional on the information that one is a girl means that you know we can’t have the \\(BB\\) scenario. Hence we are left with three possibilities \\[\nBG \\; \\; GB \\; \\; GG\n\\] In one of these is the other a girl. Hence \\(1/3\\).\nIt’s a different question if we say that the first child is a girl. Then the probability that the other is a girl is \\(1/2\\) as there are two possibilities \\[\nGB \\; \\; GG\n\\] This leads to the probability of \\(1/2\\).\n\n\nExample 1.5 (Galton Paradox) You flip three fair coins. What is the \\(P(\\text{all} \\; \\text{alike})\\)?\nAssuming a fair coin (i.e. \\(p(H) = p(T) = 1/2\\)), a formal approach might consist of computing the probability for all heads or all tails, which is\n\\[\\begin{align*}\np(HHH) &\\equiv p(H \\text{ and } H \\text{ and } H) \\\\\n&= p(H)\\times p(H)\\times p(H) \\\\\n&= \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3\n\\end{align*}\\] and, since we’re ultimately interested in the probability of either (mutually exclusive) case, \\[\\begin{align*}\nP(\\text{all alike}) &= P(HHH \\text{ or } TTT) \\\\\n&= P(HHH) + P(TTT) \\\\\n&= 2 \\times \\frac{1}{8}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nOne could arrive at the same conclusion by enumerating the entire sample space and counting the events. Now, what about a simpler argument like the following. In a run of three coin flips, two coins will always share the same result, so the probability that the “remaining/last” coin matches the other two is 1/2; thus, \\[\np(\\text{all alike}) = 1/2\n\\] The fault lies somewhere within the terms “remaining/last” and their connotation. A faulty symmetry assumption is being made in that statement pertaining to the distribution of the “remaining/last” coin. Loosely put, you’re certain to ultimately be in the case where at least two are alike, as stated in the above argument, but within each case the probability of landing the “remaining/last” matching \\(H\\) or \\(T\\) is not \\(1/2\\), due to the variety of ways you can arrive at two matching coins.\nFor a real treatment of the subject, we highly recommend reading Galton’s essay at galton.org.\n\n\nExample 1.6 (Three Cards) Suppose that you have three cards: one red/red, one red/blue and one blue/blue. You randomly draw a card and place it face down on a table and then you reveal the top side. You see that it’s red. What’s the probability the other side is red? \\(1/2\\)? No, it’s \\(2/3\\)! By a similar logic there are six initial possibilities \\[\nB_1 B_2 \\; \\; B_2 B_1 \\; \\; B R \\; \\; R B \\; \\; R_1 R_2 \\; \\; R_2 R_1\n\\] where \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) index the sides of the same colored cards.\nIf we now condition on the top side being red we see that there are still three possibilities left \\[\nR B \\; \\; R_1 R_2 \\; \\; R_2 R_1\n\\] Hence the probability is \\(2/3\\) and not the intuitive \\(1/2\\).\n\n\nExample 1.7 (NFL: New England Patriots Coin Toss) Let’s consider another example and calculate the probability of winning 19 coin tosses out of 25. The NFL team New England Patriots won 19 out of 25 coin tosses in the 2014-15 season. What is the probability of this happening?\nLet \\(X\\) be a random variable equal to \\(1\\) if the Patriots win and \\(0\\) otherwise. It’s reasonable to assume \\(P(X = 1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\). The probability of observing the sequence in which there is 1 on the first 19 positions and 0 afterwards is \\((1/2)^{25}\\). We can code a typical sequence as, \\[\n1,1,1,\\ldots,1,0,0,\\ldots,0.\n\\] There are \\(177,100\\) different sequences of 25 games where the Patriots win 19. There are \\(25! = 1\\cdot 2\\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 25\\) ways to re-arrange this sequence of zeroes and ones. Further, all zeroes and ones are interchangeable and there are \\(19!\\) ways to re-arrange the ones and \\(6!\\) ways to rearrange the sequence of zeroes. Thus, the total number of different winning sequences is\n\nfactorial(25)/(factorial(19)*factorial(25-19))\n\n## [1] 177100\n\n\nEach potential sequence has probability \\(0.5^{25}\\), thus \\[\nP\\left(\\text{Patriots win 19 out of 25 tosses}\\right) =  177,100 \\times 0.5^{25} = 0.005\n\\]\nOften, it is easier to communicate uncertainties in the form of odds. In terms of betting odds of \\(1:1\\) gives \\(P = \\frac{1}{2}\\), odds of \\(2:1\\) (I give \\(2\\) for each \\(1\\) you bet) is \\(P = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\nRemember, odds, \\(O(A)\\), is the ratio of the probability of happening over not happening, \\[\nO(A) = (1 - P(A))/P(A),\n\\] equivalently, \\[\nP(A) = \\frac{1}{1 + O(A)}.\n\\]\nThe odds of the Patriots winning sequence are then 1 to 199\n\n0.005/(1-0.005)\n\n## [1] 0.005\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.8 (Hitting Streak) Pete Rose of the Cincinnati Reds set a National League record of hitting safely in \\(44\\) consecutive games. How likely is such a long sequence of safe hits to be observed? If you were a bookmaker, what odds would you offer on such an event? This means that he safely reached first base after hitting the ball into fair territory, without the benefit of an error or a fielder’s choice at least once in every one of those 44 games. Here are a couple of facts we know about him:\n\nRose was a \\(300\\) hitter, he hits safely 3 times out of 10 attempts\nEach at bat is assumed to be independent, i.e., the current at bat doesn’t affect the outcome of the next.\n\nAssuming he comes to bat \\(4\\) times each game, what probability might reasonably be associated with that hitting streak? First we define notation. We use \\(A_i\\) to denote an event of hitting safely at game \\(i\\), then \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& P( \\mathrm{Rose \\; Hits \\; Safely \\; in \\;44 \\; consecutive \\; games} ) = \\\\\n& P ( A_1 \\; \\text{and} \\;  A_2  \\ldots \\text{and} \\;  A_{44} ) = P ( A_1 ) P ( A_2 ) \\ldots P ( A_{44} )\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] We now need to find \\(P(A_i)\\)s where \\(P (A_i ) = 1 - P ( \\text{not} \\; A_i )\\) \\[\\begin{align*}\nP ( A_1 ) & = 1 - P ( \\mathrm{ not} \\; A_1 ) \\\\\n& = 1 - P ( \\mathrm{ Rose \\; makes \\; 4 \\; outs } ) \\\\\n& = 1 - ( 0.7)^4 = 0.76\n\\end{align*}\\] For the winning streak, then we have \\((0.76)^{44} = 0.0000057\\), a very low probability. In terms of odds, there are three basic inferences\n\nThis means that the odds for a particular player as good as Pete Rose starting a hitting streak today are \\(175,470\\) to \\(1\\).\nThis doesn’t mean that the run of \\(44\\) won’t be beaten by some player at some time: the Law of Very Large Numbers\nJoe DiMaggio’s record is 56. He is a 325 hitter, thus we have \\((0.792)^{56} = 2.13 \\times 10^{-6}\\) or 455,962 to 1. It’s going to be hard to beat.\n\n\n\nExample 1.9 (Derek Jeter) Sample averages can have paradoxical behavior. This is related to the field of causation and the property of confounding. Let’s compare Derek Jeter and David Justice batting averages. In both 1995 and 1996, Justice had a higher batting average than Jeter did. However, when you combine the two seasons, Jeter shows a higher batting average than Justice! This is just a property of averages and finer subset selection can change your average effects.\n\n\n\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\nCombined\n\n\n\n\n\nDerek Jeter\n12/48\n0.250\n183/582\n0.314\n195/630\n0.310\n\n\nDavid Justice\n104/411\n0.253\n45/140\n0.321\n149/551\n0.270\n\n\n\nThis situation is known as confounding. It occurs when two separate and different populations are aggregated to give misleading conclusions. The example shows that if \\(A,B,C\\) are events it is possible to have the three inequalities \\[\\begin{align*}\n&P( A \\mid B \\text{ and } C ) &gt; P( A \\mid B \\text{ and } \\bar C )\\\\\n&P( A \\mid \\bar  B \\text{ and } C ) &gt; P( A \\mid \\bar  B \\text{ and } \\bar  C )\\\\\n&P( A \\mid C ) &lt; P( A \\mid \\bar C )\n\\end{align*}\\] The three inequalities can’t hold simultaneously when \\(P(B\\mid C) = P(B\\mid \\bar  C)\\).\n\n\nExample 1.10 (Birthday Problem) The birthday problem (Diaconis and and Mosteller 1989) is a classic problem in probability theory that explores the counterintuitive likelihood of shared birthdays within a group. Surprisingly, in a room of 23 people, the probability of shared birthdays is 50%. With 70 people, the probability is 99.9%.\nIn general, given \\(N\\) items (people) randomly distributed into \\(c\\) categories (birthdays), where the number of items is small compared to the number of categories \\(N \\ll c\\), the probability of no match is given by \\[\nP(\\text{no match}) \\approx \\exp\\left(-N^2/2c\\right).\n\\] Given \\(A_i\\) is the event that person \\(i\\) has a matching birthday with someone, we have \\[\nP(\\text{no match})  = \\prod_{i=1}^{N-1}(1-P(A_i)) = \\exp\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\\log (1-P(A_i))\\right).\n\\] Here \\(P(A_i) =\\dfrac{i}{c}\\) Then use the approximation \\(\\log(1-x) \\approx -x\\) for small \\(x\\) to get \\(P(\\text{no match})\\). \\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\\log (1-P(A_i)) \\approx -\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\\dfrac{i}{c} = -\\dfrac{N(N-1)}{2c}.\n\\]\nThe probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is then the complement of the probability above: \\[\nP(\\text{At least one shared birthday}) = 1 - P(\\text{no match}).\n\\] Solving for \\(P(\\text{match})=1/2\\), leads to a square root law \\(N=1.2\\sqrt{c}\\), if \\(c=365\\) then \\(N=23\\), and if \\(c=121\\) (near birthday match), then \\(N=13\\).\nThe unintuitive nature of this result is a consequence of the fact that there are many potential pairs of people in the group, and the probability of at least one pair sharing a birthday increases quickly as more people are added. The birthday problem is often used to illustrate concepts in probability, combinatorics, and statistical reasoning. It’s a great example of how our intuitions about probabilities can be quite different from the actual mathematical probabilities.",

    "section": "1.2 Kolmogorov Axioms",
    "text": "1.2 Kolmogorov Axioms\nLater, in the early 1930s, Kolmogorov made significant contributions to the development of probability. He characterized it as a system of sets that meet specific criteria. The representation of the elements within this set is irrelevant. This is similar to how basic geometric concepts are typically introduced. For example, a circle is defined as the set of all points that are equidistant from a given point. The representation of the circle is irrelevant, as long as the set of points meets the criteria. Similarly, a probability field is defined as a set of events that meet specific criteria. This is the basis of the axiomatic approach to probability theory.\nKolmogorov’s axioms provided a rigorous foundation for probability theory. He showed that probability is immensely useful and adheres to only a few basic rules. These axioms provided a set of logical and mathematical rules that describe the properties of probability measures.\nLet \\(S\\) be a collection of elementary events and consider two random events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) that are subsets of \\(S\\). The three axioms are:\n\nNon-negativity: For any random event \\(A\\), the probability of \\(A\\) is greater than or equal to zero: \\[\nP(A)\\ge 0\n\\]\nNormalization: The probability of the entire sample space \\(S\\) is equal to 1: \\[\nP(S) = 1\n\\]\nAdditivity: For mutually exclusive events, we have \\[\nP(A \\text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)\n\\] The probability of the union of these events is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities.\n\nMutually exclusive means that only one of the events in the sequence can occur. These axioms provided a solid and consistent foundation for probability theory, allowing mathematicians to reason rigorously about uncertainty and randomness. Kolmogorov’s work helped unify and clarify many concepts in probability, and his axioms are now widely accepted as the basis for modern probability theory. His contributions had a profound impact on various fields, including statistics, mathematical physics, and information theory.\nAssigning probabilities to events is a challenging problem. Often, the probability will be applied to analyze results of experiments (observed data). Consider the coin-tossing example. We toss a coin twice and the possible outcomes are HH, HT, TH, TT. Say event \\(A\\) represents a repetition, then it will consist of the first and second outcome of the two coin-tosses. Then, to empirically estimate \\(P(A)\\) we can repeat the two-toss experiment \\(n\\) times and count \\(m\\), the number of times \\(A\\) occurred. When \\(N\\) is large, \\(m/N\\) will be close to \\(P(A)\\). However, if we are to repeat this experiment under different conditions, e.g. when an unbalanced coin is used, our estimate of \\(P(A)\\) will change as well.\nThe axioms provide a number of rules that probabilities must follow. There are several important corollaries that can help us assign probabilities to events. Here are some important corollaries that follow from the Kolmogorov axioms:\n\n\nComplement rule: Let “not \\(A\\)” denote the complement of event \\(A\\). \\[\n  P(\\text{not } A) = 1- P(A).\n\\]\nMonotonicity: If \\(A\\subset B\\), then \\(P(A)\\le P(B)\\). In other words, the probability of a larger set is greater than or equal to the probability of a subset.\nSubadditivity: This is a generalization of the addition rule, where the equality holds when events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are mutually exclusive. \\[\nP(A \\text{ or } B)\\le P(A)+P(B).\n\\]\nInclusion–exclusion principle: This principle extends subadditivity to the case where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are not necessarily mutually exclusive. \\[\nP(A\\text{ or } B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\\text{ and }B).\n\\]\nConditional probability: The conditional probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\) is \\[\nP(A\\mid B) = \\dfrac{P(A \\text{ and } B)}{P(B)}.\n\\]\nBayes rule simply reverses the conditioning to compute \\(P(A\\mid B)\\) from \\(P(B\\mid A)\\)—a disciplined probability accounting. \\[\nP(A\\mid B) = \\dfrac{P(B\\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}.   \n\\]\nLaw of total probability is a direct consequence of the definition of conditional probability and the normalization axiom. It states that if \\(B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_n\\) are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events, then \\[\nP(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^n P(A \\text{ and } B_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n P(A \\mid B_i)P(B_i).\n\\]\n\nAll of these axioms follow simply from the principle of coherence and the avoidance of Dutch book arbitrage. This includes the Bayes rule itself (de Finetti, Shimony).\nBayes rule is a fundamental rule of probability that allows us to calculate conditional probabilities. It is a direct consequence of the definition of conditional probability and the normalization axiom. This rule will become central to learning and inference in artificial intelligence.\nBayes rule simply provides a disciplined probability accounting of how probabilities get updated in light of evidence. A rational agent requires that their subjective probabilities must obey the principle of coherence. Namely in announcing the set of probabilities he cannot undergo a sure loss. Interestingly enough, this is enough to provide a similar framework to the axiomatic approach of Kolmogorov.\nThese corollaries and principles help in deriving further results and provide additional tools for analyzing and understanding probability and random processes based on the fundamental principles laid out by Kolmogorov. Arguably the most important rule is Bayes rule for conditional probability.\nThe age of artificial intelligence (AI) has certainly proved that Bayes is a powerful tool. One of the key properties of probabilities is that they are updated as you learn new information. Conditional means given its personal characteristics or the personal situation. Personalization algorithms used by many online services rely on this concept. One can argue that all probabilities are conditional in some way. The process of Bayesian updating is central to how machines learn from observed data. Rational human behavior ought to adhere to Bayes rule, although there is much literature documenting the contrary.",

    "section": "1.3 Dutch book and the rules of probability",
    "text": "1.3 Dutch book and the rules of probability\nIf probabilities are degrees of belief and subjective, where do they come from and what rules must they satisfy? These questions were answered to varying degrees by Ramsey, de Finetti, and Savage. Ramsey and de Finetti, working independently and at roughly the same time, developed the first primitive theories of subjective probability and expected utility, and Savage placed the theories on a more rigorous footing, combining the insights of Ramsey with the expected utility theory of von Neumann and Morgenstern.\nThe starting point for Ramsey’s and de Finetti’s theories is the measurement of one’s subjective probabilities using betting odds, which have been used for centuries to gauge the uncertainty over an event. As noted by de Finetti, “It is a question of simply making mathematically precise the trivial and obvious idea that the degree of probability attributed by an individual to a given event is revealed by the conditions under which he would be disposed to bet on that event” (p. 101). Notice the difference between the frequentist and Bayesian approach. Instead of defining the probabilities via an infinite repeated experiment, the Bayesian approach elicits probabilities from an individual’s observed behavior.\nFormally, for any event \\(A\\), the identity \\[\nP(A)  =\\frac{1}{1+\\text{odds}(A)}\\text{ or }\\text{odds}(A)=\\frac{1-P(A)}{P(A)},\n\\] where \\(\\bar A\\) is the complement of \\(A\\), links odds and probabilities. Throughout, we use \\(P\\) as a generic term to denote probabilities, when there is no specific reference to an underlying distribution or density. If a horse in a race has odds of 2, commonly expressed as 2:1 (read two to one), then the probability the horse wins is \\(1/3\\). The basic idea of using betting odds to elicit probabilities is simple and intuitive: ask an individual to place odds over various mutually exclusive events, and use these odds to calculate the probabilities. Odds are fair if lower odds would induce a person to take the bet and higher odds would induce the person to take the other side of the bet.\nIn constructing a collection of betting odds over various events, de Finetti and Ramsey argued that not all odds are rational (i.e., consistent or coherent). For example, the sum of the probability of each horse winning a race cannot be greater than one. If a person has inconsistent beliefs, then he “could have a book made against him by a cunning bettor and would then stand to lose in any event” (Ramsey (1931), p. 22). This situation is called a Dutch book arbitrage, and a rational theory of probability should rule out such inconsistencies. By avoiding Dutch books, Ramsey and de Finetti showed that the degrees of beliefs elicited from coherent odds satisfy the standard axioms of probability theory, such as the restriction that probabilities are between zero and one, finite additivity, and the laws of conditional probability. The converse also holds: probabilities satisfying the standard axioms generate odds excluding Dutch-book arbitrages. Absence of arbitrage is natural in finance and economics and is a primary assumption for many foundational results in asset pricing. In fact, the derivations given below have a similar flavor to those used to prove the existence of a state price density assuming discrete states.\nDutch-book arguments are simple to explain. To start, they require an individual to post odds over events. A bettor or bookie can then post stakes or make bets at those odds with a given payoff, \\(S\\). The choice of the stakes is up to the bettor. A Dutch book occurs when a cunning bettor makes money for sure by placing carefully chosen stakes at the given odds. Alternatively, one can view the odds as prices of lottery tickets that pay off $1 when the event occurs, and the stakes as the number of tickets bought. Thus, probabilities are essentially lottery ticket prices. In fact, de Finetti used the notation ‘Pr’ to refer to both prices and probabilities.\nTo derive the rules, consider the first axiom of probability: for any event \\(A\\), \\(0\\leq P(A) \\leq 1\\). Suppose that the odds imply probabilities \\(P(A)\\) for \\(A\\) occurring and \\(P(\\bar A)\\) for other outcomes, with associated payoffs of \\(S_{A}\\) and \\(S_{\\bar A}\\). Then, having bet \\(S_{A}\\) and \\(S_{\\bar A}\\), the gains if \\(A\\) or \\(\\bar A\\) occur, \\(G_{A}\\) and \\(G_{\\bar A}\\), respectively, are \\[\\begin{align*}\nG(A)   &  =S_{A}-P(A) S_{A}-P(\\bar A)  S_{\\bar A}\\\\\nG(\\bar A)   &  =S_{\\bar A}-P(A) S_{A}-P(\\bar A)  S_{\\bar A}.\n\\end{align*}\\] To see this, note that the bettor receives \\(S_{A}\\) and pays \\(P(A) S_{A}\\) for a bet on event \\(A\\). The bookie can always choose to place a zero stake on \\(\\bar A\\) occurring, which implies that \\(G(A) =S_{A}-P(A) S_{A}\\) and \\(G\\left(\\bar A\\right) =-P(A) S_{A}\\). Coherence or the absence of arbitrage implies that you cannot gain or lose in both states, thus \\(G(A) G(\\bar A) \\leq 0\\). Substituting, \\(\\left( 1-P(A) \\right) P(A) \\geq0\\) or \\(0\\leq P(A) \\leq 1\\), which is the first axiom of probability. The second axiom, that the set of all possible outcomes has probability \\(1\\), is similarly straightforward to show.\nThe third axiom is that probabilities add, that is, for two disjoint events \\(A_{1}\\) and \\(A_{2}\\), \\(P(A) =P\\left( A_{1} \\text{ or } A_{2}\\right) =P\\left( A_{1}\\right) +P\\left( A_{2}\\right)\\). Assuming stakes sizes of \\(S_{A}\\), \\(S_{A_{1}},\\) and \\(S_{A_{2}}\\) (and zero stakes on their complements) there are three possible outcomes. If neither \\(A_{1}\\) nor \\(A_{2}\\) occur, the gain is \\[\nG(\\bar A)  =-P(A)  S_{A} -P\\left(  A_{1}\\right)  S_{A_{1}}-P\\left( A_{2}\\right)  S_{A_{2}}.\n\\]\nIf \\(A_{1}\\) occurs, \\(A\\) also occurs, and the gain is \\[\nG\\left(  A_{1}\\right)  =\\left(  1-P(A) \\right)  S_{A}+\\left(  1-P\\left(  A_{1}\\right)  \\right) S_{A_{1}}-P\\left(  A_{2}\\right)  S_{A_{2}},\n\\] and finally if \\(A_{2}\\) occurs, \\(A\\) also occurs, and \\[\nG\\left(  A_{2}\\right)  =\\left(  1-P(A) \\right)  S_{A}-P\\left(  A_{1}\\right)  S_{A_{1}}+\\left( 1-P\\left(  A_{2}\\right)  \\right)  S_{A_{2}}.\n\\] Arranging these into a matrix equation, \\(G=PS\\): \\[\n\\left( \\begin{array}\n[c]{c}%\nG(\\bar A) \\\\\nG\\left(  A_{1}\\right) \\\\\nG\\left(  A_{2}\\right)\n\\end{array}\n\\right)  =\\left( \\begin{array}\n[c]{ccc}%\n-P(A)  & -P\\left(  A_{1}\\right)  &\n-P\\left(  A_{2}\\right) \\\\\n1-P(A)  & 1-P\\left(  A_{1}\\right)  &\n-P\\left(  A_{2}\\right) \\\\\n1-P(A)  & -P\\left(  A_{1}\\right)  &\n1-P\\left(  A_{2}\\right)\n\\end{array}\n\\right)  \\left( \\begin{array}\n[c]{c}%\nS_{A}\\\\\nS_{A_{1}}\\\\\nS_{A_{2}}%\n\\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\]\nThe absence of a Dutch book arbitrage implies that there is no set of stakes, \\(S_{A}\\), \\(S_{A_{1}}\\), and \\(S_{A_{2}}\\), such that the winnings in all three events are positive. If the matrix \\(P\\) is invertible, it is possible to find stakes with positive gains. To rule this out, the determinant of \\(P\\) must be zero, which implies that \\(0=-P(A) +P\\left(A_{1}\\right) +P\\left( A_{2}\\right)\\), or \\(P\\left(A\\right) =P\\left( A_{1}\\right) +P\\left( A_{2}\\right)\\).\nThe fourth axiom is conditional probability. Consider an event \\(B\\), with \\(P\\left( B\\right) &gt;0\\), an event \\(A\\) that occurs conditional on \\(B\\), and the event that both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) occur. The probabilities or prices of these bets are \\(P\\left( B\\right)\\), \\(P\\left( A \\mid B\\right)\\), and \\(P\\left( A \\text{ and } B\\right)\\). Consider bets with stakes \\(S_{B}\\), \\(S_{A \\mid B}\\) and \\(S_{A \\text{ and } B}\\), with the understanding that if \\(B\\) does not occur, the conditional bet on \\(A\\) is canceled. The payoffs to the events that \\(B\\) does not occur, \\(B\\) occurs but not \\(A\\), and \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) occur, are \\[\n\\left( \\begin{array}\n[c]{c}%\nG\\left(  \\bar B\\right) \\\\\nG\\left(  \\bar A \\text{ and } B\\right) \\\\\nG\\left(  A \\text{ and } B\\right)\n\\end{array}\n\\right)  =\\left( \\begin{array}\n[c]{ccc}%\n-P\\left(  B\\right)  & -P\\left(  A \\text{ and } B\\right)  & 0\\\\\n1-P\\left(  B\\right)  & -P\\left(  A \\text{ and } B\\right)  &\n-P\\left(  A \\mid B\\right) \\\\\n1-P\\left(  B\\right)  & 1-P\\left(  A \\text{ and } B\\right)  &\n1-P\\left(  A \\mid B\\right)\n\\end{array}\n\\right)  \\left( \\begin{array}\n[c]{c}%\nS_{B}\\\\\nS_{A \\text{ and } B}\\\\\nS_{A \\mid B}%\n\\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\] Similar arguments imply the determinant must be zero, which implies that \\[\nP\\left(  A \\mid B\\right)  =\\frac{P\\left(  A \\text{ and } B\\right) }{P\\left(  B\\right)  },\n\\] which is the law of conditional probability, given \\(P(B)&gt;0\\), of course, otherwise the conditional probability is not defined, and the \\(P\\) matrix has determinant 0.\nTo summarize, probabilities are degrees of belief and are subjective, and if these beliefs are consistent or coherent, they satisfy the rules of probability. Thus, unlike the Kolmogorov system that assumes the laws of probability, the Bayesian approach derives the laws of probability from behavior that avoids certain losses. This is why most Bayesians describe their way of thinking as rational and coherent.",

    "text": "1.4 Random Variables\nA random variable is a function that maps the outcomes of a random experiment (events) to real numbers. It essentially assigns a numerical value to each outcome in the sample space of a random experiment. In other words, a random variable provides a bridge between the abstract concept of events in a sample space and the concrete calculations involving numerical values and probabilities. Similar to assigning probabilities to events, we can assign respective probabilities to random variables.\nFor example, consider a random experiment of rolling a die. Here, an event could be “the outcome is an even number”, and the random variable could be the actual number that shows up on the die. The probability of the event “the outcome is an even number” is 0.5, and the probability distribution of the random variable is a list of all numbers from 1 to 6 each with a probability of 1/6.\nWhile events and random variables are distinct concepts, they are closely related through the framework of probability theory, with random variables serving as a key tool for calculating and working with probabilities of events.\nRandom variables are quantities that we are not certain about. A random variable that can take a finite or a countable number of values is called a discrete random variable (number of rainy days next week). Otherwise, it will be a continuous random variable (amount of rain tomorrow).\nDiscrete random variables are often constructed by assigning specific values to events such as \\(\\{X=x\\}\\) which corresponds to the outcomes where \\(X\\) equals a specific number \\(x\\). For example\n\nWill a user click-through on a Google ad? (0 or 1)\nWho will win the 2024 elections? (Trump=1, Biden=2, Independent=3)\n\nTo fix notation, we will use \\(\\prob{X=x}\\) to denote the probability that random variable \\(X\\) is equal to \\(x\\). A map from all possible values \\(x\\) of a discrete random variable \\(X\\) to probabilities is called a probability mass function \\(p(x)\\). We will interchangeably use \\(\\prob{X=x}\\) and \\(p(x)\\). An important property of the probability mass function is that (normalization Kolmogorov axiom) \\[\n\\sum_{x\\in S} p(x) = 1.\n\\] Here \\(S\\) denotes the set of all possible values of random variable \\(X\\).\nClearly, all probabilities have to be greater than or equal to zero, so that \\(p(x)\\ge 0\\).\nFor a continuous random variable, the probability distribution is represented by a probability density function (PDF) \\(p(x)\\), which indicates the likelihood of the variable taking a specific value. Then to calculate probability of a variable falling within a particular range \\(a \\leq X \\leq b\\) we need to integrate the PDF over the range: \\[\n\\prob{a \\leq X \\leq b} = \\int_a^b p(x) dx.\n\\] Often, we are interested in \\(F(x) = P(X\\le x)\\), this is the cumulative distribution function (CDF).\nThe Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for a discrete random variable is a function that provides the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to a particular value. The CDF is a monotonically increasing function (never decreases as \\(x\\) increases). In other words, if \\(a \\leq b\\), then \\(F_X(a) \\leq F_X(b)\\). The value of the CDF always lies between 0 and 1, inclusive.\n\nExample 1.11 (Discrete CDF) Suppose \\(X\\) is a discrete random variable that represents the outcome of rolling a six-sided die. The probability mass function (PMF) of \\(X\\) is:\n\\[\nP(X = x) = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\] for \\(x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\)\nThe CDF of \\(X\\), \\(F(x)\\), is calculated as follows:\n\nFor \\(x &lt; 1\\), \\(F(x) = 0\\) (since it’s impossible to roll less than 1).\nFor \\(1 \\leq x &lt; 2\\), \\(F(x) = \\frac{1}{6}\\) (the probability of rolling a 1).\nFor \\(2 \\leq x &lt; 3\\), \\(F(x) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{6}\\) (the probability of rolling a 1 or 2).\nThis pattern continues, adding \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) for each integer interval up to 6.\nFor \\(x \\geq 6\\), \\(F(x) = 1\\) (since it’s certain to roll a number 6 or less).\n\nGraphically, the CDF of a discrete random variable is a step function that increases at the value of each possible outcome. It’s flat between these outcomes because a discrete random variable can only take specific, distinct values.\n\nplot(ecdf(1:6), main=\"\")\n\n\n\n\nCDF of a discrete random variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Random Variables\nIf we want to build a probabilistic model of a stock price or return, we need to use a continuous random variable that can take an interval of values. Instead of a frequency function we will use a density function, \\(p(x)\\) to describe a continuous variable. Unlike the discrete case, \\(p(x)\\) is not the probability that the random variable takes value \\(x\\). Rather, we need to talk about the value being inside an interval. For example, the probability of \\(X\\) with density \\(p(x)\\) being inside any interval \\([a,b]\\), with \\(a&lt;b\\) is given by \\[\nP(a &lt; X &lt; b) = \\int_{a}^{b}p(x)dx.\n\\] The total probability is one as \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty p(x) dx=1\\). The simplest continuous random variable is the uniform. A uniform distribution describes a variable which takes on any value as likely as any other. For example, if you are asked about what would be the temperature in Chicago on July 4 of next year, you might say anywhere between 20 and 30 C. The density function of the corresponding uniform distribution is then \\[\n  p(x) = \\begin{cases} 1/10, ~~~20 \\le x \\le 30\\\\0, ~~~\\mbox{otherwise}\\end{cases}\n\\]\nUnder this model, the probability of temperature being between 25 and 27 degrees is \\[\nP(25 \\le x \\le 27) = \\int_{25}^{27} p(x)dx = (27-25)/10 = 0.2\n\\]\n\n\n\nUniform Distribution: Probability of temperature being between 25 and 27\n\n\nThe Cumulative Distribution Function for a random variable \\(X\\), denoted as \\(F_X(x)\\). For a continuous random variable, it is defined similarly to discrete RV CDF as \\[\nF(x) = P(X \\leq x)\n\\] It is a non-decreasing function and takes values in [0,1].\n\nExample 1.12 (Continuous CDF for Uniform Distribution) \\[\np(x) = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } 0 \\leq x \\leq 1 \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe CDF, \\(F(x)\\), is obtained by integrating the PDF:\n\nFor \\(x &lt; 0\\), \\(F(x) = 0\\).\nFor \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 1\\), \\(F(x) = \\int_0^x 1 \\, dt = x\\).\nFor \\(x &gt; 1\\), \\(F(x) = 1\\).\n\nSo, the CDF of this uniform distribution is a linear function that increases from 0 to 1 as \\(x\\) goes from 0 to 1.\nGraphically, the CDF of a continuous random variable is a smooth curve. It starts at 0, increases as \\(x\\) increases, and eventually reaches 1. The exact shape of the curve depends on the distribution of the variable, but the smooth, non-decreasing nature is a common feature. Figure below shows the CDF of a uniform and normal random variable, respectively.\nplot(ecdf(runif(500)), main=\"\", col=\"lightblue\", pch=21, bg=\"grey\")\nplot(ecdf(rnorm(500)), main=\"\", col=\"lightblue\", pch=21, bg=\"grey\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDF of a uniform random variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDF of a normal random variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Inverse CDF Method\nThe inverse distribution method uses samples of uniform random variables to generate draws from random variables with a continuous distribution function, \\(F\\). Since \\(F\\left(  x\\right)\\) is uniformly distributed on \\(\\left[ 0,1\\right]\\), draw a uniform random variable and invert the CDF to get a draw from \\(F\\). Thus, to sample from \\(F\\), \\[\\begin{align*}\n&  \\text{Step 1}\\text{: Draw }U\\sim U\\left[  0,1\\right]  \\ \\\\\n&  \\text{Step 2}\\text{: }\\text{Set }X=F^{-1}\\left(  U\\right)  ,\n\\end{align*}\\] where \\(F^{-1}\\left(  U\\right)  =\\inf\\left\\{  x:F\\left(  x\\right)  =U\\right\\}\\).\nThis inversion method provides i.i.d. draws from \\(F\\) provided that \\(F^{-1}\\left(  U\\right)\\) can be exactly calculated. For example, the CDF of an exponential random variable with parameter \\(\\mu\\) is \\(F\\left(  x\\right) =1-\\exp\\left(  -\\mu x\\right)\\), which can easily be inverted. When \\(F^{-1}\\) cannot be analytically calculated, approximate inversions can be used. For example, suppose that the density is a known analytical function. Then, \\(F\\left(  x\\right)\\) can be computed to an arbitrary degree of accuracy on a grid and inversions can be approximately calculated, generating an approximate draw from \\(F\\). With all approximations, there is a natural trade-off between computational speed and accuracy. One example where efficient approximations are possible are inversions involving normal distributions, which is useful for generating truncated normal random variables. Outside of these limited cases, the inverse transform method does not provide a computationally attractive approach for drawing random variables from a given distribution function. In particular, it does not work well in multiple dimensions.\n\n\nFunctional Transformations\nThe second main method uses functional transformations to express the distribution of a random variable that is a known function of another random variable. Suppose that \\(X\\sim F\\), admitting a density \\(f\\), and that \\(y=h\\left(  x\\right)\\) is an increasing continuous function. Thus, we can define \\(x=h^{-1}\\left(  y\\right)\\) as the inverse of the function \\(h\\). The distribution of \\(y\\) is given by \\[\nF_Y\\left(y\\right)  =\\text{P}\\left(  Y\\leq y\\right)  =\\int_{-\\infty}^{h^{-1}\\left(  y\\right)  }f\\left(  x\\right)  dx=F_X\\left(  X\\leq h^{-1}\\left(y\\right)  \\right).\n\\] Differentiating with respect to \\(y\\) gives the density via Leibnitz’s rule: \\[\nf_{Y}\\left(  y\\right)  =f\\left(  h^{-1}\\left(  y\\right)  \\right)  \\left\\vert\\frac{d}{dy}\\left(  h^{-1}\\left(  y\\right)  \\right)  \\right\\vert,\n\\] where we make explicit that the density is over the random variable \\(Y\\). This result is used widely. For example, if \\(X\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(  0,1\\right)\\), then \\(Y=\\mu+\\sigma X\\). Since \\(x=h^{-1}\\left(  y\\right)  =\\frac{y-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\), the distribution function is \\(F\\left(  \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)\\) and density \\[\nf_{Y}\\left(  y\\right)  =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}\\exp\\left(  -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(  \\frac{y-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)  ^{2}\\right).\n\\] Transformations are widely used to simulate both univariate and multivariate random variables. As examples, if \\(Y\\sim\\mathcal{X}^{2}\\left(  \\nu\\right)\\) and \\(\\nu\\) is an integer, then \\(Y=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\nu}X_{i}^{2}\\) where each \\(X_{i}\\) is independent standard normal. Exponential random variables can be used to simulate \\(\\mathcal{X}^{2}\\), Gamma, Beta, and Poisson random variables. The famous Box-Muller algorithm simulates normals from uniform and exponential random variables. In the multivariate setting, Wishart (and inverse Wishart) random variables can be simulated via sums of squared vectors of standard normal random variables.",

    "text": "1.5 Expectation and Variance (Reward and Risk)\nAn expected value of a random variable, denoted by \\(\\E{X}\\) is a weighted average. Each possible value of a random variable is weighted by its probability. For example, Google Maps uses expected value when calculating travel times. We might compute two different routes by their expected travel time. Typically, a forecast or expected value is all that is required — these expected values can be updated in real time as we travel. Say I am interested in travel time from Washington National airport to Fairfax in Virginia. The histogram below shows the travel times observed for a work day evening and were obtained from Uber.\n\nExample 1.13 (Uber) Let’s look at the histogram of travel times from Fairfax, VA to Washington, DC\n\nd = read.csv(\"../data/dc_travel_time.csv\") \n# use evening travel times (column 18) and convert from seconds to minutes \nevening_tt = d[,18]/60; day_tt = d[,15]/60; \nevening_tt = evening_tt[!is.na(evening_tt)] # remove missing observations \nhist(evening_tt, freq = F,main=\"\", xlab=\"Travel Time [min]\", nclass=20, col=\"lightblue\")\n\n\n\n\nTravel times in the evening\n\n\n\n\nFrom this dataset, we can empirically estimate the probabilities of observing different values of travel times\n\nbins = hist(evening_tt, breaks = 3, plot = F) \nknitr::kable(data.frame(\"tt\" = bins$mids, \"Probability\" = bins$counts/length(evening_tt)),col.names = c(\"Travel Time\",\"Probability\"),digits=2)\n\n\n\n\nTravel Time\nProbability\n\n\n\n\n18\n0.05\n\n\n22\n0.77\n\n\n28\n0.18\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a small chance (5%) I can get to Washington, DC in 18 minutes, which probably happens on a holiday and a non-trivial chance (18%) to travel for 28 minutes, possibly due to a sports game or bad weather. Most of the time (77%) our travel time is 22 minutes. However, when Uber shows you the travel time, it uses the expected value as a forecast rather than the full distribution. Specifically, you will be given an expected travel time of 23 minutes.\n\n0.05*18 + 0.77*22 + 0.18*28\n\n## [1] 23\n\n\nIt is a simple summary that takes into account travel accidents and other events that can affect travel time as best as it can.\n\nThe expected value \\(\\E{X}\\) of discrete random variable \\(X\\) which takes possible values \\(\\{x_1,\\ldots x_n\\}\\) is calculated using\n\\[\n\\E{X} =\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i\\prob{X = x_i}\n\\]\nFor example, in a binary scenario, if \\(X\\in \\{0,1\\}\\) and \\(P(X=1)=p\\), then \\(\\E{X} = 0\\times(1-p)+1\\times p = p\\). The expected value of a Bernoulli random variable is simply the probability of success. In many binary scenarios, a probabilistic forecast is sufficient.\nIf \\(X\\) is continuous with probability distribution \\(p(x)\\), then we have to calculate the expectation as an integral \\[\n\\E{X} = \\int xp(x)d x  \\text{ and } \\int p(x)dx = 1.\n\\] When you have a random variable \\(x\\) that has a support that is non-negative (that is, the variable has nonzero density/probability for only positive values), you can use the following property: \\[\n\\E{X} = \\int_0^\\infty \\left( 1 - F(x) \\right) \\,\\mathrm{d}x,\n\\] where \\(F(x)\\) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of \\(X\\). The proof is as follows: \\[\n\\E{X} = \\int_0^\\infty \\left( 1 - F(x) \\right) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_0^\\infty \\int_x^\\infty f(y) \\,\\mathrm{d}y \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_0^\\infty \\int_0^y \\,\\mathrm{d}x f(y) \\,\\mathrm{d}y = \\int_0^\\infty y f(y) \\,\\mathrm{d}y,\n\\] where \\(f(x)\\) is the probability density function (PDF) of \\(X\\).\nThere are cases, when the expectation does not exist. For example for a Cauchy distribution, the integral diverges, the area under the curve is infinite. In such cases, we say the expectation is undefined.\nWe can also calculate the expectation in terms of the quantile function (inverse CDF). \\[\n\\E{X} = \\int_{0}^1 F^{-1}(p) \\,\\mathrm{d}p,\n\\] where \\(F^{-1}(p) = \\inf\\{y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid F(y)\\ge p\\}\\) is the inverse CDF of \\(X\\). The proof is as follows: \\[\n\\E{X} = \\int_{0}^1 F^{-1}(p) \\,\\mathrm{d}p = \\int_{0}^1 \\int_{-\\infty}^{F^{-1}(p)} f(x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x \\,\\mathrm{d}p = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{0}^{F(x)} \\,\\mathrm{d}p f(x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x f(x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x.\n\\] We will use this result later when we discuss quantile neural networks.\n\nStandard Deviation and Covariance\nVariance measures the spread of a random variable around its expected value \\[\n\\Var{X} = \\E{(X-\\E{X})^2} =  \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\\mu)^2 \\prob{X=x_i}.\n\\] In the continuous case, we have \\[\n\\Var{X} = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty (x-\\mu) ^2 p(x)dx,\n\\] where \\(\\mu = \\mathbb{E}(X)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}p_X(x)dx\\). The standard deviation is more convenient and is the square root of variance \\(\\sd{X} = \\sqrt{\\Var{X}}\\). Standard deviation has the desirable property that it is measured in the same units as the random variable \\(X\\) itself and is a more useful measure.\nSuppose that we have two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). We need to measure whether they move together or in opposite directions. The covariance is defined by \\[\n\\Cov{X,Y} = \\E{\\left[ (X- \\E{X})(Y- \\E{Y})\\right]}.\n\\]\nWhen \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are discrete and we are given the joint probability distribution, we need to calculate \\[\n\\Cov{X,Y} = \\sum_{x,y}  ( x - \\E{X} )(y - \\E{Y})p(x,y).\n\\] Covariance is measured in units of \\(X\\times\\)units of \\(Y\\). This can be inconvenient and makes it hard to compare covariances of different pairs of variables. A more convenient metric is the correlation, which is defined by \\[\n\\Cor{X,Y}= \\frac{ \\Cov{X,Y} }{ \\sd{X} \\sd{Y} }.\n\\] Correlation, \\(\\Cor{X,Y}\\), is unitless and takes values between -1 and 1.\nIn the case of joint continuous distribution it is convenient to use the covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\) which is defined as \\[\n\\Sigma = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\Var{X} & \\Cov{X,Y} \\\\\n\\Cov{X,Y} & \\Var{Y}\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\] If \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent, then \\(\\Cov{X,Y} = 0\\) and \\(\\Sigma\\) is diagonal. The correlation matrix is defined as \\[\n\\rho = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & \\Cor{X,Y} \\\\\n\\Cor{X,Y} & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\] If \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) have an exact linear relationship, then \\(\\Cor{X,Y} = 1\\) and \\(\\Cov{X,Y}\\) is the product of standard deviations. In matrix notation, the relation between the covariance matrix and correlation matrix is given by \\[\n\\rho = \\mathrm{diag}\\left(\\Sigma\\right)^{-1/2} \\Sigma\\mathrm{diag}\\left(\\Sigma\\right)^{-1/2},\n\\] where \\(\\Sigma\\) is a diagonal matrix with standard deviations on the diagonal.\n\n\nPortfolios: linear combinations\nCalculating means and standard deviations of combinations of random variables is a central tool in probability. It is known as the portfolio problem. Let \\(P\\) be your portfolio, which comprises a mix of two assets \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), typically stocks and bonds, \\[\nP = aX + bY,\n\\] where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the portfolio weights, typically \\(a+b=1\\), as we are allocating our total capital. Imagine that you have placed \\(a\\) dollars on the random outcome \\(X\\), and \\(b\\) dollars on \\(Y\\). The portfolio \\(P\\) measures your total weighted outcome.\nKey portfolio rules: The expected value and variance follow the relations \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\E{aX + bY} = &      a\\E{X}+b\\E{Y}\\\\\n\\Var{ aX + bY }  = & a^2 \\Var{X} + b^2 \\Var{Y} + 2 ab \\Cov{X,Y },\n\\end{align*}\\] with covariance defined by \\[\n\\Cov{X,Y} = \\E{ ( X- \\E{X} )(Y- \\E{Y})}.\n\\] Expectation and variance help us to understand the long-run behavior. When we make long-term decisions, we need to use the expectations to avoid biases.\nThe covariance is related to the correlation by \\(\\Cov{X,Y} = \\text{Corr}(X, Y) \\cdot \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(X) \\cdot \\text{Var}(Y)}\\).\n\nExample 1.14 (Tortoise and Hare) Tortoise and Hare are selling cars. Say \\(X\\) is the number of cars sold and probability distributions, means and variances are given by the following table\n\n\n\n\n\\(X\\)\n\n\n\nMean\nVariance\nsd\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n\\(\\E{X}\\)\n\\(\\Var{X}\\)\n\\(\\sqrt{\\Var{X}}\\)\n\n\nTortoise\n0\n0.5\n0.5\n0\n1.5\n0.25\n0.5\n\n\nHare\n0.5\n0\n0\n0.5\n1.5\n2.25\n1.5\n\n\n\nLet’s calculate Tortoise’s expectations and variances \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\E{T} & = (1/2) (1) + (1/2)(2) = 1.5 \\\\\n\\Var{T} & = \\E{T^2} - \\E{T}^2 \\\\\n& =  (1/2)(1)^2 + (1/2)(2)^2 - (1.5)^2 = 0.25\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNow the Hare’s \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\E{H} & = (1/2)(0) + (1/2)(3) = 1.5 \\\\\n\\Var{H} & =  (1/2)(0)^2 + (1/2)(3)^2- (1.5)^2 = 2.25\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWhat do these tell us about the long run behavior?\n\nTortoise and Hare have the same expected number of cars sold.\nTortoise is more predictable than Hare. He has a smaller variance.\n\nThe standard deviations \\(\\sqrt{\\Var{X}}\\) are \\(0.5\\) and \\(1.5\\), respectively. Given two equal means, you always want to pick the lower variance. If we are to invest in one of those, we prefer Tortoise.\nWhat about a portfolio of Tortoise and Hare? Suppose I want to evenly split my investment between Tortoise and Hare. What is the expected number of cars sold and the variance of the number of cars sold? \\[\n\\E{\\frac{1}{2}T + \\frac{1}{2}H} = \\frac{1}{2} \\E{T} + \\frac{1}{2} \\E{H} = 1.5\n\\] For variance, we need to know \\(\\Cov{T,H}\\). Let’s take \\(\\Cov{T,H} = -1\\) and see what happens. \\[\n\\Var{\\frac{1}{2}T + \\frac{1}{2}H} = \\frac{1}{4} \\Var{T} + \\frac{1}{4} \\Var{H} + \\frac{1}{2} \\Cov{T,H} = 0.0625 + 0.5625 -0.5 = 0.125\n\\]\nNotice that the portfolio variance (0.125) is lower than both individual variances (0.25 and 2.25). This demonstrates the power of diversification - by combining investments with negative covariance, we can reduce overall risk while maintaining the same expected return. The negative covariance indicates that when Tortoise performs well, Hare tends to perform poorly, and vice versa, creating a natural hedge.\nThis example illustrates a fundamental principle in finance and decision theory: diversification can reduce risk without sacrificing expected returns when assets are not perfectly positively correlated. The key insight is that variance depends not only on individual asset volatilities but also on their covariances, making portfolio construction a crucial consideration in risk management.",

    "text": "1.6 Commonly Used Distributions\nHaving explored specific examples of random variables and their properties through the Tortoise and Hare scenario, we now turn to examining some of the most fundamental and widely-used probability distributions. These distributions form the building blocks of probability theory and statistics, appearing repeatedly across diverse fields from finance and engineering to biology and social sciences. Understanding their properties—including their probability mass or density functions, expected values, and variances—is essential for modeling real-world phenomena and making informed decisions under uncertainty. In this section, we’ll introduce several key distributions, starting with the simple yet powerful Bernoulli distribution and building toward more complex models that capture different types of random behavior.\n\nBernoulli Distribution\nThe formal model of a coin toss was described by Bernoulli. He modeled the notion of probability for a coin toss, now known as the Bernoulli distribution, where \\(X \\in \\{0,1\\}\\) and \\(P(X=1)=p, P(X=0) = 1-p\\). Laplace gave us the principle of insufficient reason: where you would list out the possibilities and then place equal probability on each of the outcomes. Essentially the discrete uniform distribution on the set of possible outcomes.\nA Bernoulli trial relates to an experiment with the following conditions\n\nThe result of each trial is either a success or failure.\nThe probability \\(p\\) of a success is the same for all trials.\nThe trials are assumed to be independent.\n\nThe Bernoulli random variable can take on one of two possible outcomes, typically labeled as “success” and “failure.” It is named after the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli, who introduced it in the 18th century. The distribution is often denoted by \\(\\text{Bernoulli}(p)\\), where \\(p\\) is the probability of success.\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of a Bernoulli distribution is defined as follows: \\[\nP(X = x) = \\begin{cases}\np & \\text{if } x = 1 \\\\\n1 - p & \\text{if } x = 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\] The expected value (mean) of a Bernoulli distributed random variable \\(X\\) is given by: \\[\\E{X} = p\n\\] Simply speaking, if you are to toss a coin many times, you expect \\(p\\) heads.\nThe variance of \\(X\\) is given by: \\[\n\\Var{X} = p(1-p)\n\\]\n\nExample 1.15 (Coin Toss) The quintessential random variable is an outcome of a coin toss. The set of all possible outcomes, known as the sample space, is \\(S = \\{H,T\\}\\), and \\(p(X = H) = p(X = T) = 1/2\\). On the other hand, a single outcome can be an element of many different events. For example, there are four possible outcomes of two coin tosses, HH, TT, HT, TH, which are equally likely with probabilities 1/4. The probability mass function over the number of heads \\(X\\) out of two coin tosses is\n\n\n\n\\(x\\)\n\\(p(x)\\)\n\n\n\n\n0\n1/4\n\n\n1\n1/2\n\n\n2\n1/4\n\n\n\nGiven the probability mass function we can, for example, calculate the probability of at least one head as \\(\\prob{X \\geq 1} = \\prob{X =1} + \\prob{X =2} = p(1)+p(2) = 3/4\\).\n\nThe Bernoulli distribution serves as the foundation for more complex distributions, such as the binomial distribution (which models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials) and the geometric distribution (which models the number of trials needed to achieve the first success). A Binomial distribution arises from a sequence of Bernoulli trials, and assigns probability to \\(X\\), which is the number of successes. Its probability distribution is calculated via: \\[\n\\prob{X=x} = {n \\choose x} p^x(1-p)^{n-x}.\n\\] Here \\({n \\choose x}\\) is the combinatorial function, \\[\n{n \\choose x} = \\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!},\n\\] Here compbinatorial function \\({n \\choose x}\\) counts the number of ways of getting \\(x\\) successes in \\(n\\) trials and \\(n!=n(n-1)(n-2)\\ldots 2 \\cdot 1\\) counts the number of permutations of \\(n\\) observations without replacement.\nPlot below shows the probability mass function of a Binomial distribution with \\(n = 20\\) and \\(p = 0.3\\).\n\nbarplot(dbinom(0:20, size = 20, prob = 0.3), names.arg = 0:20, col = \"blue\",\n xlab = \"Number of Heads\", ylab = \"Probability\")\n\n\n\n\nProbability Mass Function of a Binomial Distribution (n = 20, p = 0.3)\n\n\n\n\nThe table below shows the expected value and variance of a Binomial random variable. Those quantities can be calculated by plugging in the possible outcomes ans corresponding probabilities into the definitions of expected value and variance.\n\nMean and Variance of Binomial\n\n\nBinomial Distribution\nParameters\n\n\n\n\nExpected value\n\\(\\mu = \\E{X} = n p\\)\n\n\nVariance\n\\(\\sigma^2 = \\Var{X} = n p ( 1 - p )\\)\n\n\n\nFor large sample sizes \\(n\\), this distribution is approximately normal with mean \\(np\\) and variance of \\(np(1-p)\\).\nSuppose we are about to toss two coins. Let \\(X\\) denote the number of heads. Then the following table specifies the probability distribution \\(p(x)\\) for all possible values \\(x\\) of \\(X\\). This leads to the following table\n\nOutcomes of two coin flips\n\n\n\\(x\\)\n\\(\\prob{X=x}\\)\n\n\n\n\n0\n1/4\n\n\n1\n1/2\n\n\n2\n1/4\n\n\n\nThus, most likely we will see one Head after two tosses. Now, let’s look at a more complex example and introduce our first probability distribution, namely the Binomial distribution.\nLet \\(X\\) be the number of heads in three flips. Each possible outcome (“realization”) of \\(X\\) is an event. Now consider the event of getting only two heads \\[\n\\{ X= 2\\} = \\{ HHT, HTH, THH \\} ,\n\\] The probability distribution of \\(X\\) is Binomial with parameters \\(n = 3, p= 1/2\\), where \\(n\\) denotes the sample size (a.k.a. number of trials) and \\(p\\) is the probability of heads; we have a fair coin. The notation is \\(X \\sim \\mathrm{Bin} \\left ( n = 3 , p = \\frac{1}{2} \\right )\\) where the sign \\(\\sim\\) is read as distributed as.\n\nOutcomes of three coin flips\n\n\nResult\n\\(X\\)\n\\(\\prob{X=x}\\)\n\n\n\n\nHHH\n3\n\\(p^3\\)\n\n\nHHT\n2\n\\(p^2 ( 1- p)\\)\n\n\nHTH\n2\n\\(p^2 ( 1 - p)\\)\n\n\nTHH\n2\n\\((1-p)p^2\\)\n\n\nHTT\n1\n\\(p( 1-p)^2\\)\n\n\nTHT\n1\n\\(p ( 1-p)^2\\)\n\n\nTTH\n1\n\\((1-p)^2 p\\)\n\n\nTTT\n0\n\\((1-p)^3\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nPoisson Distribution\nThe Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event. You can think of Poisson distribution as a limiting case of the Binomial distribution when the number of trials \\(n\\) is large and the probability of success \\(p\\) is small, such that \\(np = \\lambda\\) remains constant. Think of a soccer game where the goal is the “successful” event of interest. The soccer team does not have a predefined number of attempts to score a goal. Rather they continiously try to score a goal until they do. The number of goals scored in a game is the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time. The mean number of goals scored in a game is the mean rate of events occurring in a fixed interval of time.\nThere are many examples of Poisson distributed random variables. For example, the number of phone calls received by a call center per hour, the number of emails received per day, the number of customers arriving at a store per hour, the number of defects in a manufactured product, the number of accidents on a highway per month.\nA random variable \\(X\\) follows a Poisson distribution with parameter \\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\) if its probability mass function is given by: \\[\nP(X = k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}\n\\] for \\(k = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\), where \\(\\lambda\\) is both the mean and variance of the distribution.\nPlot below shows the probability mass function of a Poisson distribution with \\(\\lambda = 1, 5, 10\\).\n\n# Create x values\nx &lt;- 0:20\n\n# Plot the first distribution\nplot(x, dpois(x, lambda = 1), type = \"b\", col = \"blue\", lwd = 2,\n     xlab = \"Number of Events\", ylab = \"Probability\", \n     main = \"Poisson Distribution for Different Lambda Values\",\n     ylim = c(0, 0.4))\n\n# Add the other distributions\nlines(x, dpois(x, lambda = 5), col = \"red\", lwd = 2, type = \"b\")\nlines(x, dpois(x, lambda = 10), col = \"green\", lwd = 2, type = \"b\")\n\n# Add legend\nlegend(\"topright\", legend = c(\"lmb = 1\", \"lmb = 5\", \"lmb = 10\"), \n       col = c(\"blue\", \"red\", \"green\"), lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\nProbability Mass Function of a Poisson Distribution\n\n\n\n\nWe write \\(X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)\\) to denote that \\(X\\) follows a Poisson distribution with parameter \\(\\lambda\\).\n\nMean and Variance of Poisson\n\n\nPoisson Distribution\nParameters\n\n\n\n\nExpected value\n\\(\\mu = \\E{X} = \\lambda\\)\n\n\nVariance\n\\(\\sigma^2 = \\Var{X} = \\lambda\\)\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.16 (Customer Arrivals) Suppose customers arrive at a coffee shop at an average rate of 3 customers per hour. What is the probability that exactly 5 customers will arrive in the next hour?\nUsing the Poisson distribution with \\(\\lambda = 3\\): \\[\nP(X = 5) = \\frac{3^5 e^{-3}}{5!} = \\frac{243 \\times e^{-3}}{120} \\approx 0.101\n\\]\nSo there is approximately a 10.1% chance that exactly 5 customers will arrive in the next hour.\n\nThe Poisson distribution can be derived as a limiting case of the binomial distribution when \\(n\\) is large and \\(p\\) is small, such that \\(np = \\lambda\\) remains constant. This connection makes the Poisson distribution particularly useful for modeling rare events in large populations.\n\n\nNormal Distribution\nThe Normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is widely used in statistics and probability theory. It is also known as the Gaussian distribution or the bell curve. The Normal distribution is characterized by its symmetric bell-shaped curve and is defined by two parameters: the mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and the variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)).\nThe probability density function (PDF) of the Normal distribution is given by: \\[\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\n\\] for \\(-\\infty &lt; x &lt; \\infty\\), where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation.\nThe plot below shows the probability density function of a random variable \\(X \\sim N(0,1)\\) that follows a Normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n\nx &lt;- seq(-4, 4, length.out = 100)\nplot(x, dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1), type = \"l\", col = \"blue\", lwd = 2,\n     xlab = \"x\", ylab = \"f(x)\",\n     main = \"Normal Distribution for Mean 0 and Standard Deviation 1\")\n\n\n\n\nProbability Density Function of a Normal Distribution\n\n\n\n\nThe Normal distribution is symmetric around the mean, and the mean, median, and mode are all equal.\nThe Normal distribution is often used to model real-world phenomena such as measurement errors, heights, weights, and scores on standardized tests. It is also used in hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction.\n\nExample 1.17 (Heights of Adults) The heights of adult males in a certain population are normally distributed with a mean of 70 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches.\n\nWhat is the probability that a randomly selected male is between 67 and 73 inches tall?\n\nUsing the Normal distribution with \\(\\mu = 70\\) and \\(\\sigma = 3\\):\n\n\nCode\n# Define parameters\nmu &lt;- 70\nsigma &lt;- 3\n\n# Create x values for the curve\nx &lt;- seq(mu - 4*sigma, mu + 4*sigma, length.out = 1000)\ny &lt;- dnorm(x, mean = mu, sd = sigma)\n\n# Plot the normal curve\nplot(x, y, type = \"l\", lwd = 2, col = \"blue\",\n     xlab = \"Height (inches)\", ylab = \"Density\",\n     main = \"Normal Distribution (mu = 70, sigma = 3)\")\n\n# Add vertical lines at 67 and 73\nabline(v = 67, col = \"red\", lty = 2, lwd = 2)\nabline(v = 73, col = \"red\", lty = 2, lwd = 2)\n\n# Highlight the area between 67 and 73\nx_area &lt;- seq(67, 73, length.out = 100)\ny_area &lt;- dnorm(x_area, mean = mu, sd = sigma)\npolygon(c(67, x_area, 73), c(0, y_area, 0), \n         col = rgb(0, 0, 1, alpha = 0.3), border = NA)\n\n# Add labels\ntext(67, -0.005, \"67\", col = \"red\", cex = 1.2)\ntext(73, -0.005, \"73\", col = \"red\", cex = 1.2)\ntext(70, 0.06, \"P(67 &lt; X &lt; 73)\", cex = 1.2, col = \"darkblue\")\n\n# Add grid for better readability\ngrid(col = \"gray\", lty = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal Distribution with Highlighted Area\n\n\n\n\nThe prrobability of a randomly selected male being between 67 and 73 inches tall is the area under the curve between 67 and 73 inches and is approximately 0.6827.\nNow let’s calculate this probability using R:\n\nprob_between &lt;- pnorm(73, mean = 70, sd = 3) - pnorm(67, mean = 70, sd = 3)\ncat(\"P(67 &lt; X &lt; 73) =\", round(prob_between, 4), \"\\n\")\n\n## P(67 &lt; X &lt; 73) = 0.68\n\n\nThe calculation shows that \\(P(67 &lt; X &lt; 73) = P(X \\leq 73) - P(X \\leq 67) \\approx 0.6827\\).\nThis result makes sense because 67 and 73 inches are exactly one standard deviation below and above the mean (70 ± 3), respectively. According to the empirical rule (68-95-99.7 rule), approximately 68% of values in a normal distribution fall within one standard deviation of the mean.\nSo approximately 68.27% of adult males are between 67 and 73 inches tall.\n\nWhat height corresponds to the 95th percentile?\n\nWe need to find \\(x\\) such that \\(P(X \\leq x) = 0.95\\). From standard normal tables, \\(\\Phi^{-1}(0.95) \\approx 1.645\\).\n\nx &lt;- qnorm(0.95, mean = 70, sd = 3)\ncat(\"Height corresponding to the 95th percentile:\", round(x, 2), \"inches\\n\")\n\n## Height corresponding to the 95th percentile: 75 inches\n\n\nTherefore: \\(x = \\mu + \\sigma \\cdot 1.645 = 70 + 3 \\cdot 1.645 = 74.935\\) inches.",

    "text": "1.7 Conditional, Marginal and Joint Distributions\nSuppose that we have two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), which can be related to each other. Knowing \\(X\\) would change your belief about \\(Y\\). For example, as a first pass, psychologists who study the phenomenon of happiness can be interested in understanding its relation to income level. Now we need a single probability mass function (a.k.a. probabilistic model) that describes all possible values of those two variables. Joint distributions do exactly that.\nFormally, the joint distribution of two variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is a function given by \\[\np(x,y) = \\prob{X=x,Y=y}.\n\\] This maps all combinations of possible values of these two variables to a probability on the interval [0,1].\nThe conditional probability is a measure of the probability of a random variable \\(X\\), given that the value of another random variable was observed \\(Y = y\\). \\[\np(x\\mid y) = \\prob{X = x \\mid Y = y}.\n\\]\nThe marginal probability of a subset of a collection of random variables is the probability distribution of the variables contained in the subset without reference to the values of the other variables. Say we have two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), the marginal probability \\(\\prob{X}\\) is the probability distribution of \\(X\\) when the values of \\(Y\\) are not taken into consideration. This can be calculated by summing the joint probability distribution over all values of \\(Y\\). The converse is also true: the marginal distribution can be obtained for \\(Y\\) by summing over the separate values of \\(X\\).\nMarginal probability is different from conditional probability. Marginal probability is the probability of a single event occurring, independent of other events. A conditional probability, on the other hand, is the probability that an event occurs given that another specific event has already occurred.\n\nExample 1.18 (Salary-Happiness) Let’s look at an example. Suppose that to model the relationship between two quantities, salary \\(Y\\) and happiness \\(X\\). After running a survey, we summarize our results using the joint distribution, that is described by the following “happiness index” table as a function of salary.\n\n\n\nResults of the Gallup survey. Rows are Salary (\\(Y\\)) and columns are happiness (\\(X\\))\n\n\n\nX = 0 (low)\nX = 1 (medium)\nX = 2 (high)\n\n\n\n\nY = low (0)\n0.03\n0.13\n0.14\n\n\nY = medium (1)\n0.12\n0.11\n0.01\n\n\nY = high (2)\n0.07\n0.01\n0.09\n\n\nY = very high (3)\n0.02\n0.13\n0.14\n\n\n\n\n\nEach cell of the table is the joint probability, e.g. 14% of people have very high income level and are very happy. Those joint probabilities are calculated by simple counting and calculating the proportions.\nNow, if we want to answer the question what is the percent of high earners in the population. For that we need to calculate what is called a marginal probability \\(\\prob{y = 2}\\). We can calculate the proportion of high earners \\(\\prob{y = 2}\\) by summing up the entries in the third row of the table, which is 0.17 in our case.\n\n0.07 + 0.01 + 0.09\n\n## [1] 0.17\n\n\nFormally marginal probability over \\(y\\) is calculated by summing the joint probability over the other variable, \\(x\\), \\[\np(y) = \\sum_{x \\in S}p(x,y)\n\\] Where \\(S\\) is the set of all possible values of the random variable \\(X\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother question of interest is whether happiness depends on income level. To answer those types of questions, we need to introduce an important concept, which is the conditional probability of \\(X\\) given that the value of variable \\(Y\\) is known. This is denoted by \\(\\prob{X=x\\mid Y=y}\\) or simply \\(p(x\\mid y)\\), where \\(\\mid\\) reads as “given” or “conditional upon”.\nThe conditional probability \\(p(x\\mid y)\\) also has interpretation as updating your probability over \\(X\\) after you have learned the new information about \\(Y\\). In this sense, probability is also the language of how you change opinions in light of new evidence. The proportion of happy people among high earners is given by the conditional probability \\(\\prob{X=2\\mid Y=2}\\) and can be calculated by dividing the proportion of those who are high earners and highly happy by the proportion of high earners \\[\n\\prob{X=2\\mid Y=2} = \\dfrac{\\prob{X=2,Y=2}}{\\prob{Y=2}} = \\dfrac{0.09}{0.17} = 0.5294118.\n\\]\nNow, if we compare it with the proportion of highly happy people \\(\\prob{X = 2} = 0.38\\), we see that on average you are more likely to be happy given your income is high.",

    "section": "1.8 Independence",
    "text": "1.8 Independence\nHistorically, the concept of independence in experiments and random variables has been a defining mathematical characteristic that has uniquely shaped the theory of probability. This concept has been instrumental in distinguishing the theory of probability from other mathematical theories.\nUsing the notion of conditional probability, we can define independence of two variables. Two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are said to be independent if \\[\n\\prob{Y = y \\mid X = x} = \\prob{Y = y},\n\\] for all possible \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) values. That is, learning information \\(X=x\\) doesn’t affect our probabilistic assessment of \\(Y\\) for any value \\(y\\). This is known as the Prosecutor’s Fallacy as it arises when probability is used as evidence in a court of law. In the case of independence, \\(p(x \\mid y) = p(x)\\) and \\(p(y \\mid x) = p(y)\\). Specifically, the probability of innocence given the evidence is not the same as the probability of evidence given innocence. It is very important to ask the question “what exactly are we conditioning on?” Usually, the observed evidence or data. Probability, of course, given evidence was one of the first applications of Bayes. Central to personalized probability. Clearly this is a strong condition and rarely holds in practice.\nConditional probabilities are counter-intuitive. For example, one of the most important properties is typically \\(p( x \\mid y ) \\neq p( y\\mid x )\\).\nWe just derived an important relation that allows us to calculate conditional probability \\(p(x \\mid y)\\) when we know joint probability \\(p(x,y)\\) and marginal probability \\(p(y)\\). The total probability or evidence can be calculated as usual, via \\(p(y) = \\sum_{x}p(x,y)\\).\nWe will see that independence will lead to a different conclusion than the Bayes conditional probability decomposition: specifically, independence yields \\(p( x,y ) = p(x) p(y)\\) and Bayes says \\(p(x ,y) = p(x)p(y \\mid x)\\).\nWe need to specify a distribution on each of those variables. Two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent if \\[\n\\prob{Y = y \\mid X = x} = \\prob{Y = y},\n\\] for all possible \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) values. The joint distribution will be given by \\[\np(x,y) = p(x)p(y).\n\\] If \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent then the probability of event \\(X\\) and event \\(Y\\) happening 00 is the product of individual probabilities. From the conditional distribution formula it follows that \\[\np(x \\mid y) = \\dfrac{p(x,y)}{p(y)} = \\dfrac{p(x)p(y)}{p(y)} = p(x).\n\\] Another way to think of independence is to say that knowing the value of \\(Y\\) doesn’t tell us anything about possible values of \\(X\\). For example when tossing a coin twice, the probability of getting \\(H\\) in the second toss does not depend on the outcome of the first toss.\nThe expression of independence expresses the fact that knowing \\(X=x\\) tells you nothing about \\(Y\\). In the coin tossing example, if \\(X\\) is the outcome of the first toss and \\(Y\\) is the outcome of the second toss \\[\n\\prob{ X=H  \\mid  Y=T } = \\prob{X=H  \\mid  Y=H } = \\prob{X=H}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nDiaconis, Persi, and Frederick and Mosteller. 1989. “Methods for Studying Coincidences.” Journal of the American Statistical Association 84 (408): 853–61.\n\n\nKeynes, John Maynard. 1921.

    "text": "2.1 Law of Total Probability\nOne of the key questions in the theory of learning is: How do you update your beliefs in the presence of new information? Bayes rule provides the answer. Conditional probability can be interpreted as updating your probability of event \\(A\\) after you have learned the new information that \\(B\\) has occurred. In this sense probability is also the language of how you’ll change options in the light of new evidence. For example, we need to find the probability that a thrown die shows on its upper surface an odd number and we found out that the number shown is less than 4.\nProbability rules allow us to change our mind if the facts change. For example, suppose that \\(B = \\{ B_1 , B_2 \\}\\) consists of two pieces of information and that we are interested in \\(P(A\\mid B_1,B_2)\\). Bayes rule simply lets you calculate this conditional probability in a sequential fashion. First, conditioning on the information contained in \\(B_1\\), lets us calculate \\[\nP( A| B_1 ) = \\frac{ p(  B_1 \\mid A ) P( A) }{ P( B_1 ) }\n\\] Then, using the posterior probability \\(P( A| B_1 )\\) as the “new” prior for the next piece of information \\(B_2\\) lets us find \\[\nP( A| B_1 , B_2 ) = \\frac{ p(  B_2 \\mid B_1 , A ) P( A \\mid B_1 ) }{ P( B_2 \\mid B_1 ) }\n\\] Hence, we see that we need assessments of the two conditional probabilities \\(P( B_1 \\mid A )\\) and \\(P( B_2 \\mid B_1 , A )\\). In many situations, the latter will be simply \\(P( B_2 \\mid A )\\) and not involve \\(B_1\\). The events \\(( B_1, B_2 )\\) will be said to be conditionally independent given \\(A\\).\nThis concept generalizes to a sequence of events where \\(B = \\{ B_1,\\ldots B_n \\}\\). When learning from data we will use this property all the time. An illustrative example will be the Black Swan problem which we discuss later.\nBayes’ rule is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. It describes how to update our beliefs about an event based on new evidence. We start with an initial belief about the probability of an event (called the prior probability). We then observe some conditional information (e.g. evidence). We use Bayes’ rule to update our initial belief based on the evidence, resulting in a new belief called the posterior probability. Remember, the formula is \\[\nP(A\\mid B) = \\dfrac{P(B\\mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}\n\\] where:\nThe ability to use Bayes rule sequentially is key in many applications, when we need to update our beliefs in the presence of new information. For example, Bayesian learning was used by mathematician Alan Turing in England at Bletchley Park to break the German Enigma code - a development that helped the Allies win the Second World War (Simpson 2010). Turing called his algorithm Banburismus, it is a process he invented which used sequential conditional probability to infer information about the likely settings of the Enigma machine.\nDennis Lindley argued that we should all be trained in Bayes rule and conditional probability can be simply viewed as disciplined probability accounting. Akin to how market odds change as evidence changes. One issue is human behavior and intuition is not well trained in how to use Bayes rule, akin to learning the Alphabet!\nThe Law of Total Probability is a fundamental rule relating marginal probabilities to conditional probabilities. It’s particularly useful when you’re dealing with a set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive events.\nSuppose you have a set of events \\(B_1, B_2, ..., B_n\\) that are mutually exclusive (i.e., no two events can occur at the same time) and collectively exhaustive (i.e., at least one of the events must occur). The Law of Total Probability states that for any other event \\(A\\), the probability of \\(A\\) occurring can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of \\(A\\) occurring given each \\(B_i\\), multiplied by the probability of each \\(B_i\\) occurring.\nMathematically, it is expressed as:\n\\[\nP(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A\\mid  B_i) P(B_i)\n\\]\nThis law is particularly useful in complex probability problems where direct calculation of probability is difficult. By breaking down the problem into conditional probabilities based on relevant events, it simplifies the calculation and helps to derive a solution.",

Bag 1 contains 3 red and 7 blue balls, while Bag 2 contains 6 red and 4 blue balls. You randomly choose one of the bags and then randomly draw a ball from that bag. What is the probability of drawing a red ball?\nHere, the events \\(B_1\\) and \\(B_2\\) can be choosing Bag 1 and Bag 2, respectively. You want to find drawing a red ball (event \\(A\\)).\nApplying the law:\n\n\\(P(A|B_1)\\) is the probability of drawing a red ball from Bag 1, which is \\(\\frac{3}{10}\\).\n\\(P(A|B_2)\\) is the probability of drawing a red ball from Bag 2, which is \\(\\frac{6}{10}\\).\nAssume the probability of choosing either bag is equal, so \\(P(B_1) = P(B_2) = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nUsing the Law of Total Probability:\n\\[\nP(A) = P(A|B_1) \\times P(B_1) + P(A|B_2) \\times P(B_2)= \\frac{3}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{6}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{9}{20}\n\\]\nSo, the probability of drawing a red ball in this scenario is \\(\\frac{9}{20}\\).\n\n\n\nExample 2.3 (Craps) Craps is a fast-moving dice game with a complex betting layout.

When 2, 3 or 12 comes up, this is known as “craps”, you lose. When 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 comes up, this number is called the “point”, the bettor continues to roll until a 7 (you lose) or the point comes up (you win).\nWe need to know the probability of winning.

    "section": "2.2 Naive Bayes",
    "text": "2.2 Naive Bayes\nUse of the Bayes rule allows us to build our first predictive model, called Naive Bayes classifier. Naive Bayes is a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms that all share a common principle, that every feature being classified is independent of the value of any other feature. For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 3” in diameter. A Naive Bayes classifier considers each of these “features” (red, round, 3” in diameter) to contribute independently to the probability that the fruit is an apple, regardless of any correlations between features. Features, however, aren’t always independent which is often seen as a shortcoming of the Naive Bayes algorithm and this is why it’s labeled “naive”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph TB\n    C((Color)) --&gt; F((Fruit))\n    S((Size)) --&gt; F\n    Sh((Shape)) --&gt; F\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it’s a relatively simple idea, Naive Bayes can often outperform other more sophisticated algorithms and is extremely useful in common applications like spam detection and document classification. In a nutshell, the algorithm allows us to predict a class, given a set of features using probability. So in another fruit example, we could predict whether a fruit is an apple, orange or banana (class) based on its colour, shape etc (features). In summary, the advantages are:\n\nIt’s relatively simple to understand and build\nIt’s easily trained, even with a small dataset\nIt’s fast!\nIt’s not sensitive to irrelevant features\n\nThe main disadvantage is that it assumes every feature is independent, which isn’t always the case.\nLet’s say we have data on 1000 pieces of fruit. The fruit being a Banana, Orange or some Other fruit and imagine we know 3 features of each fruit, whether it’s long or not, sweet or not and yellow or not, as displayed in the table below:\n\n\n\nFruit\nLong\nSweet\nYellow\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nBanana\n400\n350\n450\n500\n\n\nOrange\n0\n150\n300\n300\n\n\nOther\n100\n150\n50\n200\n\n\nTotal\n500\n650\n800\n1000\n\n\n\nFrom this data we can calculate marginal probabilities\n\n50% of the fruits are bananas\n30% are oranges\n20% are other fruits\n\nBased on our training set we can also say the following:\n\nFrom 500 bananas 400 (0.8) are Long, 350 (0.7) are Sweet and 450 (0.9) are Yellow\nOut of 300 oranges 0 are Long, 150 (0.5) are Sweet and 300 (1) are Yellow\nFrom the remaining 200 fruits, 100 (0.5) are Long, 150 (0.75) are Sweet and 50 (0.25) are Yellow So let’s say we’re given the features of a piece of fruit and we need to predict the class. If we’re told that the additional fruit is Long, Sweet and Yellow, we can classify it using the following formula and subbing in the values for each outcome, whether it’s a Banana, an Orange or Other Fruit. The one with the highest probability (score) being the winner.\n\nGiven the evidence \\(E\\) (\\(L\\) = Long, \\(S\\) = Sweet and \\(Y\\) = Yellow) we can calculate the probability of each class \\(C\\) (\\(B\\) = Banana, \\(O\\) = Orange or \\(F\\) = Other Fruit) using Bayes’ Theorem: \\[\\begin{align*}\nP(B \\mid E) = & \\frac{P(L \\mid B)P(S \\mid B)P(Y \\mid B)P(B)}{P(L)P(S)P(Y)}\\\\\n=&\\frac{0.8\\times 0.7\\times 0.9\\times 0.5}{P(E)}=\\frac{0.252}{P(E)}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nOrange: \\[\nP(O\\mid E)=0.\n\\]\nOther Fruit: \\[\\begin{align*}\nP(F \\mid E) & = \\frac{P(L \\mid F)P(S \\mid F)P(Y \\mid F)P(F)}{P(L)P(S)P(Y)}\\\\\n=&\\frac{0.5\\times 0.75\\times 0.25\\times 0.2}{P(E)}=\\frac{0.01875}{P(E)}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nIn this case, based on the higher score, we can assume this Long, Sweet and Yellow fruit is, in fact, a Banana.\nNotice, we did not have to calculate \\(P(E)\\) because it is a normalizing constant and it cancels out when we calculate the ratio\n\\[\n\\dfrac{P(B \\mid E)}{P(F \\mid E)} = 0.252/0.01875 = 13.44 &gt; 1.\n\\]\nNow that we’ve seen a basic example of Naive Bayes in action, you can easily see how it can be applied to Text Classification problems such as spam detection, sentiment analysis and categorization. By looking at documents as a set of words, which would represent features, and labels (e.g. “spam” and “ham” in case of spam detection) as classes we can start to classify documents and text automatically.\n\nExample 2.4 (Spam Filtering) The original spam filtering algorithm was based on Naive Bayes. The “naive” aspect of Naive Bayes comes from the assumption that inputs (words in the case of text classification) are conditionally independent, given the class label. Naive Bayes treats each word independently, and the model doesn’t capture the sequential or structural information inherent in the language. It does not consider grammatical relationships or syntactic structures. The algorithm doesn’t understand the grammatical rules that dictate how words should be combined to form meaningful sentences. Further, it doesn’t understand the context in which words appear. For example, it may treat the word “bank” the same whether it refers to a financial institution or the side of a river bank. Despite its simplicity and the naive assumption, Naive Bayes often performs well in practice, especially in text classification tasks.\nWe start by collecting a dataset of emails labeled as “spam” or “not spam” (ham) and calculate the prior probabilities of spam (\\(P(\\text{spam})\\)) and not spam (\\(P(\\text{ham})\\)) based on the training dataset, by simply counting the proportions of each in the data.\nThen each email gets converted into a bag-of-words representation (ignoring word order and considering only word frequencies). Then, we create a vocabulary of unique words from the entire dataset \\(w_1,w_2,\\ldots,w_N\\) and calculate conditional probabilities \\[\nP(\\mathrm{word}_i  \\mid  \\text{spam}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of spam emails containing }\\mathrm{word}_i}{\\text{Total number of spam emails}}, ~ i=1,\\ldots,n\n\\] \\[\nP(\\mathrm{word}_i  \\mid  \\text{ham}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of ham emails containing }\\mathrm{word}_i}{\\text{Total number of ham emails}}, ~ i=1,\\ldots,n\n\\]\nNow, we are ready to use our model to classify new emails. We do it by calculating the posterior probability using Bayes’ theorem. Say an email has a set of \\(k\\) words \\(\\text{email} = \\{w_{e1},w_{e2},\\ldots, w_{ek}\\}\\), then \\[\nP(\\text{spam}  \\mid  \\text{email}) = \\frac{P(\\text{email}  \\mid  \\text{spam}) \\times P(\\text{spam})}{P(\\text{email})}\n\\] Here \\[\nP(\\text{email}  \\mid  \\text{spam}) = P( w_{e1}  \\mid  \\text{spam})P( w_{e2}  \\mid  \\text{spam})\\ldots P( w_{ek}  \\mid  \\text{spam})\n\\] We calculate \\(P(\\text{ham} \\mid \\text{email})\\) in a similar way.\nFinally, we classify the email as spam or ham based on the class with the highest posterior probability.\nSuppose you have a spam email with the word “discount” appearing. Using Naive Bayes, you’d calculate the probability that an email containing “discount” is spam \\(P(\\text{spam} \\mid \\text{discount})\\) and ham \\(P(\\text{ham} \\mid \\text{discount})\\), and then compare these probabilities to make a classification decision.\nWhile the naive assumption simplifies the model and makes it computationally efficient, it comes at the cost of a more nuanced understanding of language. More sophisticated models, such as transformers, have been developed to address these limitations by considering the sequential nature of language and capturing contextual relationships between words.\nIn summary, naive Bayes, due to its simplicity and the naive assumption of independence, is not capable of understanding the rules of grammar, the order of words, or the intricate context in which words are used. It is a basic algorithm suitable for certain tasks but may lack the complexity needed for tasks that require a deeper understanding of language structure and semantics.",

He was analyzing damages on the US planes that came back from bombing missions in Germany. Somebody suggested to analyze the distribution of the hits over different parts of the plane. The idea was to find a pattern in the damages and design a reinforcement strategy.\nAfter examining hundreds of damaged airplanes, researchers came up with the following table\n\n\n\nLocation\nNumber of Planes\n\n\n\n\nEngine\n53\n\n\nCockpit\n65\n\n\nFuel system\n96\n\n\nWings, fuselage, etc.\n434\n\n\n\nWe can convert those counts to probabilities\n\n\n\nLocation\nNumber of Planes\n\n\n\n\nEngine\n0.08\n\n\nCockpit\n0.1\n\n\nFuel system\n0.15\n\n\nWings, fuselage, etc.\n0.67\n\n\n\nWe can conclude that the most likely area to be damaged on the returned planes was the wings and fuselage. \\[\n\\prob{\\mbox{hit on wings or fuselage } \\mid \\mbox{returns safely}} = 0.67\n\\] Wald realized that analyzing damages only on survived planes is not the right approach. Instead, he suggested that it is essential to calculate the inverse probability \\[\n\\prob{\\mbox{returns safely} \\mid \\mbox{hit on wings or fuselage }} = ?\n\\] To calculate that, he interviewed many engineers and pilots, he performed a lot of field experiments. He analyzed likely attack angles. He studied the properties of a shrapnel cloud from a flak gun. He suggested to the army that they fire thousands of dummy bullets at a plane sitting on the tarmac. Wald constructed a ‘probability model’ carefully to reconstruct an estimate for the joint probabilities. The table below shows the results.\n\n\n\nHit\nReturned\nShot Down\n\n\n\n\nEngine\n53\n57\n\n\nCockpit\n65\n46\n\n\nFuel system\n96\n16\n\n\nWings, fuselage, etc.\n434\n33\n\n\n\nWhich allows us to estimate joint probabilities, for example \\[\n\\prob{\\mbox{outcome = returns safely} , \\mbox{hit  =  engine }} = 53/800 = 0.066\n\\] We also can calculate the conditional probabilities now \\[\n\\prob{\\mbox{outcome = returns safely} \\mid  \\mbox{hit  =  wings or fuselage  }} = \\dfrac{434}{434+33} = 0.9293362.\n\\] Should we reinforce wings or fuselage? Which part of the airplane needs to be reinforced? \\[\n\\prob{\\mbox{outcome = returns safely} \\mid  \\mbox{hit  =  engine  }} = \\dfrac{53}{53+57} = 0.48\n\\] Here is another illustration taken from the Economics literature. This insight led to George Akerlof winning the Nobel Prize for the concept of asymmetric information.\n\n\nExample 2.8 (Coin Jar) Large jar containing 1024 fair coins and one two-headed coin. You pick one at random and flip it \\(10\\) times and get all heads. What’s the probability that the coin is the two-headed coin? The probability of initially picking the two headed coin is 1/1025. There is a 1/1024 chance of getting \\(10\\) heads in a row from a fair coin. Therefore, it’s a \\(50/50\\) bet.\nLet’s do the formal Bayes rule math. Let \\(E\\) be the event that you get \\(10\\) Heads in a row, then\n\\[\nP \\left ( \\mathrm{two \\; headed}  \\mid  E \\right ) = \\frac{ P \\left ( E  \\mid  \\mathrm{ two \\; headed}  \\right )P \\left (  \\mathrm{ two \\; headed} \\right )}\n{P \\left ( E  \\mid  \\mathrm{ fair}  \\right )P \\left ( \\mathrm{ fair} \\right ) + P \\left ( E  \\mid  \\mathrm{ two \\; headed}  \\right )P \\left ( \\mathrm{ two \\; headed} \\right )}\n\\] Therefore, the posterior probability \\[\nP \\left (  \\mathrm{ two \\; headed}  \\mid  E \\right ) = \\frac{ 1 \\times \\frac{1}{1025} }{ \\frac{1}{1024} \\times \\frac{1024}{1025} + 1 \\times \\frac{1}{1025} } = 0.50\n\\] What’s the probability that the next toss is a head?

The Monty Hall problem was named after the host of the long-running TV show Let’s Make a Deal. The original solution was proposed by Marilyn vos Savant, who had a column with the correct answer that many Mathematicians thought was wrong!\nThe game set-up is as follows. A contestant is given the choice of 3 doors. There is a prize (a car, say) behind one of the doors and something worthless behind the other two doors: two goats. The game is as follows:\n\nYou pick a door.\nMonty then opens one of the other two doors, revealing a goat. He can’t open your door or show you a car\nYou have the choice of switching doors.\n\nThe question is, is it advantageous to switch? The answer is yes. The probability of winning if you switch is 2/3 and if you don’t switch is 1/3.\nConditional probabilities allow us to answer this question. Assume you pick door 2 (event \\(A\\)) at random, given that the host opened Door 3 and showed a goat (event B), we need to calculate \\(P(A\\mid B)\\). The prior probability that the car is behind Door 2 is \\(P(A) =  1/3\\) and \\(P(B\\mid A) = 1\\), if the car is behind Door 2, the host has no choice but to open Door 3. The Bayes rule then gives us \\[\nP(A\\mid B) = \\frac{P(B\\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)} = \\frac{1/3}{1/2} = \\frac{2}{3}.\n\\] The overall probability of the host opening Door 3 \\[\nP(B) = (1/3 \\times 1/2) + (1/3 \\times 1) = 1/6 + 1/3 = 1/2.\n\\]\nThe posterior probability that the car is behind Door 2 after the host opens Door 3 is 2/3. It is to your advantage to switch doors.\n\n\nExample 2.10 (Prosecutors Fallacy) The Prosecutor’s Fallacy is a logical error that occurs when a prosecutor presents evidence or statistical data in a way that suggests a defendant’s guilt, even though the evidence is not as conclusive as it may seem. This fallacy arises from a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of conditional probabilities and not understanding that \\[\nP(E\\mid G) \\ne P(G\\mid E)\n\\]\nIt involves confusion between the probability of two events: the probability of the evidence \\(E\\), given the defendant’s guilt (which is what the prosecutor may be presenting), and the probability of the defendant’s guilt \\(G\\), given the evidence (which is what is often of more interest in a trial).\nHere’s a simplified example to illustrate the Prosecutor’s Fallacy. Suppose a crime has been committed, and DNA evidence is found at the crime scene. The prosecutor claims that the probability of finding this particular DNA at the scene, given the defendant’s innocence, is very low (making the evidence seem incriminating). However, the Prosecutor’s Fallacy occurs when the prosecutor incorrectly assumes that this low probability implies a low probability of the defendant’s innocence. In reality, the probability of the DNA being found at the crime scene (given the defendant’s innocence) might also be low if the DNA is relatively rare but not exclusive to the defendant.\nThe fallacy often arises from a failure to consider the base rate or prior probability of the event being investigated. To avoid the Prosecutor’s Fallacy, it’s crucial to carefully distinguish between the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (guilt or innocence) and the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.\nConsider a more concrete example of base rate fallacy. Say we have a witness who is 80% certain she saw a “checker” (\\(C\\)) taxi in the accident. We need to calculate \\(P(C\\mid E)\\). Assuming the base rate of 20% \\(P(C) = 0.2\\), we get \\[\nP(C\\mid E) = \\dfrac{P(E\\mid C)P(C)}{P(E)} = \\dfrac{0.8\\cdot 0.2}{0.8\\cdot 0.2 + 0.2\\cdot 0.8} = 0.5\n\\] The witness identification accuracy \\(P(C\\mid E) = 0.8\\) is called the sensitivity.\nEven with a highly accurate witness, the probability that the identified taxi is a Checker will be less than 80%, reflecting the impact of the base rate. Ignoring the base rate can lead to a significant overestimation of the probability of the identified event.\n\n\nExample 2.11 (Law Example)  \n\nSuppose you’re serving on a jury in the city of New York, with a population of roughly 10 million people. A man stands before you accused of murder, and you are asked to judge whether he is guilty \\(G\\) or not guilty \\(\\bar G\\). In his opening remarks, the prosecutor tells you that the defendant has been arrested on the strength of a single, overwhelming piece of evidence: that his DNA matched a sample of DNA taken from the scene of the crime. Let’s denote this evidence by the letter \\(D\\). To convince you of the strength of this evidence, the prosecutor calls a forensic scientist to the stand, who testifies that the probability that an innocent person’s DNA would match the sample found at the crime scene is only one in a million. The prosecution then rests its case. Would you vote to convict this man? If you answered “yes,” you might want to reconsider! You are charged with assessing \\(P(G \\mid D)\\) - that is, the probability that the defendant is guilty, given the information that his DNA matched the sample taken from the scene. Bayes’ rule tells us that \\[\nP(G\\mid D)= P(G)P(D\\mid G)/P(D), ~ P(D) = P(D \\mid G)P(G) + P(D \\mid \\bar G)P(\\bar G)\n\\] We know the following quantities:\n\nThe prior probability of guilt, \\(P(G)\\), is about one in 10 million. New York City has 10 million people, and one of them committed the crime.\nThe probability of a false match, \\(P(D \\mid \\bar G)\\), is one in a million, because the forensic scientist testified to this fact.\n\nTo use Bayes’ rule, let’s make one additional assumption: that the likelihood, \\(P(D\\mid  G)\\), is equal to 1. This means we’re assuming that, if the accused were guilty, there is a 100% chance of seeing a positive result from the DNA test. Let’s plug these numbers into Bayes’ rule and see what we get: \\[\nP(G\\mid D) = 0.09\n\\] The probability of guilt looks to be only 9%! This result seems shocking in light of the forensic scientist’s claim that \\(P(D \\mid \\bar G)\\) is so small: a “one in a million chance” of a positive match for an innocent person. Yet the prior probability of guilt is very low \\(P(G)\\) is a mere one in 10 million - and so even very strong evidence still only gets us up to \\(P(G | D) = 0.09\\).\nConflating \\(P(\\bar G \\mid  D)\\) with \\(P(D \\mid \\bar G)\\) is a serious error in probabilistic reasoning. These two numbers are typically very different from one another, because conditional probabilities aren’t symmetric. As we’ve said more than once, \\(P(\\text{practices hard} \\mid \\text{plays in NBA}) \\approx 1\\), while \\(P(\\text{plays in NBA} \\mid \\text{practices hard}) \\approx 0\\). An alternate way of thinking about this result is the following. Of the 10 million innocent people in New York, ten would have DNA matches merely by chance. The one guilty person would also have a DNA match. Hence there are 11 people with a DNA match, only one of whom is guilty, and so \\(P(G \\mid D) \\approx 1/11\\). Your intuition may mislead, but Bayes’ rule never does!\n\n\nExample 2.12 (Island Problem) There are \\(N+1\\) people on the island and one is a criminal. We have probability of a trait of a criminal equal to \\(p\\), which is \\(p = P(E\\mid I)\\), the probability of evidence, given innocence. Then we have a suspect who is matching the trait and we need to find probability of being guilty, given the evidence \\(P(G \\mid E)\\). It is easier to do the Bayes rule in the odds form. There are three components to the calculations: the prior odds of innocence, \\[\nO ( I ) = P (G) / P ( I ),\n\\] the Bayes factor, \\[\n\\frac{P(E\\mid G)}{P(E\\mid I)}.\n\\] and the posterior odds of innocence. \\[\n    O(I\\mid E) = \\dfrac{P(G\\mid E)}{P(I\\mid E)} = \\dfrac{1}{Np}.\n\\]\nCromwell’s rule states that the use of prior probability of 1 or 0 should be avoided except when it is known for certain that the probability is 1 or 0. It is named after Oliver Cromwell who wrote to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1650 “I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible that you may be mistaken”. In other words, using the Bayes rule \\[\nP(G\\mid E) = \\dfrac{P(E\\mid G)}{P(E)}P(G),\n\\] if \\(P(G)\\) is zero, it does not matter what the evidence is. Symmetrically, probability of innocence is zero if the evidence is certain. In other words, if \\(P(E\\mid I) = 0\\), then \\(P(I\\mid E) = 0\\). This is a very strong statement. It is not always true, but it is a good rule of thumb, it is a good way to avoid the prosecutor’s fallacy.\n\n\nExample 2.13 (Nakamura’s Alleged Cheating) In our paper Maharaj, Polson, and Sokolov (2023), we provide a statistical analysis of the recent controversy between Vladimir Kramnik (ex-world champion) and Hikaru Nakamura. Kramnik called into question Nakamura’s 45.5 out of 46 win streak in a 3+0 online blitz contest at chess.com. In this example we reproduce this paper and assess the weight of evidence using an a priori probabilistic assessment of Viswanathan Anand and the streak evidence of Kramnik. Our analysis shows that Nakamura has a 99.6 percent chance of not cheating given Anand’s prior assumptions.\nWe start by addressing the argument of Kramnik which is based on the fact that the probability of such a streak is very small. This falls into precisely the Prosecutor’s Fallacy. Let’s introduce the notations. We denote by \\(G\\) the event of being guilty and \\(I\\) the event of innocence. We use \\(E\\) to denote evidence. In our case the evidence is the streak of wins by Nakamura. Kramnik’s argument is that the probability of observing the streak is very low, thus we might have a case of cheating. This is the prosecutor’s fallacy \\[\nP(I \\mid E) \\neq P(E \\mid I).\n\\] Kramnik’s calculations neglect other relevant factors, such as the prior probability of cheating. The prosecutor’s fallacy can lead to an overestimation of the strength of the evidence and may result in an unjust conviction. In the cheating problem, at the top level of chess the prior probability of \\(P(G)\\) is small! According to a recent statement by Viswanathan Anand, the probability of cheating is \\(1/10000\\).\n\n\n\nAnand’s Prior\n\n\nGiven the prior ratio of cheaters to not cheaters is \\(1/N\\), meaning out of \\(N+1\\) players, there is one cheater, the Bayes calculations require two main terms. The first one is the prior odds of guilt: \\[\nO ( G ) = P (I) / P ( G ).\n\\] Here \\(P(I)\\) and \\(P(G)\\) are the prior probabilities of innocence and guilt respectively.\nThe second term is the Bayes factor, which is the ratio of the probability of the evidence under the guilt hypothesis to the probability of the evidence under the innocence hypothesis. The Bayes factor is given by \\[\n    L(E\\mid G) = \\frac{P(E\\mid I)}{P(E\\mid G)}.\n\\]\nThe product of the Bayes factor and the prior odds is the posterior odds of guilt, given the evidence. The posterior odds of guilt is given by \\[\n    O(G\\mid E) = O(G) \\times L(E\\mid G).\n\\]\nThe odds of guilt is \\[\n    O ( G )  = \\dfrac{N/(N+1)}{1/(N+1)} = N.\n\\]\nThe Bayes factor is given by \\[\n\\frac{P(E\\mid I)}{P(E\\mid G)} = \\dfrac{p}{1} = p.\n\\] Thus, the posterior odds of guilt are \\[\n    O(G\\mid E) = Np.\n\\] There are two numbers we need to estimate to calculate the odds of cheating given the evidence, namely the prior probability of cheating given via \\(N\\) and the probability of a streak \\(p = P(E\\mid I)\\).\nThere are multiple ways to calculate the probability of a streak. We can use the binomial distribution, the negative binomial distribution, or the Poisson distribution. The binomial distribution is the most natural choice. The probability of a streak of \\(k\\) wins in a row is given by \\[\n    P(E\\mid I) = \\binom{N}{k} q^k (1-q)^{N-k}.\n\\] Here \\(q\\) is the probability of winning a single game. Thus, for a streak of 45 wins in a row, we have \\(k = 45\\) and \\(N = 46\\). We encode the outcome of a game as \\(1\\) for a win and \\(0\\) for a loss or a draw. The probability of a win is \\(q = 0.8916\\) (Nakamura’s Estimate, he reported on his YouTube channel). The probability of a streak is then 0.029. The individual game win probability is calculated from the ELO rating difference between the players.\nThe ELO rating of Hikaru is 3300 and the average ELO rating of his opponents is 2950, according to Kramnik. The difference of 350 corresponds to the odds of winning of \\(wo = 10^{350/400} = 10^{0.875} = 7.2\\). The probability of winning a single game is \\(q = wo/(1+wo) = 0.8916\\).\nThen we use Anand’s prior of \\(N = 10000\\) to get the posterior odds of cheating given the evidence of a streak of 45 wins in a row. The posterior odds of being innocent are 285. The probability of cheating is then \\[\nP(G\\mid E) = 1/(1+O(G\\mid E)) = 0.003491.\n\\] Therefore the probability of innocence \\[\n    P(I\\mid E) = \\frac{Np}{Np+1} = 0.9965.\n\\]\nFor completeness, we perform sensitivity analysis and also get the odds of not cheating for \\(N = 500\\), which should be a high prior probability given the status of the player and the importance of the event. We get \\[\n    P(I\\mid E) = \\frac{Np}{Np+1} = 0.9445.\n\\]\nThere are several assumptions we made in this analysis.\n\nInstead of calculating game-by-game probability of winning, we used the average probability of winning of 0.8916, provided by Nakamura himself. This is a reasonable assumption given the fact that Nakamura is a much stronger player than his opponents. This assumption slightly shifts posterior odds in favor of not cheating. Due to Jensen’s inequality, we have \\(E(q^{50}) &gt; E(q)^{50}\\). Expected value of the probability of winning a single game is \\(E(q) = 0.8916\\) and the expected value of the probability of a streak of 50 wins is \\(E(q^{50})\\). We consider the difference between the two to be small. Further, there is some correlation between the games, which also shifts the posterior odds in favor of not cheating. For example, some players are on tilt. Given they lost the first game, they are more likely to lose the second game.\nThere are many ways to win 3+0 unlike in classical chess. For example, one can win on time. We argue that the probability of winning calculated from the ELO rating difference is underestimated.\n\nNext, we can use the Bayes analysis to solve an inverse problem and to find what prior you need to assume and how long of a sequence you need to observe to get 0.99 posterior? Small sample size, we have \\(p\\) close to 1. Figure 2.1 shows the combination of prior (\\(N\\)) and the probability of a streak (\\(p\\)) that gives posterior odds of 0.99.\nIndeed, the results of the Bayesian analysis contradict the results of a traditional p-value based approach. A p-value is a measure used in frequentist statistical hypothesis testing. It represents the probability of obtaining the observed results, or results more extreme, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. The null hypothesis is a default position that Nakamura is not cheating and we compare the ELO-based expected win probability of \\(q=0.8916\\) to the observed one of \\(s=45/46=0.978\\). Under the null hypothesis, Nakamura should perform at the level predicted by \\(q\\).\n\nq = 0.8916\np = dbinom(45,46,q)\nN = 10000\nodds = p*N\nprint(1-1/(1+odds))\n\n 1\n\nprint(1/(1+odds))\n\n 0.0035\n\nprint(N*p/(N*p+1))\n\n 1\n\n\n\np = seq(from=0.006, to=0.07, length.out=500)\nN = seq(500,10000, by=250)\nplot(99/N,N,xlab=\"p\", ylab=\"N\", type='l', lwd=3, col=\"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The combination of prior (\\(N\\)) and the probability of a streak (\\(p\\)) that gives posterior odds of 0.99.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Hume discussed the problem similar to the Island problem in his “On Miracles” essay. Hume is making the following argument on miracles:\n\n“…no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous, than the fact, which it endeavors to establish; and even in that case there is a mutual destruction of arguments, and the superior only gives us an assurance suitable to that degree of force, which remains, after deducting the inferior.”\n\nOne can view this as an application of the Island problem. Assuming the probability of a miracle \\(A\\) is \\(p( A) = p\\) and \\(p( not \\; A ) = 1 -p\\). Then Bayes rule gives \\[\np( A| a ) = \\frac{ p( a| A) p }{  p( a| A) p  +  p( a |  not \\; A) (1-p) }  \n\\] Prosecutor’s fallacy, \\(p( a| not \\; A)  \\neq 1 -  p( a| A)\\), in general.\nIn Hume’s assessment of miracles (has to be something not in the laws of nature) we have \\(p(A) = 10^{-6}\\). This assessment takes into account background information, \\(I\\). Rare to have a contradiction to the laws of nature. More informative to write \\(p( A | I )\\). Furthermore, we take \\(p( a| A) =0.99\\). The hardest bit is to assess \\(p(a | not \\; A )\\). The “frequency” of faked miracles and mankind’s propensity to be marvelous. We assess \\(p(a | not \\; A )  = 10^{-3}\\). This yields the chance of a miracle to be unlikely as \\[\np( A| a ) = \\frac{ 0.99 \\times 10^{-6}  }{  0.99 \\times 10^{-6}    +  10^{-3} (1- 10^{-6}) }   \\approx 10^{-3}.\n\\] Feynman considers the inverse problem: can we learn the laws of nature purely from empirical observation? Uses chess as an example. Is it a miracle that we have two bishops of the same color? No! according to Hume. We just didn’t know the laws of nature (a.k.a. model).\n\nExample 2.14 (Sally Clark Case: Independence or Bayes Rule?) To show that independence can lead to dramatically different results from Bayes conditional probabilities, consider the Sally Clark case. Sally Clark was accused and convicted of killing her two children who could have both died of SIDS. One explanation is that this was a random occurrence, the other one is that they both died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). How can we use conditional probability to figure out a reasonable assessment of the probability that she murdered her children. First, some known probability assessments\n\nThe chance of a family of non-smokers having a SIDS death is \\(1\\) in \\(8,500\\).\nThe chance of a second SIDS death is \\(1\\) in \\(100\\).\nThe chance of a mother killing her two children is around \\(1\\) in \\(1,000,000\\).\n\nUnder Bayes \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\prob{\\mathrm{both} \\; \\; \\mathrm{SIDS}}   &  = \\prob{\\mathrm{first} \\; \\mathrm{SIDS}} \\prob{\\mathrm{Second} \\; \\;\\mathrm{SIDS} \\mid \\mathrm{first} \\; \\mathrm{SIDS}}\\\\\n&  = \\frac{1}{8500} \\cdot \\frac{1}{100} = \\frac{1}{850,000}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe \\(1/100\\) comes from taking into account the genetic properties of SIDS. Independence, as implemented by the court, gets you to a probabilistic assessment of \\[\nP \\left(  \\mathrm{both} \\; \\; \\mathrm{SIDS} \\right)  = (1/8500) (1/8500) = (1/73,000,000).\n\\] This is a low probability. It is still not the answer to our question of context. We need a conditional probability, this will come to the Bayes rule.\nFirst, some general comment on the likelihood ratio calculation used to assess the weight of evidence in favor of guilty v.s. innocent evidence. Under Bayes we’ll find that there’s reasonable evidence that she’d be acquitted. We need the relative odds ratio. Let \\(I\\) denote the event that Sally Clark is innocent and \\(G\\) denotes guilty. Let \\(E\\) denote the evidence. In most cases, \\(E\\) contains a sequence \\(E_1, E_2, \\ldots\\) of ‘facts’ and we have to use the likelihood ratios in turn. Bayes rule then tells you to combine via multiplicative fashion. If likelihood ratio \\(&gt;1\\), odds of guilty. If likelihood ratio \\(&lt;1\\), more likelihood to be \\(I\\). By Bayes rule \\[\n\\frac{p(I\\mid E)}{p(G\\mid E)} = \\frac{p( E\\text{ and } I)}{p( E\\text{ and } G)}.\n\\] If we further decompose \\(p(E \\text{ and } I) = p(E\\mid I )p(I)\\) then we have to discuss the prior probability of innocence, namely \\(p(I)\\). Hence this is one subtle advantage of the above decomposition.\nThe underlying intuition that Bayes gives us in this example, is that of the two possible explanations of the data, both of which are unlikely, it is the relative likelihood comparison that should matter. Here is a case where the \\(p\\)-value would be non-sensible (\\(p(E\\mid I) \\neq p(I\\mid E)\\)). Effectively comparing two rare event probabilities from the two possible models or explanations.\nHence putting these two together gives the odds of guilt as \\[\n\\frac{p(I\\mid E)}{p(G\\mid E)} = \\frac{1/850,000}{1/1,000,000} = 1.15.\n\\] Solving for the posterior probability yields \\(46.5\\%\\) for probability of guilty given evidence. \\[\np( G\\mid E) = \\frac{1}{1 + O(G\\mid E)} = 0.465.\n\\] Basically a \\(50/50\\) bet. Not enough to definitively convict! But remember that our initial prior probability on guilt \\(p(G)\\) was \\(10^{-6}\\). So now there has been a dramatic increase to a posterior probability of \\(0.465\\). So it’s not as if Bayes rule thinks this is evidence in the suspect’s favor – but the magnitude is still not in the \\(0.999\\) range though, where most jurors would have to be to feel comfortable with a guilt verdict.\nIf you use the “wrong” model of independence (as the court did) you get \\[\nP \\left(  \\mathrm{both} \\; \\; \\mathrm{SIDS} \\right)  = \\frac{1}{8500}\n  \\cdot\\frac{1}{8500} = \\frac{1}{73,000,000}.\n\\] With the independence assumption, you make the assessment \\[\n\\frac{p(I\\mid E)}{p(G\\mid E)} = \\frac{1}{73} \\; \\mathrm{ and} \\; p( G\\mid E) \\approx 0.99.\n\\] Given these probability assumptions, the suspect looks guilty with probability 99%.\nExperts also mis-interpret the evidence by saying: 1 in 73 million chance that it is someone else. This is clearly false and misleading to the jury and has led to appeals.\n\n\nExample 2.15 (O. J. Simpson Case: Dershowitz Fallacy)  \n\nThis example is based on I. J. Good’s, “When batterer turns murderer.” Nature, 15 June 1995, p. 541. Alan Dershowitz, on the O. J. Simpson defense team, stated on T.V. and in newspapers that only 1 in 2,500 of men who abuse their wives go on to murder them. He clearly wanted his audience to interpret this to mean that the evidence of abuse by Simpson would only suggest a 0.04% probability of his being guilty of murdering her. He used probability to argue that because so few husbands who batter their wives actually go on to murder their wives. Thus, O.J. is highly likely to be not guilty. This leaves out the most relevant conditioning information that we also know that Nicole Brown Simpson was actually murdered. Both authors believe the jury would be more interested in the probability that the husband is guilty of the murder of his wife given that he abused his wife and his wife was murdered. They both solve this problem by using Bayes’ theorem.\nIn this example, the notation \\(B\\) represents “woman battered by her husband, boyfriend, or lover”, \\(M\\) represents the event “woman murdered”, and \\(G\\) denotes “woman murdered by her batterer”. Our goal is to show that \\[\n% P(M,B \\mid M) \\neq P(M,B \\mid B).\nP(G \\mid M,B) \\neq P(G\\mid B).\n\\]\nIt is not hard to come to a wrong conclusion if you don’t take into account all the relevant conditional information. He intended this information to exonerate O.J. In 1992 the women population of the US was 125 million and 4936 women were murdered, thus \\[\nP(M) = 4936/125,000,000 = 0.00004 = 1/25,000.\n\\] At the same year about 3.5 million women were battered \\[\nP(B) = 3.5/125 = 0.028.\n\\] That same year 1432 women were murdered by their previous batterers, so the marginal probability of that event is \\(P(G) = 1432/125,000,000 = 0.00001 = 1/87,290\\), and the conditional probability, \\(P(G | B)\\) is 1432 divided by 3.5 million, or \\(1/2444\\). These are the numbers Dershowitz used to obtain his estimate that about 1 in 2500 battered women go on to be murdered by their batterers.\nWe need to calculate \\[\nP(G \\mid M,B) = P(M | G,B) P(G) / P(M).\n\\] We know \\(P(M | G,B) = 1\\) and \\(P(G) / P(M) = 0.00001/0.00004 = 0.29\\), or about 1 in 3.5.\nAlan Dershowitz provided the jury with an accurate but irrelevant probability. The fact the woman was murdered increases the probability that she was murdered by her batterer by a factor of 709 (0.29/(1/2444)). \\[\nP(G\\mid M,B)\\approx 709\\times P(G\\mid B).\n\\]\nThe argument used by Dershowitz relating to the Simpson case has been discussed by John Paulos in an op-ed article in the Philadelphia Inquirer (15 Oct. 1995, C7) and his book “Once Upon a Number”, by I.J. Good in an article in Nature (June 15,1995, p 541) and by Jon Merz and Jonathan Caulkins in an article in Chance Magazine, (Spring 1995, p 14).\n\nProbability measures the uncertainty of an event. But how do we measure probability? One school of thought takes probability as subjective, namely personal to the observer. de Finetti famously concluded that “Probability does not exist.” Measuring that is personal to the observer. It’s not like mass which is a property of an object. If two different observers have differing “news” then there is an opportunity for them to bet (exchange contracts). Thus leading to an assessment of probability. Ramsey (1926) takes this view.\nMuch of data science is then the art of building probability models to study phenomena. For many events most people will agree on their probabilities, for example \\(p(H) = 0.5\\) and \\(p(T) = 0.5\\). In the subjective view of probability we can measure or elicit a personal probability as a “willingness to play”. Namely, will you be willing to bet $1 so you can get $2 if the coin lands Tail and $0 if Head occurs? For more details, see Chapter 4.",

    "text": "2.4 Sensitivity and Specificity\nConditional probabilities are used to define two fundamental metrics used for many probabilistic and statistical learning models, namely sensitivity and specificity.\nSensitivity and specificity are two key metrics used to evaluate the performance of diagnostic tests, classification models, or screening tools. These metrics help assess how well a test can correctly identify individuals with a condition (true positives) and those without the condition (true negatives). Let’s break down each term:\n\nSensitivity (true‐positive rate or recall) is the ability of a test \\(T\\) to correctly identify individuals who have a particular condition or disease (\\(D\\)), \\(P ( T=1 \\mid D=1 )\\), the probability of a positive test given that the individual has the disease. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. \\[\np(T=1\\mid D=1) = \\dfrac{p(T=1,D=1)}{p(D=1)}.\n\\] A high sensitivity indicates that the test is good at identifying individuals with the condition, minimizing false negatives.\nSpecificity (true‐negative rate) is the ability of a test to correctly identify individuals who do not have a particular condition or disease, \\(P (T=0 \\mid D=0 )\\). It is calculated as the ratio of true negatives to the sum of true negatives and false positives. \\[\np(T=0\\mid D=0) = \\dfrac{p(T=0,D=0)}{p(D=0)}\n\\] A high specificity indicates that the test is good at correctly excluding individuals without the condition, minimizing false positives.\n\nSensitivity and specificity are often trade-offs. Increasing sensitivity might decrease specificity, and vice versa. Thus, depending on the application, you might prefer sensitivity over specificity or vice versa, depending on the consequences of false positives and false negatives in a particular application.\nConsider a medical test designed to detect a certain disease. If the test has high sensitivity, it means that it is good at correctly identifying individuals with the disease. On the other hand, if the test has high specificity, it is good at correctly identifying individuals without the disease. The goal is often to strike a balance between sensitivity and specificity based on the specific needs and implications of the test results.\n\nSensitivity is often called the power of a procedure (a.k.a. test). There are two kinds of errors (type I and type II) as well as sensitivity and specificity are dual concepts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType I error (false positive rate)\n\n\n\nis the percentage of healthy people who tested positive, \\(P(T=1\\mid D=0)\\), it is the mistake of thinking something is true when it is not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType II error (or false negative rate)\n\n\n\nis the percentage of sick people who are tested negative, \\(P(T=0\\mid D=1)\\), it is the mistake of thinking something is not true when in fact it is true.\n\n\nWe would like to control both conditional probabilities with our test. Also if someone tests positive, how likely is it that they actually have the disease. There are two ‘errors’ one can make. Falsely diagnosing someone, or not correctly finding the disease.\nIn the stock market, one can think of type I error as not selling a losing stock quickly enough, and a type II error as failing to buy a growing stock, e.g. Amazon or Google.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(p(T=1\\mid D=1)\\)\nSensitivity\nTrue Positive Rate\n\\(1-\\beta\\)\n\n\n\\(p(T=0\\mid D=0 )\\)\nSpecificity\nTrue Negative Rate\n\\(1-\\alpha\\)\n\n\n\\(p(T=1\\mid D=0)\\)\n1-Specificity\nFalse Positive Rate\n\\(\\alpha\\) (type I error)\n\n\n\\(p(T=0\\mid D =1)\\)\n1-Sensitivity\nFalse Negative Rate\n\\(\\beta\\) (type II error)\n\n\n\nOften it is convenient to write those four values in the form of a two-by-two matrix, called the confusion matrix:\n\n\n\nActual/Predicted\nPositive\nNegative\n\n\n\n\nPositive\nTP\nFN\n\n\nNegative\nFP\nTN\n\n\n\nwhere: TP: True Positive.

These examples illustrate why people can commonly miscalculate and mis-interpret probabilities. Those quantities can be calculated using the Bayes rule.\n\nExample 2.16 (Apple Watch Series 4 ECG and Bayes’ Theorem) The Apple Watch Series 4 can perform a single-lead ECG and detect atrial fibrillation. The software can correctly identify 98% of cases of atrial fibrillation (true positives) and 99% of cases of non-atrial fibrillation (true negatives) (Kim et al. 2024; Bumgarner et al. 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredicted\natrial fibrillation\nno atrial fibrillation\nTotal\n\n\n\n\natrial fibrillation\n1960\n980\n2940\n\n\nno atrial fibrillation\n40\n97020\n97060\n\n\nTotal\n2000\n98000\n100000\n\n\n\nHowever, what is the probability of a person having atrial fibrillation when atrial fibrillation is identified by the Apple Watch Series 4? We use Bayes theorem to answer this question. \\[\np(\\text{atrial fibrillation}\\mid \\text{atrial fibrillation is identified }) = \\frac{0.01960}{ 0.02940} = 0.6667\n\\]\nThe conditional probability of having atrial fibrillation when the Apple Watch Series 4 detects atrial fibrillation is about 67%.\nApple Watch’s positive predictive value is just 19.6 percent. That means in this group – which constitutes more than 90 percent of users of wearable devices like the Apple Watch – the app incorrectly diagnoses atrial fibrillation 79.4 percent of the time. (You can try the calculation yourself using this Bayesian calculator: enter 0.001 for prevalence, 0.98 for sensitivity, and 0.996 for specificity).\nThe electrocardiogram app becomes more reliable in older individuals: The positive predictive value is 76 percent among users between the ages of 60 and 64, 91 percent among those aged 70 to 74, and 96 percent for those older than 85.\nIn the case of medical diagnostics, the sensitivity is the ratio of people who have disease and tested positive to the total number of positive cases in the population \\[\np(T=1\\mid D=1) = \\dfrac{p(T=1,D=1)}{p(D=1)} = 0.019/0.002 = 0.95\n\\] The specificity is given by \\[\np(T=0\\mid D=0) = \\dfrac{p(T=0,D=0)}{p(D=0)} = 0.9702/0.98 = 0.99.\n\\] As we see the test is highly sensitive and specific. However, only 66% of those who are tested positive will have a disease. This is due to the fact that the number of sick people is much less than the number of healthy and presence of type I error.",

    "text": "2.5 Graphical Representation of Probability and Conditional Independence.\n\nWe can use the telescoping property of conditional probabilities to write the joint probability distribution as a product of conditional probabilities. This is the essence of the chain rule of probability. It is given by \\[\np(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n) = p(x_1)p(x_2 \\mid x_1)p(x_3 \\mid x_1, x_2) \\ldots p(x_n \\mid x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{n-1}).\n\\] The expression on the right hand side can be simplified if some of the variables are conditionally independent. For example, if \\(x_3\\) is conditionally independent of \\(x_2\\), given \\(x_1\\), then we can write \\[\np(x_3 \\mid x_1, x_2) =p(x_3 \\mid x_1).\n\\]\nIn a high-dimensional case, when we have a joint distribution over a large number of random variables, we can often simplify the expression by using independence or conditional independence assumptions. Sometimes it is convenient to represent these assumptions in a graphical form. This is the idea behind the concept of a Bayesian network. Essentially, the graph is a compact representation of a set of independencies that hold in the distribution.\nLet’s consider an example of joint distribution with three random variables, we have the following joint distribution: \\[\np(a,b,c) = p(a\\mid b,c)p(b\\mid c)p(c)\n\\]\nGraphically, we can represent the relations between the variables known as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which is known as a Bayesian network. Each node represents a random variable and the arrows represent the conditional dependencies between the variables. When two nodes are connected they are not independent. Consider the following three cases:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\np(b\\mid c,a) = p(b\\mid c),~ p(a,b,c) = p(a)p(c\\mid a)p(b\\mid c)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nLine Structure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\np(a\\mid b,c) = p(a\\mid c), ~ p(a,b,c) = p(a\\mid c)p(b\\mid c)p(c)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nLambda Structure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\np(a\\mid b) = p(a),~ p(a,b,c) = p(c\\mid a,b)p(a)p(b)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nV-structure\n\n\n\nAlthough the graph shows us the conditional independence assumptions, we can also derive other independencies from the graph. An interesting question is whether they are connected through a third node. In the first case (a), we have \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) connected through \\(c\\). Thus, \\(a\\) can influence \\(b\\). However, once \\(c\\) is known, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent. In case (b) the logic here is similar, \\(a\\) can influence \\(b\\) through \\(c\\), but once \\(c\\) is known, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent. In the third case (c), \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent, but once \\(c\\) is known, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not independent. You can formally derive these independencies from the graph by comparing \\(p(a,b\\mid c)\\) and \\(p(a\\mid c)p(b\\mid c)\\).\n\nExample 2.17 (Bayes Home Diagnostics) Suppose that a house alarm system sends me a text notification when some motion inside my house is detected. It detects motion when I have a person inside (burglar) or during an earthquake. Say, from prior data we know that during an earthquake alarm is triggered in 10% of the cases. Once I receive a text message, I start driving back home. While driving I hear on the radio about a small earthquake in our area. Now we want to know \\(p(b \\mid a)\\) and \\(p(b \\mid a,r)\\). Here \\(b\\) = burglary, \\(e\\) = earthquake, \\(a\\) = alarm, and \\(r\\) = radio message about small earthquake.\nThe joint distribution is then given by \\[\n  p(b,e,a,r) = p(r \\mid a,b,e)p(a \\mid b,e)p(b\\mid e)p(e).\n\\] Since we know the causal relations, we can simplify this expression \\[\np(b,e,a,r) = p(r \\mid e)p(a \\mid b,e)p(b)p(e).\n\\] The \\(p(a \\mid b,e)\\) distribution is defined by\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Conditional probability of alarm given burglary and earthquake\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(p(a=1 \\mid b,e)\\)\nb\ne\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n0.1\n0\n1\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphically, we can represent the relations between the variables known as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which is known as a Bayesian network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph TB\n    b((b)) --&gt; a((a))\n    e((e)) --&gt; a\n    e --&gt; r((r))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Bayesian network for alarm\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can easily calculate \\(p(a=0 \\mid b,e)\\), from the property of a probability distribution \\(p(a=1 \\mid b,e) + p(a=0 \\mid b,e) = 1\\). In addition, we are given \\(p(r=1 \\mid e=1) = 0.5\\) and \\(p(r=1 \\mid e=0) = 0\\). Further, based on historic data we have \\(p(b) = 2\\cdot10^{-4}\\) and \\(p(e) = 10^{-2}\\). Note that causal relations allowed us to have a more compact representation of the joint probability distribution. The original naive representation requires specifying \\(2^4\\) parameters.\nTo answer our original question, calculate \\[\np(b \\mid a) = \\dfrac{p(a \\mid b)p(b)}{p(a)},~~p(a) = p(a=1 \\mid b=1)p(b=1) + p(a=1 \\mid b=0)p(b=0).\n\\] We have everything but \\(p(a \\mid b)\\). This is obtained by marginalizing \\(p(a=1 \\mid b,e)\\), to yield \\[\np(a \\mid b) = p(a \\mid b,e=1)p(e=1) + p(a \\mid b,e=0)p(e=0).\n\\] We can calculate \\[\np(a=1 \\mid b=1) = 1, ~p(a=1 \\mid b=0) = 0.1*10^{-2} + 0 = 10^{-3}.\n\\] This leads to \\(p(b \\mid a) = 2\\cdot10^{-4}/(2\\cdot10^{-4} + 10^{-3}(1-2\\cdot10^{-4})) = 1/6\\).\nThis result is somewhat counterintuitive. We get such a low probability of burglary because its prior is very low compared to the prior probability of an earthquake. What will happen to the posterior if we live in an area with higher crime rates, say \\(p(b) = 10^{-3}\\). Figure 2.3 shows the relationship between the prior and posterior. \\[\np(b \\mid a) = \\dfrac{p(b)}{p(b) + 10^{-3}(1-p(b))}\n\\]\n\nprior &lt;- seq(0, .1, length.out = 200)\npost &lt;- prior / (prior + 0.001 * (1 - prior))\nplot(prior, post, type = \"l\", lwd = 3, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Relationship between the prior and posterior\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, suppose that you hear on the radio about a small earthquake while driving. Then, using Bayesian conditioning, \\[\np(b=1 \\mid a=1,r=1) =  \\dfrac{p(a,r  \\mid  b)p(b)}{p(a,r)}\n\\] and \\[\np(a,r  \\mid  b)p(b) = \\dfrac{\\sum_e p(b=1,e,a=1,r=1)}{\\sum_b\\sum_ep(b,e,a=1,r=1)}\n\\] \\[\n=\\dfrac{\\sum_ep(r=1 \\mid e)p(a=1 \\mid b=1,e)p(b=1)p(e)}{\\sum_b\\sum_ep(r=1 \\mid e)p(a=1 \\mid b,e)p(b)p(e)}\n\\] which is \\(\\approx 2\\%\\) in our case. This effect is called explaining away, namely when new information explains some previously known fact.\n\n\n\n\n\nBumgarner, John M., Chad T. Lambert, Ayman A. Hussein, Daniel J.

    "text": "3.1 Exchangeability and the Bayesian view of probability models\nStatistics makes use of parametric families of distributions and assumes that observed samples \\(y = (y_1,\\ldots,y_n)\\) are independent and identically distributed observations from a distribution with density function parametrized by \\(\\theta\\), the notation is \\(y \\sim p(y \\mid \\theta)\\). The functional form of \\(p(y \\mid \\theta)\\) is assumed to be known, but the value of \\(\\theta\\) is unknown. The goal of statistical inference is to estimate \\(\\theta\\) from the observed data \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\). There are several tasks in statistical inference, including\nThe main tasks in statistical inference include estimation, hypothesis testing, and prediction. Estimation involves using the observed sample to infer the value of the unknown parameter \\(\\theta\\), either by providing a single best guess (denoted as \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\)) or by constructing an interval \\([a, b]\\) that is likely to contain the true value of \\(\\theta\\) with a specified probability. Hypothesis testing focuses on evaluating specific claims or hypotheses about the value of \\(\\theta\\); for instance, we might be interested in determining whether \\(\\theta\\) is equal to a particular value \\(\\theta_0\\). Prediction, on the other hand, is concerned with forecasting the value of a future observation \\(y_{n+1}\\) based on the data already observed, \\(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\) via a model \\(p(y_{n+1} \\mid y_1, \\ldots, y_n)\\).\nIn this section we present a general framework for statistical inference, known as Bayesian inference, which is based on the use of probability distributions to represent uncertainty and make inferences about unknown parameters. We will use Bayes rule to update our beliefs about the parameters of a model based on new evidence or data. Bayesian inference provides a principled approach to statistical modeling and decision-making, and is widely used in various fields such as machine learning, econometrics, and engineering.\nIn the context of artificial intelligence and statistical modeling, Bayesian parameter learning is particularly relevant when dealing with models that have uncertain or unknown parameters. The goal is to update the probability distribution over the parameters of the model as new data becomes available. Suppose that you are interested in the values of k unknown quantities \\[\n\\theta = (\\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_k)\n\\]\nThe basic steps involved in Bayesian parameter learning include:\nThe key advantage of Bayesian parameter learning is its ability to incorporate prior knowledge and update beliefs based on observed data in a principled manner. It provides a framework for handling uncertainty and expressing the confidence or ambiguity associated with parameter estimates. However, it often requires computational methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or variational inference, to approximate or sample from the complex posterior distributions.\nBayes rule allows us to combine the prior distribution and the likelihood function \\[\n\\text{Posterior} = \\frac{\\text{Likelihood} \\times \\text{Prior}}{\\text{Marginal}}.\n\\]\nOften, Bayesian analysis can be performed without calculating the marginal likelihood, in this case we omit the total probability in the denominator on the right hand side and write Bayes rule as \\[\n\\text{Posterior} \\propto \\text{Likelihood} \\times \\text{Prior}.\n\\]\nThe choice of prior distribution can significantly impact the ease of computation and the interpretation of the posterior distribution. Conjugate priors are a special type of prior distribution that, when combined with a specific likelihood function, result in a posterior distribution that belongs to the same family as the prior. This property simplifies the computation of the posterior distribution, and allows for analytical solutions.\nCommon examples of conjugate priors include:\nUsing conjugate priors simplifies the Bayesian analysis, especially in cases where analytical solutions are desirable. However, the choice of a conjugate prior is often a modeling assumption, and in some cases, non-conjugate priors may be more appropriate for capturing the true underlying uncertainty in the problem. The blind use of conjugate priors can lead to misleading results. We should never ignore the absence of evidence for use of a specific model.\nAt the basis of all statistical problems is a potential sample of data, \\(y=\\left( y_{1},\\ldots,y_{T}\\right)\\), and assumptions over the data generating process such as independence, a model or models, and parameters. How should one view the relationship between models, parameters, and samples of data? How should one define a model and parameters? These questions have fundamental implications for statistical inference and can be answered from different perspectives. We will discuss de Finetti’s representation theorem which provides a formal connection between data, models, and parameters.\nTo understand the issues, consider the simple example of an experiment consisting of tosses of a simple thumb tack in ideal “laboratory” conditions. The outcome of the experiment can be defined as a random variable \\(y_{i},\\) where \\(y_{i}=1\\) if the \\(i^{th}\\) toss was a heads (the tack lands on the spike portion) and \\(y_{i}=0\\) if the tack lands tails (on its flat portion). How do we model these random variables? The frequentist or objective approach assumes tosses are independent and identically distributed. In this setting, independence implies that \\[\nP\\left(  y_{2}=1,y_{1}=1\\right)  =P\\left(  y_{2}=1\\right)\nP\\left(  y_{1}=1\\right).\n\\]\nGiven this, are thumbtack tosses independent? Surprisingly, the answer is no. Or at least absolutely not under the current assumptions. Independence implies that \\[\nP\\left(  y_{2}=1 \\mid y_{1}=1\\right)  =P\\left(  y_{2}=1\\right),\n\\] which means that observing \\(y_{1}=1\\) does not affect the probability that \\(y_{2}=1\\). To see the implications of this simple fact, suppose that the results of 500 tosses were available. If the tosses were independent, then \\[\nP\\left(  y_{501}=1\\right)  =P\\left(  y_{501}=1\\mid {\\textstyle\\sum\\nolimits_{t=1}^{500}}y_{t}=1\\right)  =P\\left(  y_{501}=1\\mid {\\textstyle\\sum\\nolimits_{t=1}^{500}}y_{t}=499\\right).\n\\] It is hard to imagine that anyone would believe this–nearly every observer would state that the second probability is near zero and the third probability is near 1 as the first 500 tosses contain a lot of information. Thus, the tosses are not independent.\nTo see the resolution of this apparent paradox, introduce a parameter, \\(\\theta\\), which is the probability that a thumb tack toss is heads. If \\(\\theta\\) were known, then it is true that, conditional on the value of this parameter, the tosses are independent and \\[\nP\\left(  y_{2}=1\\mid y_{1}=1,\\theta\\right)  =P\\left(y_{2}=1\\mid \\theta\\right)  =\\theta.\n\\] Thus, the traditional usage of independence, and independent sampling, requires that “true” parameter values are known. With unknown probabilities, statements about future tosses are heavily influenced by previous observations, clearly violating the independence assumption. Ironically, if the data was really independent, we would not need samples in the first place to estimate parameters because the probabilities would already be known! Given this, if you were now presented with a thumb tack from a box that was to be repeatedly tossed, do you think that the tosses are independent?\nThis example highlights the tenuous foundations, an odd circularity, and the internal inconsistency of the frequentist approach that proceeds under the assumption of a fixed “true” parameter. All frequentist procedures are founded on the assumption of known parameter values: sampling distributions of estimators are computed conditional on \\(\\theta\\); confidence intervals consist of calculations of the form: \\(P\\left( f\\left( y_{1}, \\ldots ,y_{T}\\right) \\in\\left( a,b\\right) |\\theta\\right)\\); and asymptotics also all rely on the assumption of known parameter values. None of these calculations are possible without assuming the known parameters.\nIn the frequentist approach, even though the parameter is completely unknown to the researcher, \\(\\theta\\) is not a random variable, does not have a distribution, and therefore inference is not governed by the rules of probability. Given this “fixed, but unknown” definition, it is impossible to discuss concepts like “parameter uncertainty.” This strongly violates our intuition, since things that are not known are typically thought of as random.\nThe Bayesian approach avoids this internal inconsistency by shedding the strong assumption of independence and assumption of a fixed but unknown parameter. Instead it assumes that \\(\\theta\\) is a random variable and describes the uncertainty about \\(\\theta\\) using a probability distribution, \\(p\\left( \\theta\\right)\\) (the prior). The joint distribution of the data is then \\[\np(y_{1}, \\ldots ,y_{T},\\theta)  = \\int p(y_{1}, \\ldots ,y_{T} \\mid \\theta)  p(\\theta)d\\theta = \\int\\prod_{t=1}^Tp(y_t\\mid \\theta)  p( \\theta)d\\theta.\n\\] Notice, that the right-hand-side does not depend on the order of the data, and the joint distribution of the data is the same for all potential orderings. This is a natural assumption about the symmetry of the data, and is called exchangeability. The Bayesian approach makes no assumptions about the order in which the data may arrive, and each observation has the same marginal distribution, \\(P\\left( y_{i}=1\\right) =P\\left(y_{j}=1\\right)\\) for any \\(i\\) and \\(j\\).\nThus, we replace the independence assumption with a weaker and more natural assumption of exchangeability: a collection of random variables, \\(y_{1}, \\ldots ,y_{T}\\), is exchangeable if the distribution of \\(y_{1}, \\ldots ,y_{T}\\) is the same as the distribution of any permutation \\(y_{\\pi_{1}}, \\ldots ,y_{\\pi_{T}}\\), where \\(\\pi=\\left( \\pi_{1}, \\ldots ,\\pi_{T}\\right)\\) is a permutation of the integers \\(1\\) to \\(T\\). Independent events are always exchangeable, but the converse is not true. Notice the differences between the assumptions in the Bayesian and frequentist approach: the Bayesian makes assumptions over potentially realized data, and there is no need to invent the construct of a fixed but unknown parameter, since exchangeability makes no reference to parameters.\nIn the case of the tack throwing experiment, exchangeability states that the ordering of heads and tails does not matter. Thus, if the experiment of 8 tosses generated 4 heads, it does not matter if the ordering was \\(\\left(1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0\\right)\\) or \\(\\left( 0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1\\right)\\). This is a natural assumption about the symmetry of the tack tosses, capturing the idea that the information in any toss or sequence of tosses is the same as any other–the idea of a truly random sample. It is important to note that exchangeability is a property that applies prior to viewing the data. After observation, data is no longer a random variable, but a realization of a random variable.\nBruno de Finetti introduced the notion of exchangeability, and then asked a simple question: “What do exchangeable sequences of random variables look like?” The answer to this question is given in the famous de Finetti’s theorem, which also defines models, parameters, and provides important linkages between frequentist and classical statistics.",

The theorem is interpreted as follows:\n\nUnder exchangeability, parameters exist, and one can act as if the \\(y_{t}\\)’s are drawn independently from a Bernoulli distribution with parameter \\(\\theta\\). That is, they are draws from the model \\(p\\left(y_{t} \\mid \\theta\\right) =\\theta^{y_{t}}(1-\\theta)^{1-y_{t}},\\) generating a likelihood function \\(p\\left( y \\mid \\theta\\right) =\\prod_{t=1}^{T}p\\left(y_{t} \\mid \\theta\\right)\\). Formally, the likelihood function is defined via the density \\(p\\left( y \\mid \\theta\\right)\\), viewed as a function of \\(\\theta\\) for a fixed sample \\(y=\\left( y_{1}, \\ldots ,y_{T}\\right)\\). More “likely” parameter values generate higher likelihood values, thus the name. The maximum likelihood estimate or MLE is \\[\n\\widehat{\\theta}=\\arg\\underset{\\theta\\in\\Theta}{\\max}\\text{ }p\\left(y \\mid \\theta\\right)  =\\arg\\underset{\\theta\\in\\Theta}{\\max}\\ln p\\left(y \\mid \\theta\\right),   \n\\] where \\(\\Theta\\) is the parameter space.\nParameters are random variables. The limit \\(\\theta=\\underset {T\\rightarrow\\infty}{\\lim}T^{-1}\\sum_{t=1}^{T}y_{t}\\) exists but is a random variable. This can be contrasted with the strong law of large numbers that requires independence and implies that \\(T^{-1}\\sum_{t=1}^{T}y_{t}\\) converges almost surely to a fixed value, \\(\\theta_{0}\\). From this, one can interpret a parameter as a limit of observables and justifies the frequentist interpretation of \\(\\theta\\) as a limiting frequency of 1’s.\nThe distribution \\(P\\left( \\theta\\right)\\) or density \\(p\\left(\\theta\\right)\\) can be interpreted as beliefs about the limiting frequency \\(\\theta\\) prior to viewing the data. After viewing the data, beliefs are updated via Bayes rule resulting in the posterior distribution, \\[\np\\left(  \\theta \\mid y\\right)  \\propto p\\left(  y \\mid \\theta\\right)  p(\\theta).\n\\] Since the likelihood function is fixed in this case, any distribution of observed data can be generated by varying the prior distribution.\n\nThe main implication of de Finetti’s theorem is a complete justification for Bayesian practice of treating the parameters as random variables and specifying a likelihood and parameter distribution. Stated differently, a “model” consists of both a likelihood and a prior distribution over the parameters. Thus, parameters as random variables and priors are a necessity for statistical inference, and not some extraneous component motivated by philosophical concerns.\nMore general versions of de Finetti’s theorem are available. A general version is as follows. If \\(\\left\\{ y_{t}\\right\\} _{t\\geq1}\\), \\(y_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}\\), is a sequence of infinitely exchangeable random variables, then there exists a probability measure \\(P\\) on the space of all distribution functions, such that \\[\np(y_{1},\\ldots,y_{T})=\\int\\prod_{t=1}^{T}F\\left(  y_{t}\\right)\nP(dF)\n\\] with mixing measure \\[\nP\\left(  F\\right)  =\\underset{T\\rightarrow\\infty}{\\lim}P(F_{T}),\n\\] where \\(F_{T}\\) is the empirical distribution of the data. At this level of generality, the distribution function is infinite-dimensional. In practice, additional subjective assumptions are needed that usually restrict the distribution function to finite dimensional spaces, which implies that the distribution function is indexed by a parameter vector \\(\\theta\\): \\[\np(y_{1},\\ldots,y_{T})=\\int\\prod_{t=1}^{T}p\\left(  y_{t} \\mid \\theta\\right)\ndP\\left(  \\theta\\right).\n\\] To operationalize this result, the researcher needs to choose the likelihood function and the prior distribution of the parameters.\nAt first glance, de Finetti’s theorem may seem to suggest that there is a single model or likelihood function. This is not the case however, as models can be viewed in the same manner as parameters. Denoting a model specification by \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), then de Finetti’s theorem would imply that \\[\\begin{align*}\np(y_{1},\\ldots,y_{T})  &  =\\int\\prod_{t=1}^{T}p\\left(  y_{t} \\mid \\theta ,\\mathcal{M}\\right)  p\\left(  \\theta \\mid \\mathcal{M}\\right)  p\\left(\\mathcal{M}\\right)  d\\theta d\\mathcal{M}\\\\\n&  =\\int p(y_{1},\\ldots,y_{T} \\mid \\mathcal{M})p\\left(  \\mathcal{M}\\right)\nd\\mathcal{M},\n\\end{align*}\\] in the case of a continuum of models. Thus, under the mild assumption of exchangeability, it is as if the \\(y_{t}\\)’s are generated from \\(p\\left( y_{t} \\mid \\theta,\\mathcal{M}\\right)\\), conditional on the random variables \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), where \\(p\\left( \\theta \\mid \\mathcal{M}\\right)\\) are the beliefs over \\(\\theta\\) in model \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), and \\(p\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{j}\\right)\\) are the beliefs over model specifications.\nThe objective approach has been a prevailing one in scientific applications. However, it only applies to events that can be repeated under the same conditions a very large number of times. This is rarely the case in many important applied problems. For example, it is hard to repeat an economic event, such as a Federal Reserve meeting or the economic conditions in 2008 infinitely often. This implies that at best, the frequentist approach is limited to laboratory situations. Even in scientific applications, when we attempt to repeat an experiment multiple times, an objective approach is not guaranteed to work. For example, the failure rate of phase 3 clinical trials in oncology is 60% (Shen et al. (2021),Sun et al. (2022)). Prior to phase 3, the drug is usually tested on several hundred patients.\nSubjective probability is a more general definition of probability than the frequentist definition, as it can be used for all types of events, both repeatable and unrepeatable events. A subjectivist has no issues discussing the probability of a lection result, even though the underlying conditions has not been observed before. As Ramsey (1926) puts it, “the probability is simply the willingness to bet on an event with a counterparty”.\nThe event does not even has to be uncertain in nature. For example, the probability of me having coins in my pocket will depend on who is asked to make the assessment. I, knowing the contents of my pocket, will say the probability is 0. However, if you are asked to make the assessment, you will say the probability is 0.5, as you do not know the contents of my pocket. This is a classic example of subjectivist probability.\nSimilarly, consider the number of people currently in Antarctica. This number is fixed and deterministic at any given moment, yet different individuals will assign different probability distributions to this quantity based on their knowledge. A researcher who recently reviewed Antarctic population statistics might have a tight distribution centered around the correct value, while someone with no such knowledge might have a much wider distribution. A logistics coordinator for a polar research station would have precise information about personnel at their specific facility but uncertainty about other stations. Each of these represents valid subjective probabilities over the same underlying fixed quantity, illustrating how probability in the Bayesian sense quantifies personal uncertainty rather than intrinsic randomness.\nThe main difficulty in operationalizing subjective probability is the process of actually quantifying subjective beliefs into numeric probabilities. One practical approach is to elicit probabilities through a sequence of carefully designed bets.\nConsider eliciting someone’s probability distribution over the number of people in Antarctica. We could start by asking: “Would you accept a bet that pays $100 if the number is below 5,000, and you pay $50 if it’s above 5,000?” If they accept, this suggests they believe \\(P(\\text{population} &lt; 5000) &gt; 1/3\\). We then adjust the threshold and payoffs systematically. For instance, we might ask about betting on the population being below 2,000, or below 1,000, gradually narrowing down probability mass at different intervals.\nFor continuous quantities, we can elicit a full distribution through a sequence of binary bets about quantiles. By asking someone to specify values \\(q_{0.25}, q_{0.5}, q_{0.75}\\) such that they are indifferent between bets paying equal amounts if the true value falls below or above each threshold, we construct their 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles. This process, known as probability elicitation, transforms abstract beliefs into concrete probability distributions by observing revealed preferences through betting behavior.\nThe betting framework provides two key advantages. First, it forces coherence: if someone states inconsistent probabilities (such as \\(P(A) + P(\\neg A) \\neq 1\\)), an adversary could construct a Dutch book—a set of bets that guarantees a loss regardless of the outcome. The threat of sure loss incentivizes rational probability assignments. Second, betting naturally handles non-repeatable events. We can elicit probabilities about tomorrow’s Supreme Court decision or next quarter’s GDP growth, neither of which has a frequentist interpretation.\nInstead of using repetitive experiments, subjective probabilities can be measured using betting odds, which have been used for centuries to gauge the uncertainty over an event. The probability attributed to winning a coin toss is revealed by the type of odds one would accept to bet. Notice the difference between the frequentist and Bayesian approach. Instead of defining the probabilities via an infinite repeated experiment, the Bayesian approach elicits probabilities from an individual’s observed behavior.\n\n\nPosterior Empirical CDF\nLet \\(m = \\{ f_\\theta ( y ) : y \\in \\mathcal{Y} \\}\\) be a model. When necessary we index the parameters in model \\(m\\), as \\(\\theta_m\\). Let \\(y = ( y_1 , \\ldots , y_n )\\) be a vector of signals. The conditional likelihood, under \\(m\\), is given by \\(f_\\theta(y) =  \\prod_{i=1}^n f_\\theta ( y_i )\\). We also allow for the possibility that the data is generated from a model \\(f\\) that does not belong to the family of models \\(f_\\theta\\).\nGiven a prior measure, \\(\\Pi ( d F )\\), over \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) the set of distributions, we can calculate the predictive density \\[\nf_n  ( y_{n+1} | y_1 , \\ldots , y_n ) = \\int f (y) \\Pi_n ( d F ) \\; \\text{where}\\; \\Pi_n ( d f ) = \\frac{ \\prod_{i=1}^n f( y_i ) \\Pi( d f ) }{  \\int  \\prod_{i=1}^n f( y_i ) \\Pi( d f ) }\n\\] Under the family, \\(f_\\theta\\), we can calculate the parameter posterior as \\[\np( \\theta | y ) =  \\frac{ \\prod_{i=1}^n f_\\theta ( y_i ) p(\\theta)  d \\theta }{  m(y) } \\;  \\text{where}\\; m(y) = \\int f_\\theta (y) p( \\theta ) d \\theta\n\\] Here \\(p(\\theta)\\) is a prior distribution over parameters and \\(m(y)\\) is the marginal distribution of the data implied by the model. There are many applications in Bayesian non-parametric statistics.",

    "text": "3.2 Sufficient Statistic (Summary Statistic)\nA statistic \\(S(y)\\) is sufficient for \\(\\theta\\), if the conditional distribution of \\(y\\) given \\(S(y)\\) is independent of \\(\\theta\\), namely \\[\np(y\\mid S(y),\\theta) = p(y\\mid S(y)).\n\\] Then, we can view \\(S(y)\\) as a dimension reducing map, as inference for \\(\\theta\\) can be solely determined by \\(S\\). This follows as \\(S(y)\\) is a deterministic map of \\(y\\), so with \\(P(S(y))&gt;0\\), we have \\[\np(y,S(y)\\mid \\theta) = p(y\\mid S(y),\\theta)p(S(y)\\mid \\theta) = p(y\\mid S(y))p(S(y)\\mid \\theta) \\propto p(S(y)\\mid\\theta)\n\\]\nIn Bayesian inference, we need to compute the posterior over unknown model parameters \\(\\theta\\), given data \\(y\\). The posterior density is denoted by \\(p(\\theta \\mid y)\\). Here \\(y = ( y_1 , \\ldots , y_n )\\) is high dimensional. A map from data to a real number or to a low-dimension vector \\[\nS = S(y) = ( S_1(y) , \\ldots , S_k(y) )\n\\] is called a statistic. Since statistic is a deterministic function of the data, then \\[\np(y\\mid \\theta) = p(y,S\\mid \\theta) = p(S\\mid \\theta)p(y\\mid S,\\theta).\n\\] If it happens that the likelihood is conditionally independent on \\(\\theta\\), given \\(S\\) then \\[\np(y\\mid \\theta) = p(S\\mid \\theta)p(y\\mid S).\n\\] In this case the statistic \\(S\\) is called the sufficient statistic for parameter \\(\\theta\\) given data \\(y\\). In other words all the information needed for estimating \\(\\theta\\) is given by \\(S\\).\nThere is a nice connection between the posterior mean and the sufficient statistics, especially minimal sufficient statistics in the exponential family. If there exists a sufficient statistic \\(S^*\\) for \\(\\theta\\), then Kolmogorov (1942) shows that for almost every \\(y\\), \\(p(\\theta\\mid y) = p(\\theta\\mid S^*(y))\\) , and further \\(S(y) = E_{p}(\\theta \\mid y) = E_{p}(\\theta \\mid S^*(y))\\) is a function of \\(S^*(y)\\). In the special case of an exponential family with minimal sufficient statistic \\(S^*\\) and parameter \\(\\theta\\), the posterior mean \\(S(y) = E_{p}(\\theta \\mid y)\\) is a one-to-one function of \\(S^*(y)\\), and thus is a minimal sufficient statistic.\nSummary Statistic: Let \\(S(y)\\) be a sufficient summary statistic in the Bayes sense (Kolmogorov (1942)), if for every prior \\(p\\) \\[\nf_B (y) :=   p_{\\theta \\mid y}(\\theta \\in B\\mid y) = p_{\\theta \\mid s(y)}(\\theta \\in B\\mid s(y)).\n\\] Then we need to use our pattern matching dataset \\((y^{(i)} , \\theta^{(i)})\\) which is simulated from the prior and forward model to “train” the set of functions \\(f_B (y)\\), where we pick the sets \\(B = ( - \\infty , q ]\\) for a quantile \\(q\\). Hence, we can then interpolate in between.\nEstimating the full sequence of functions is then done by interpolating for all Borel sets \\(B\\) and all new data points \\(y\\) using a NN architecture and conditional density NN estimation.\nThe notion of a summary statistic is prevalent in the ABC literature and is tightly related to the notion of a Bayesian sufficient statistic \\(S^*\\) for \\(\\theta\\), then (Kolmogorov 1942), for almost every \\(y\\), \\[\np(\\theta \\mid  Y=y) = p(\\theta \\mid S^*(Y) = S^*(y))\n\\] Furthermore, \\(S(y) = \\mathrm{E}\\left(\\theta \\mid Y = y\\right) = \\mathrm{E}_{p}\\left(\\theta \\mid S^*(Y) = S^*(y)\\right)\\) is a function of \\(S^*(y)\\). In the case of the exponential family, we have \\(S(Y) = \\mathrm{E}_{p}\\left(\\theta | Y \\right)\\) is a one-to-one function of \\(S^*(Y)\\), and thus is a minimal sufficient statistic.\nSufficient statistics are generally kept for parametric exponential families, where \\(S(\\cdot)\\) is given by the specification of the probabilistic model. However, many forward models have an implicit likelihood and no such structures. The generalization of sufficiency is a summary statistic (a.k.a. feature extraction/selection in a neural network). Hence, we make the assumption that there exists a set of features such that the dimensionality of the problem is reduced.\n\nExample 3.1 (Posterior Distribution for Coin Toss) What if we gamble against unfair coin flips or the person who performs the flips is trained to get the side he wants? In this case, we need to estimate the probability of heads \\(\\theta\\) from the data. Suppose we have observed 10 flips \\[\n\\{H, T, H, H, H, T, H, T, H, H\\},\n\\] and only three of them were tails. What is the probability that the next flip will be tail? The frequency-based answer would be \\(3/10 = 0.3\\). However, the Bayes approach gives us more flexibility. Suppose we have a prior belief that the coin is fair, but we are not sure. We can model this belief by a prior distribution. Let’s discretize the variable \\(\\theta\\) and assign prior probabilities to each value of \\(\\theta\\) as follows\n\ntheta &lt;- seq(0, 1, by = 0.1)\nprior = c(0, 0.024, 0.077, 0.132, 0.173, 0.188, 0.173, 0.132, 0.077, 0.024, 0)\nbarplot(prior, names.arg = theta, xlab = \"theta\", ylab = \"prior\")\n\n\n\n\nPrior distribution\n\n\n\n\nWe put most of the mass to the fair assumption (\\(\\theta = 0.5\\)) and zero mass to the extreme values \\(\\theta = 0\\) and \\(\\theta = 1\\). Our mass is exponentially decaying as we move away from 0.5. This is a reasonable assumption, since we are not sure about the fairness of the coin. Now, we can use Bayes rule to update our prior belief. The posterior distribution is given by \\[\np(\\theta \\mid y) = \\frac{p(y \\mid \\theta) p(\\theta)}{p(y)}.\n\\] The denominator is the marginal likelihood, which is given by \\[\np(y) = \\sum_{\\theta} p(y \\mid \\theta) p(\\theta).\n\\] The likelihood is given by the Binomial distribution \\[\np(y \\mid \\theta) \\propto \\theta^3 (1 - \\theta)^7.\n\\] Notice, that the posterior distribution depends only on the number of positive and negative cases. Those numbers are sufficient for the inference about \\(\\theta\\). The posterior distribution is given by\n\nlikelihood &lt;- function(theta, n, Y) {\n  theta^Y * (1 - theta)^(n - Y)\n}\nposterior &lt;- likelihood(theta, 10,3) * prior\nposterior &lt;- posterior / sum(posterior) # normalize\nbarplot(posterior, names.arg = theta, xlab = \"theta\", ylab = \"posterior\")\n\n\n\n\nPosterior distribution\n\n\n\n\nIf you are to keep collecting more observations and say observe a sequence of 100 flips and 30 of them were heads, then the posterior distribution will be more concentrated around the value of \\(\\theta = 0.3\\).\n\nposterior &lt;- likelihood(theta, 100,30) * prior\nposterior &lt;- posterior / sum(posterior) # normalize\nbarplot(posterior, names.arg = theta, xlab = \"theta\", ylab = \"posterior\")\n\n\n\n\nPosterior distribution for n=100\n\n\n\n\nThis demonstrates that for large sample sizes, the frequentist approach and the Bayesian approach agree.",

    "section": "3.3 Beta-Binomial Model",
    "text": "3.3 Beta-Binomial Model\nThe Beta-Binomial Bayesian model is a statistical model that is used when we are interested in learning about a proportion or probability of success, denoted by \\(p\\). This model is particularly useful when dealing with binary data such as conversions or clicks in A/B testing.\nIn the Beta-Binomial model, we assume that the probability of success \\(\\theta\\) in each of \\(n\\) Bernoulli trials is not fixed but randomly drawn from a Beta distribution. The Beta distribution is defined by two shape parameters, \\(\\alpha &gt; 0\\) and \\(\\beta &gt; 0\\).\nThe model combines the prior information about \\(\\theta\\) (represented by the Beta distribution) and the observed data \\(y = (y_1, \\ldots, y_n)\\), where \\(y_i \\sim Binomial(m,\\theta)\\), to update our beliefs about \\(\\theta\\). This is done using Bayes’ Rule, which in this context can be written as: \\[\np(\\theta \\mid y) = \\dfrac{p(y \\mid \\theta)p(\\theta)}{p(y)}\n\\] where \\(p(\\theta)\\) is the prior distribution (Beta), \\(p(y \\mid \\theta)\\) is the likelihood function (Binomial), and \\(p(\\theta\\mid y)\\) is the posterior distribution.\nThe Beta distribution is a family of continuous probability distributions defined on the interval [0,1] in terms of two positive parameters, denoted by alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)) and beta (\\(\\beta\\)), that appear as exponents of the variable and its complement to 1, respectively, and control the shape of the distribution. The Beta distribution is frequently used in Bayesian statistics, empirical Bayes methods, and classical statistics to model random variables with values falling inside a finite interval.\nThe probability density function (PDF) of the Beta distribution is given by: \\[\nBeta(x; \\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{x^{\\alpha - 1}(1 - x)^{\\beta - 1}}{B(\\alpha, \\beta)}\n\\] where \\(x \\in [0, 1]\\), \\(\\alpha &gt; 0\\), \\(\\beta &gt; 0\\), and \\(B(\\alpha, \\beta)\\) is the beta function. It is simply a normalizing constant \\[\nB\\left( \\alpha,\\beta\\right)  =\\int_{0}^{1}\\theta^{\\alpha-1}\\left(  1-\\theta\\right)\n^{\\beta-1}d\\theta .\n\\]\nThe mean and variance of the Beta distribution are given by: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mu &= \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + \\beta} \\\\\n\\sigma^2 &= \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{(\\alpha + \\beta)^2(\\alpha + \\beta + 1)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean and \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the variance.\nThe Beta-Binomial model is one of the simplest Bayesian models and is widely used in various fields including epidemiology, intelligence testing, and marketing. It provides the tools we need to study the proportion of interest, \\(\\theta\\), in a variety of settings.\nThe nice property of the Beta-Binomial model is that the posterior \\(p(p\\mid Y)\\) is yet another Beta distribution. Beta is called a conjugate prior for the Binomial likelihood and is a very useful property.\nWhen \\(m=1\\) (observations follow the Bernoulli distribution), the posterior is given by \\[\np(\\theta\\mid Y) = Beta(Y+\\alpha, 1-Y+\\beta)\n\\] where \\(Y\\) is the number of successful outcomes \\[\nY = \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i,\n\\] where \\(y_i \\sim Bernoulli(\\theta)\\).\nHere the count of successful outcome \\(Y\\) acts as a sufficient statistic for the parameter \\(\\theta\\). This means that the posterior distribution depends on the data only through the sufficient statistic \\(Y\\). This is a very useful property and is a consequence of the conjugacy of the Beta prior and Binomial likelihood.\nIn the case of \\(n&gt;1\\) (observations follow the Binomial distribution), the posterior is given by \\[\np(\\theta\\mid Y) = Beta(Y+\\alpha, n-Y+\\beta)\n\\] where \\(n\\) is the number of observations and \\(Y\\) is the number of successful outcomes as before. \\[\nY = \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i,\n\\] where \\(y_i \\sim Binomial(n,\\theta)\\).\nThe posterior mean and variance are \\[\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\theta\\mid Y\\right]  =\\frac{\\alpha_{n}}{\\alpha_{n}+\\beta_{n}} \\;\\text{ and }\\; \\Var{\n\\theta\\mid Y}  =\\frac{\\alpha_{n}\\beta_{n}}{\\left(  \\alpha_{n}+\\beta_{n}\\right)  ^{2}\\left(   \\alpha_{n}+\\beta_{n}+1\\right)  }\\text{,}\n\\] where \\(\\alpha_{n} = \\alpha + Y\\) and \\(\\beta_{n} = \\beta + n - Y\\).\n\nExample 3.2 (Black Swans) A related problem is the Black Swan inference problem. Suppose that after \\(n\\) trials where \\(n\\) is large you have only seen successes and that you assess the probability of the next trial being a success as \\((T+1)/(T+2)\\) that is, almost certain. This is a model of observing White Swans and having never seen a Black Swan. Taleb (2007) makes it sound as if the rules of probability are not rich enough to be able to handle Black Swan events. There is a related class of problems in finance known as Peso problems where countries decide to devalue their currencies and there is little prior evidence from recent history that such an event is going to happen.\nTo obtain such a probability assessment we use a Binomial/Beta conjugate Bayes updating model. The key point is that it can also explain that there is still a large probability of a Black Swan event to happen sometime in the future. An independence model has difficulty doing this.\nThe Bayes Learning Beta-Binomial model will have no problem. We model with \\(Y_{t}=0\\) or \\(1\\), with probability \\(P\\left( Y_{t}=1\\mid \\theta\\right) =\\theta\\). This is the classic Bernoulli “coin-flipping” model and is a component of more general specifications such as regime switching or outlier-type models.\nLet \\(Y = \\sum_{t=1}^{T}y_{t}\\) be the number of observed successful outcomes. The likelihood for a sequence of Bernoulli observations is then \\[\np\\left(  y\\mid \\theta\\right)  =\\prod_{t=1}^{T}p\\left(  y_{t}\\mid \\theta\\right)\n=\\theta^{Y}\\left(  1-\\theta\\right)^{T-Y}.\n\\] The maximum likelihood estimator is the sample mean, \\(\\widehat{\\theta} = T^{-1}Y\\). This makes little sense when you just observe white swans. It predicts \\(\\hat{\\theta} = 1\\) and gets shocked when it sees a black swan (zero probability event). Bayes, on the other hand, allows for “learning”.\nBayes rule then tells us how to combine the likelihood and prior to obtain a posterior distribution, namely \\(\\theta \\mid Y=y\\). What do we believe about \\(\\theta\\) given a sequence of observations? Our predictor rule is then \\(P(Y_{t+1} =1 \\mid Y=y ) = \\mathbb{E}(\\theta \\mid y)\\) and it is straightforward to show that the posterior distribution is again a Beta distribution with \\[\np\\left( \\theta\\mid y\\right)  \\sim Beta\\left(  \\alpha_{T},\\beta_{T}\\right)  \\; \\mathrm{ and} \\;  \\alpha_{T}=\\alpha+k , \\beta_{T}=\\beta+T-k.\n\\]\nThere is a “conjugate” form of the posterior: it is also a Beta distribution and the hyper-parameters \\(\\alpha_{T}\\) and \\(\\beta_{T}\\) depend on the data only via the sufficient statistics, \\(T\\) and \\(k\\). The posterior mean and variance are \\[\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\theta\\mid y\\right]  =\\frac{\\alpha_{T}}{\\alpha_{T}+\\beta_{T}} \\;\\text{ and }\\; \\Var{\n\\theta\\mid y}  =\\frac{\\alpha_{T}\\beta_{T}}{\\left(  \\alpha_{T}+\\beta_{T}\\right)  ^{2}\\left(   \\alpha_{T}+\\beta_{T}+1\\right)  }\\text{,}\n\\] respectively. This implies that for large samples, \\(\\E{\\theta\\mid y} \\approx \\bar{y} = \\widehat{\\theta}\\), the MLE.\nSuppose that after \\(n\\) trials where \\(n\\) is large you have only seen successes and that you assess the probability of the next trial being a success as \\((T+1)/(T+2)\\) that is, almost certain. This is a model of observing White Swans and having never seen a Black Swan. (Taleb, 2008, The Black Swan: the Impact of the Highly Improbable).\nTo obtain such a probability assessment a natural model is the Binomial/Beta conjugate Bayesian updating model. We can assess the probability that a black Swan event will happen sometime in the future.\nFor the purpose of illustration, start with a uniform prior specification, \\(\\theta \\sim \\mathcal{U}(0,1)\\), then we have the following probability assessment. After \\(T\\) trials, suppose that we have only seen \\(T\\) successes, namely, \\(( y_1 , \\ldots , y_T ) = ( 1 , \\ldots , 1 )\\). Then you assess the probability of the next trial being a success as \\[\np( Y_{T+1} =1 \\mid y_1=1 , \\ldots , y_T=1 ) = \\frac{T+1}{T+2}\n\\] This follows from the mean of the Beta posterior, \\[\n\\theta \\mid y \\sim \\text{Beta}(T+1, 1), ~ P(Y_{T+1} = 1 \\mid y) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\theta \\mid y}\\left[P(Y_{T+1} = 1 \\mid \\theta) \\right] = \\mathbb{E}[\\theta \\mid y].\n\\] For large \\(T\\) this is almost certain.\nNow consider a future set of \\(n\\) trials, where \\(n\\) is also large. The probability of never seeing a Black Swan is then given by \\[\np( y_{T+1} =1 , \\ldots ,  y_{T+n} = 1 \\mid y_1=1 , \\ldots , y_T=1 ) = \\frac{ T+1 }{ T+n+1 }\n\\] For a fixed \\(T\\), and large \\(n\\), we have \\(\\frac{ T+1 }{ T+n+1 } \\rightarrow 0\\). Hence, we will see a Black Swan event with large probability — we just don’t know when! The exchangeable Beta-Binomial model then implies that a Black Swan event will eventually appear. One shouldn’t be that surprised when it actually happens.\n\n\nExample 3.3 (Clinical Trials) Consider a problem of designing clinical trials in which \\(K\\) possible drugs \\(a\\in 1,\\dots,K\\) need to be tested. The outcome of the treatment with drug \\(a\\) is binary \\(y(a) \\in \\{0,1\\}\\). We use Bernoulli distribution with mean \\(f(a)\\) to model the outcome. Thus, the full probabilistic model is described by \\(w = f(1),\\dots,f(K)\\). Say we have observed a sample \\(D = \\{y_1,\\dots,y_n\\}\\). We would like to compute posterior distribution over \\(w\\). We start with a Beta prior \\[\np(w\\mid \\alpha,\\beta) = \\prod_{a=1}^K Beta(w_a\\mid \\alpha,\\beta)    \n\\] Then the posterior distribution is given by \\[\np(w\\mid D) = \\prod_{a=1}^K Beta(w_a\\mid \\alpha + n_{a,1},\\beta + n_{a,0})   \n\\]\nThis setup allows us to perform sequential design of experiments. The simplest version of it is called Thompson sampling. After observing \\(n\\) patients, we draw a single sample \\(\\tilde w\\) from the posterior and then maximize the resulting surrogate \\[\na_{n+1} = \\arg\\max_{a} f_{\\tilde w}(a), ~~~ \\tilde{w} \\sim p(w\\mid D)\n\\]\n\n\nExample 3.4 (Shrinkage and Baseball Batting Averages) The batter-pitcher match-up is a fundamental element of a baseball game. There are detailed baseball records that are examined regularly by fans and professionals. This data provides a good illustration of Bayesian hierarchical methods. There is a great deal of prior information concerning the overall ability of a player. However, we only see a small amount of data about a particular batter-pitcher match-up. Given the relatively small sample size, to determine our optimal estimator we build a hierarchical model taking into account the within pitcher variation.\nLet’s analyze the variability in Jeter’s \\(2006\\) season. Let \\(p_{i}\\) denote Jeter’s ability against pitcher \\(i\\) and assume that \\(p_{i}\\) varies across the population of pitchers according to a particular probability distribution \\((p_{i} \\mid \\alpha,\\beta)\\sim Be(\\alpha,\\beta)\\). To account for extra-binomial variation we use a hierarchical model for the observed number of hits \\(y_{i}\\) of the form \\[\n(y_{i} \\mid p_{i})\\sim Bin(T_{i},p_{i})\\;\\;\\mathrm{with}\\;\\;p_{i}\\sim\nBe(\\alpha,\\beta)\n\\] where \\(T_{i}\\) is the number of at-bats against pitcher \\(i\\). A priori we have a prior mean given by \\(E(p_{i})=\\alpha/(\\alpha+\\beta)=\\bar{p}\\). The extra heterogeneity leads to a prior variance \\(Var(p_{i})=\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})\\phi\\) where \\(\\phi=(\\alpha+\\beta+1)^{-1}\\). Hence \\(\\phi\\) measures how concentrated the beta distribution is around its mean, \\(\\phi=0\\) means highly concentrated and \\(\\phi=1\\) means widely dispersed. \nThis model assumes that each player \\(i\\) has a true ability \\(p_{i}\\) that is drawn from a common distribution. The model is hierarchical in the sense that the parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are estimated from the data. The model is also a shrinkage model in the sense that the estimates of \\(p_{i}\\) are shrunk towards the overall mean \\(\\bar{p}_{i}\\). In reality, we don’t know that each \\(p_i\\) exists. We also don’t know if it follows a Binomial distribution with the Beta prior. We are making a model assumption. However, the model is a good approximation to the data and is a good way to estimate the parameters.\nStern et al. (2007) estimates the parameter \\(\\hat{\\phi} = 0.002\\) for Derek Jeter, showing that his ability varies a bit but not very much across the population of pitchers. The effect of the shrinkage is not surprising. The extremes are shrunk the most with the highest degree of shrinkage occurring for the match-ups that have the smallest sample sizes. The amount of shrinkage is related to the large amount of prior information concerning Jeter’s overall batting average. Overall Jeter’s performance is extremely consistent across pitchers as seen from his estimates. Jeter had a season \\(.308\\) average. We see that his Bayes estimates vary from\\(.311\\) to\\(.327\\) and that he is very consistent. If all players had a similar record then the assumption of a constant batting average would make sense.\n\n\n\nPitcher\nAt-bats\nHits\nObsAvg\nEstAvg\n95% Int\n\n\n\n\nR.

One interesting example is the following. On Aug 29, 2006, Kenny Lofton (career \\(.299\\) average, and current \\(.308\\) average for \\(2006\\) season) was facing the pitcher Milton (current record \\(1\\) for \\(19\\)). He was rested and replaced by a \\(.273\\) hitter. Is putting in a weaker player really a better bet? Was this just an over-reaction to bad luck in the Lofton-Milton match-up? Statistically, from Lofton’s record against Milton we have \\(P\\left( \\leq 1\\;\\mathrm{hit\\;in}\\ 19\\;\\mathrm{attempts} \\mid p=0.3\\right) =0.01\\) an unlikely \\(1\\)-in-\\(100\\) event. However, we have not taken into account the multiplicity of different batter-pitcher match-ups. We know that Lofton’s batting percentage will vary across different pitchers, it’s just a question of how much? A hierarchical analysis of Lofton’s variability gave a \\(\\phi=0.008\\) – four times larger than Jeter’s \\(\\phi=0.002\\). Lofton has batting estimates that vary from \\(.265\\) to \\(.340\\) with the lowest being against Milton. Hence, the optimal estimate for a pitch against Milton is \\(.265&lt;.275\\) and resting Lofton against Milton is justified by this analysis.",

    "text": "3.4 Poisson Model for Count Data\nThe Poisson distribution is obtained as a result of the Binomial when \\(p\\) is small and \\(n\\) is large. In applications, the Poisson models count data. Suppose we want to model the arrival rate of users to one of our stores. Let \\(\\lambda = np\\), which is fixed and take the limit as \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\). There is a relationship between \\(p(x)\\) and \\(p(x+1)\\) given by \\[\n\\dfrac{p(x+1)}{p(x)}= \\dfrac{\\left(\\dfrac{n}{x+1}\\right)p^{x+1}(1-p)^{n-x-1}}{\\left(\\dfrac{n}{x}\\right)p^{x}(1-p)^{n-x}} \\approx \\dfrac{np}{x+1}\n\\] If we approximate \\(p(x+1)\\approx \\lambda p(x)/(x+1)\\) with \\(\\lambda=np\\), then we obtain the Poisson pdf given by \\(p(x) = p(0)\\lambda^x/x!\\). To ensure that \\(\\sum_{x=0}^\\infty p(x) = 1\\), we set \\[\nf(0) = \\dfrac{1}{\\sum_{x=0}^{\\infty}\\lambda^x/x!} = e^{-\\lambda}.\n\\] The above equality follows from the power series property of the exponent function \\[\ne^{\\lambda} = \\sum_{x=0}^{\\infty}\\dfrac{\\lambda^x}{x!}\n\\] The Poisson distribution counts the occurrence of events. Given a rate parameter, denoted by \\(\\lambda\\), we calculate probabilities as follows \\[\np( X = x ) = \\frac{ e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^x }{x!} \\; \\mathrm{ where} \\; x=0,1,2,3, \\ldots\n\\] The mean and variance of the Poisson are given by:\n\n\n\nPoisson Distribution\nParameters\n\n\n\n\nExpected value\n\\(\\mu = \\E{X} = \\lambda\\)\n\n\nVariance\n\\(\\sigma^2 = \\Var{X} = \\lambda\\)\n\n\n\nHere \\(\\lambda\\) denotes the rate of occurrence of an event.\nConsider the problem of modeling soccer scores in the English Premier League (EPL) games. We use data from Betfair, a website, which posts odds on many football games. The goal is to calculate odds for the possible scores in a match. \\[\n0-0, \\; 1-0, \\; 0-1, \\; 1-1, \\; 2-0, \\ldots\n\\]\nAnother question we might ask, is what’s the odds of a team winning? This is given by \\(P\\left ( X&gt; Y \\right )\\). The odds of a draw are given by \\(P \\left ( X = Y \\right )\\). Here \\(X\\) is the number of goals scored by the home team and \\(Y\\) is the number of goals scored by the away team.\nProfessional sports bettors rely on sophisticated statistical models to predict the outcomes. Instead, we present a simple, but useful model for predicting outcomes of EPL games. We follow the methodology given in Spiegelhalter and Ng (2009).\nTo make the discussion more concrete, we will use the data from the English Premier League (EPL) games from the 2014/2015 season. and will model the game between Manchester United and Hull City.\nFirst, load the data and then model the number of goals scored using Poisson distribution for each team.\n\ndf = read.csv(\"../data/epl.csv\")\nknitr::kable(head(df[,c(\"home_team_name\",\"away_team_name\",\"home_score\",\"guest_score\")]))\n\n\n\n\nhome_team_name\naway_team_name\nhome_score\nguest_score\n\n\n\n\nArsenal\nLiverpool\n3\n4\n\n\nBournemouth\nManchester United\n1\n3\n\n\nBurnley\nSwansea\n0\n1\n\n\nChelsea\nWest Ham\n2\n1\n\n\nCrystal Palace\nWest Bromwich Albion\n0\n1\n\n\nEverton\nTottenham\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s look at the empirical distribution across the number of goals scored by Manchester United\n\nteam_name=\"Manchester United\" \nteam_for  = c(df[df$home_team_name==team_name,\"home_score\"],df[df$away_team_name==team_name,\"guest_score\"]) \nn = length(team_for) \nfor_byscore = table(team_for)/n \nbarplot(for_byscore, col=\"coral\", main=\"\")\n\n\n\n\nHistogram of Goals Scored by MU\n\n\n\n\nHence the historical data fits closely to a Poisson distribution, the parameter \\(\\lambda\\) describes the average number of goals scored and we calculate it by calculating the sample mean, the maximum likelihood estimate. A Bayesian method where we assume that \\(\\lambda\\) has a Gamma prior is also available. This lets you incorporate outside information into the predictive model.\n\nlambda_for = mean(team_for) \nbarplot(rbind(dpois(0:4, lambda = lambda_for),for_byscore),beside = T, col=c(\"aquamarine3\",\"coral\"), xlab=\"Goals\", ylab=\"probability\", main=\"\") \nlegend(\"topright\", c(\"Poisson\",\"MU\"), pch=15, col=c(\"aquamarine3\", \"coral\"), bty=\"n\")\n\n\n\n\nHistogram vs Poisson Model Prediction of Goals Scored by MU\n\n\n\n\nNow we will use Poisson model and Monte Carlo simulations to predict possible outcomes of the MU vs Hull games. First we estimate the rate parameter for goals by MU lmb_mu and goals by Hull lmb_h. Each team played a home and away game with every other team, thus 38 total games was played by all teams.

For example, Hull does much better at home games compared to away games. Further, we can include the characteristics of the opponent team to account for interactions between attack strength (number of scored) and defense weakness of the opponent. Now we modify our value of expected goals for each of the teams by calculating \\[\n\\hat \\lambda = \\lambda \\times  \\text{Defense weakness}\n\\]\nLet’s model the MU at Hull game. The average away goals for MU \\(28/19 = 1.4736842\\) and the defense weakness of Hull is \\(36/19 = 1.8421053\\), thus the adjusted expected number of goals to be scored by MU is 2.7922438.

    "text": "3.5 Poisson-Gamma: Learning about an Intensity\nConsider a continuous-time stochastic process, \\(\\left\\{ N_{t}\\right\\} _{t\\geq0}\\), with \\(N_{0}=0\\), counting the number of events that have occurred up to time \\(t\\). The process is constant between event times, and jumps by one at event times: \\(\\Delta N_{t}=N_{t}-N_{t-}=1,\\) where \\(N_{t-}\\) is the limit from the left. The probability of an event over the next short time interval, \\(\\Delta t\\) is \\(\\lambda\\Delta t\\), and \\(N_{t}\\) is called a Poisson process because \\[\nP\\left[  N_{t}=k\\right]  =\\frac{e^{-\\lambda t}\\left(  \\lambda\nt\\right)  ^{k}}{k!}\\text{ for }k=1,\\ldots\n\\] which is the Poisson distribution, thus \\(N_{t}\\sim Poi\\left(\\lambda t\\right)\\). A more general version of the Poisson process is a Cox process, or doubly stochastic point process.\nHere, there is additional conditioning information in the form of state variables, \\(\\left\\{X_{t}\\right\\}_{t&gt;0}\\). The process now has two sources of randomness, one associated with the discontinuous jumps and another in the form of random state variables, \\(\\left\\{X_{t}\\right\\}_{t&gt;0}\\), that drive the intensity of the process. The intensity of the Cox process is \\(\\lambda_{t}=\\int_{0}^{t}\\lambda\\left( X_{s}\\right) ds\\), which is formally defined as \\[\nP\\left[  N_{t}-N_{s}=k \\mid \\left\\{  X_{u}\\right\\}  _{s\\leq u\\leq\nt}\\right]  =\\frac{\\left(  \\int_{s}^{t}\\lambda\\left(  X_{s}\\right)  ds\\right)\n^{k}\\exp\\left(  -\\int_{s}^{t}\\lambda\\left(  X_{s}\\right)  ds\\right)}{k!}, ~ k=0,1,\\ldots\n\\] Cox processes are very useful extensions to Poisson processes and are the basic building blocks of reduced form models of defaultable bonds.\nThe inference problem is to learn about \\(\\lambda\\) from a continuous-record of observation up to time \\(t\\). The likelihood function is given by \\[\np\\left(  N_{t}=k \\mid \\lambda\\right)  =\\frac{\\left(  \\lambda t\\right)  ^{k}%\n\\exp\\left(  -\\lambda t\\right)  }{k!},\n\\] and the MLE is \\(\\widehat{\\lambda}=N_{t}/t\\). The MLE has the unattractive property that prior to the first event \\(\\left\\{ t:N_{t}=0\\right\\}\\), the MLE is 0, despite the fact that the model explicitly assumes that events are possible. This problem often arises in credit risk contexts, where it would seem odd to assume that the probability of default is zero just because a default has not yet occurred.\nA natural prior for this model is the Gamma distribution, which has the following pdf \\[\np\\left(  \\lambda \\mid a,A\\right)  =\\frac{A^{a}}{\\Gamma(a)  }\\lambda^{a-1}\\exp\\left(  -A\\lambda\\right)  \\text{.}\n\\tag{3.2}\\] Like the beta distribution, a Gamma prior distribution allows for a variety of prior shapes and is parameterized by two hyperparameters. Combining the prior and likelihood, the posterior is also Gamma: \\[\np\\left(  \\lambda \\mid N_{t}\\right)  \\propto\\frac{\\left(  \\lambda\\right)\n^{N_{t}+a-1}\\exp\\left(  -\\lambda\\left(  t+A\\right)  \\right)  }{N_{t}!}%\n\\sim\\mathcal{G}\\left(  a_{t},A_{t}\\right)  ,\n\\] where \\(a_{t}=N_{t}+a\\) and \\(A_{t}=t+A\\). The expected intensity, based on information up to time \\(t\\), is \\[\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[  \\lambda \\mid N_{t}\\right]  =\\frac{a_{t}}{A_{t}}=\\frac{N_{t}%\n+a}{t+A}=w_{t}\\frac{N_{t}}{t}+\\left(  1-w_{t}\\right)  \\frac{a}{A},\n\\] where the second line expresses the posterior mean in shrinkage form as a weighted average of the MLE and the prior mean where \\(w_{t}=t/(t+A)\\). In large samples, \\(w_{t}\\rightarrow1\\) and \\(E\\left( \\lambda \\mid N_{t}\\right) \\approx N_{t}/t=\\widehat{\\lambda}\\).\nTo understand the updating mechanics, Figure 3.1 (right column) displays a simulated sample path, posterior means, and (5%,95%) posterior quantiles for various prior configurations. In this case, time is measured in years and the intensity used to simulate the data is \\(\\lambda=1\\), implying on average one event per year. The four prior configurations embody different beliefs. In the first case, in the middle left panel, \\(a=4\\) and \\(A=1\\), captures a high-activity prior, that posits that jumps occur, on average, four times per year, and there is substantial prior uncertainty over the arrival rate as the (5%,95%) prior quantiles are (1.75,6.7). In the second case, captures a prior that is centered over the true value with modest prior uncertainty. The third case captures a low-activity prior, with a prior mean of 0.2 jumps/year. The fourth case captures a dogmatic prior, that posits that jumps occur three times per year, with high confidence in these beliefs.\nThe priors were chosen to highlight different potential paths for Bayesian learning. The first thing to note from the priors is the discontinuity upward at event times, and the exponential decrease during periods of no events, both of which are generic properties of Bayesian learning in this model. If one thinks of the events as rare, this implies rapid revisions in beliefs at event times and a constant drop in estimates of the intensity in periods of no events. For the high-activity prior and the sample path observed, the posterior begins well above \\(\\lambda=1\\), and slowly decreases, getting close to \\(\\lambda=1\\) at the end of the sample. This can be somewhat contrasted with the low-activity prior, which has drastic revisions upward at jump times. In the dogmatic case, there is little updating at event times.

In these cases, prior distributions are often important–even essential–since it is common to build models with events that could, but have not yet occurred. These events are often called ‘Peso’ events. For example, in the case of modeling corporate defaults a researcher wants to allow for a jump to default. This requires positing a prior distribution that places non-zero probability on an event occurring. Classical statistical methods have difficulties dealing with these situations since the MLE of the jump probability is zero, until the first event occurs.",

    "text": "3.6 Normal-Normal Model for Continuous Data\nThe Normal or Gaussian distribution is central to probability and statistical inference. Suppose that we are trying to predict tomorrow’s return on the S&P500. There’s a number of questions that come to mind\n\nWhat is the random variable of interest?\nHow can we describe our uncertainty about tomorrow’s outcome?\nInstead of listing all possible values we’ll work with intervals instead. The probability of an interval is defined by the area under the probability density function.\n\nReturns are continuous (as opposed to discrete) random variables. Hence a normal distribution would be appropriate - but on what scale? We will see that on the log-scale a Normal distribution provides a good approximation.\nThe most widely used model for a continuous random variable is the normal distribution. Standard normal random variable \\(Z\\) has the following properties\nThe standard Normal has mean \\(0\\) and has a variance \\(1\\), and is written as \\[\nZ \\sim N(0,1)\n\\] Then, we have the probability statements of interest \\[\\begin{align*}  \nP(-1 &lt;Z&lt; 1) &=0.68\\\\\nP(-1.96 &lt;Z&lt; 1.96) &=0.95\\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nIn R, we can find probabilities\n\npnorm(1.96)\n\n## [1] 0.98\n\n\nand quantiles\n\nqnorm(0.9750)\n\n## [1] 2\n\n\nThe quantile function qnorm is the inverse of pnorm.\nA random variable that follows normal distribution with general mean and variance \\(X \\sim \\mbox{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), has the following properties \\[\\begin{align*}\n  p(\\mu - 2.58 \\sigma &lt; X &lt; \\mu + 2.58 \\sigma) &=0.99 \\\\\n  p(\\mu - 1.96 \\sigma &lt; X &lt; \\mu + 1.96 \\sigma) &=0.95 \\, .\n\\end{align*}\\] The chance that \\(X\\) will be within \\(2.58 \\sigma\\) of its mean is \\(99\\%\\), and the chance that it will be within \\(2\\sigma\\) of its mean is about \\(95\\%\\).\nThe probability model is written \\(X \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\), where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean, \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the variance. This can be transformed to a standardized normal via \\[\nZ =\\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma} \\sim N(0,1).\n\\] For a normal distribution, we know that \\(X \\in [\\mu-1.96\\sigma,\\mu+1.96\\sigma]\\) with probability 95%. We can make similar claims for any other distribution using the Chebyshev’s empirical rule, which is valid for any population:\n\nAt least 75% probability lies within 2\\(\\sigma\\) of the mean \\(\\mu\\)\nAt least 89% lies within 3\\(\\sigma\\) of the mean \\(\\mu\\)\nAt least \\(100(1-1/m^2)\\)% lies within \\(m\\times \\sigma\\) of the mean \\(\\mu\\).\n\nThis also holds true for the Normal distribution. The percentages are \\(95\\)%, \\(99\\)% and \\(99.99\\)%.\n\nExample 3.5 (Google Stock 2019) Consider observations of daily log-returns of a Google stock for 2019 Daily log-return on day \\(t\\) is calculated by taking a logarithm of the ratio of price at close of day \\(t\\) and at close of day \\(t-1\\) \\[\n  y_t = \\log\\left(\\dfrac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}\\right)\n\\] For example on January 3 of 2017, the open price is 778.81 and close price was 786.140, then the log-return is \\(\\log(786.140/778.81) =  -0.0094\\). It was empirically observed that log-returns follow a Normal distribution. This observation is a basis for Black-Scholes model with is used to evaluate future returns of a stock.\n\np = read.csv(\"../data/GOOG2019.csv\")$Adj.Close; n = length(p) \nr = log(p[2:n]/p[1:(n-1)]) \nhist(r, breaks=30, col=\"lightblue\", main=\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations on the far right correspond to the days when positive news was released and on the far left correspond to bad news. Typically, those are days when the quarterly earnings reports are released.\nTo estimate the expected value \\(\\mu\\) (return) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) (a measure of risk), we simply calculate their sample counterparts \\[\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i, ~\\mathrm{ and }~    s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x} )^2\n\\] The empirical (or sample) values \\(\\bar x\\) and \\(s^2\\) are called sample mean and sample variance. Here simply vie them as our best guess about the mean and variance of the normal distribution model then our probabilistic model for next day’s return is then given by \\[\nR \\sim N(\\bar x, s^2).\n\\]\nSay we are interested in investing into Google and would like to calculated the expected return of our investment as well as risk associated with this investment We assume that behavior of the returns in the future will be the same as in 2019.\n\nn = length(r) \nrbar = sum(r)/n; print(rbar) \n\n## [1] 0.00098\n\ns2 = sum((r-rbar)^2)/(n-1); print(s2) \n\n## [1] 0.00023\n\nx = seq(-0.08,0.08, length.out = 200) \nhist(r, breaks=30, col=\"lightblue\", freq = F, main=\"\", xlab=\"\") \nlines(x,dnorm(x,rbar,sqrt(s2)), col=\"red\", lwd=3)\n\n\n\n\nHistogram (blue) and fitted normal curve (red) of for the Google stock daily return data.\n\n\n\n\nNow, assume, I invest all my portfolio into Google.

The posterior predictive distribution is given by\n\\[\\begin{align*}\np(y_{n+1} \\mid & y_1,\\ldots,y_n) = \\int p(y_{n+1} \\mid \\mu) p(\\mu \\mid y_1,\\ldots,y_n) d\\mu \\\\\n&  = \\int N(y_{n+1} \\mid \\mu, \\sigma^2) N(\\mu \\mid \\mu_n, \\sigma_n^2) d\\mu = N(y_{n+1} \\mid \\mu_n, \\sigma_n^2 + \\sigma^2).\n\\end{align*}\\] This follows from the general properties of the Gaussian distribution",

    "text": "3.8 Normal With Unknown Variance\nConsider, another example, when mean \\(\\mu\\) is fixed and variance is a random variable which follows some distribution \\(\\sigma^2 \\sim p(\\sigma^2)\\). Given an observed sample \\(y\\), we can update the distribution over variance using the Bayes rule \\[\np(\\sigma^2 \\mid  y) = \\dfrac{p(y\\mid \\sigma^2 )p(\\sigma^2)}{p(y)}.\n\\] Now, the total probability in the denominator can be calculated as \\[\np(y) = \\int p(y\\mid \\sigma^2 )p(\\sigma^2) d\\sigma^2.\n\\]\nA conjugate prior that leads to analytically calculable integral for variance under the normal likelihood is the inverse Gamma. Thus, if \\[\n\\sigma^2 \\mid  \\alpha,\\beta \\sim IG(\\alpha,\\beta) = \\dfrac{\\beta^{\\alpha}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)}\\sigma^{2(-\\alpha-1)}\\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{\\beta}{\\sigma^2}\\right)\n\\] and \\[\ny \\mid \\mu,\\sigma^2 \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\n\\] Then the posterior distribution is another inverse Gamma \\(IG(\\alpha_{\\mathrm{posterior}},\\beta_{\\mathrm{posterior}})\\), with \\[\n\\alpha_{\\mathrm{posterior}} = \\alpha + 1/2, ~~\\beta_{\\mathrm{posterior}} = \\beta + \\dfrac{y-\\mu}{2}.\n\\]\nNow, the predictive distribution over \\(y\\) can be calculated by \\[\np(y_{new}\\mid y) = \\int p(y_{new},\\sigma^2\\mid y)p(\\sigma^2\\mid y)d\\sigma^2.\n\\] Which happens to be a \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(2\\alpha_{\\mathrm{posterior}}\\) degrees of freedom, mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\alpha_{\\mathrm{posterior}}/\\beta_{\\mathrm{posterior}}\\).\n\nThe Normal-Gamma Model\nNow, consider the case when both mean and variance are unknow. To simplify the formulas, we will use precision \\(\\rho = 1/\\sigma^2\\) instead of variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). The normal-Gamma distribution is a conjugate prior for the normal distribution, when we do not know the precision and the mean. Given the observed data \\(Y  = \\{y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\}\\), we assume normal likelihood \\[\ny_i \\mid \\theta, \\rho \\sim N(\\theta, 1/\\rho)\n\\]\nThe normal-gamma prior distribution is defined as \\[\n\\theta\\mid \\mu,\\rho,\\nu \\sim N(\\mu, 1/(\\rho \\nu)), \\quad \\rho \\mid \\alpha, \\beta \\sim \\text{Gamma}(\\alpha, \\beta).\n\\] Thus, \\(1/\\rho\\) has inverse-Gamma distribution with parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). Conditional on \\(\\rho\\), the mean \\(\\theta\\) has normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and precision \\(\\nu\\rho\\). Notice that in this model the mean \\(\\theta\\) and precision \\(\\rho\\) are not independent. When the precision of observations \\(\\rho\\) is low, we are also less certain about the mean. However, when \\(\\nu=0\\), we have an improper uniform distribution over \\(\\theta\\), that is independent of \\(\\rho\\). There is no conjugate distribution for \\(\\theta,\\rho\\) in which \\(\\theta\\) is independent of \\(\\rho\\). Given the normal likelihood \\[\np(y\\mid \\theta, \\rho) = \\left(\\dfrac{\\rho}{2\\pi}\\right)^{1/2}\\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{\\rho}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\theta)^2\\right)\n\\] and the normal-gamma prior \\[\np(\\theta, \\rho \\mid \\mu,\\nu,\\alpha,\\beta) = \\dfrac{\\beta^\\alpha}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)}\\nu\\rho^{\\alpha-1}\\exp(-\\beta\\rho)\\left(\\dfrac{\\nu\\rho}{2\\pi}\\right)^{1/2}\\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{\\nu\\rho}{2}(\\theta-\\mu)^2\\right)\n\\] the posterior distribution is given by \\[\np(\\theta, \\rho\\mid y) \\propto p(y\\mid \\theta, \\rho)p(\\theta, \\rho).\n\\] The posterior distribution is a normal-Gamma distribution with parameters \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mu_n &= \\dfrac{\\nu\\mu + n\\bar{y}}{\\nu+n},\\\\\n\\nu_n &= \\nu+n,\\\\\n\\alpha_n &= \\alpha + \\dfrac{n}{2},\\\\\n\\beta_n &= \\beta + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\bar{y})^2 + \\dfrac{n\\nu}{2(\\nu+n)}(\\bar{y}-\\mu)^2.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(\\bar{y} = n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\\) is the sample mean and \\(n\\) is the sample size. The posterior distribution is a normal-Gamma distribution with parameters \\(\\mu_n, \\nu_n, \\alpha_n, \\beta_n\\).\n\n\nCredible Intervals for Normal-Gamma Model Posterior Parameters\nThe precission posterior follows a Gamma distribution with parameters \\(\\alpha_n, \\beta_n\\), thus we can use quantiles of the Gamma distribution to calculate credible intervals. A symmetric \\(100(1-c)%\\) credible interval \\([g_{c/2},g_{1-c/2}]\\) is given by \\(c/2\\) and \\(1-c/2\\) quantiles of the gamma distrinution.

The stock price of Microsoft has been on a steady rise since then. Suppose that you are a portfolio manager and you are interested in analyzing the returns of Microsoft stock compared to the market.\nSuppose you are managing a portfolio with two positions stock of Microsoft (MSFT) and an index fund that follows S&P500 index and tracks overall market performance. We are interested in estimating the mean returns of the positions in our portfolio. You believe that the returns are normally distributed and are related to each other. You have prior beliefs about these returns, which are also normally distributed. We will use what is called the empirical prior for the mean returns. This is a prior that is based on historical data. The empirical prior is a good choice when you have a lot of historical data and you believe that the future mean returns will be similar to the historical mean returns. We assume the prior for the mean returns is a bivariate normal distribution, let \\(\\mu_0 = (\\mu_{M}, \\mu_{S})\\) represent the prior mean returns for the stocks. The covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma_0\\) captures your beliefs about the variability and the relationship between these stocks’ returns in the prior. We will use the sample mean and covariance matrix of the historical returns as the prior mean and covariance matrix. The prior covariance matrix is given by \\[\n\\Sigma_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma_{M}^2 & \\sigma_{MS} \\\\ \\sigma_{MS} & \\sigma_{S}^2 \\end{bmatrix},\n\\] where \\(\\sigma_{M}^2\\) and \\(\\sigma_{S}^2\\) are the sample variances of the historical returns of MSFT and SPY, respectively, and \\(\\sigma_{MS}\\) is the sample covariance of the historical returns of MSFT and SPY. The prior mean is given by \\[\n\\mu_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mu_{M} \\\\ \\mu_{S} \\end{bmatrix},\n\\] where \\(\\mu_{M}\\) and \\(\\mu_{S}\\) are the sample means of the historical returns of MSFT and SPY, respectively. The likelihood of observing the data, given the mean returns, is also a bivariate normal distribution. The mean of this distribution is the true (but unknown) mean returns \\(\\mu = [\\mu_A, \\mu_B]\\). The covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\) of the likelihood represents the uncertainty in your data. We will use the sample mean and covariance matrix of the observed returns as the likelihood mean and covariance matrix. The likelihood covariance matrix is given by \\[\n\\Sigma = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma_{M}^2 & \\sigma_{MS} \\\\ \\sigma_{MS} & \\sigma_{S}^2 \\end{bmatrix},\n\\] where \\(\\sigma_{M}^2\\) and \\(\\sigma_{S}^2\\) are the sample variances of the observed returns of MSFT and SPY, respectively, and \\(\\sigma_{MS}\\) is the sample covariance of the observed returns of MSFT and SPY. The likelihood mean is given by \\[\n\\mu = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mu_{M} \\\\ \\mu_{S} \\end{bmatrix},\n\\] where \\(\\mu_{M}\\) and \\(\\mu_{S}\\) are the sample means of the observed returns of MSFT and SPY, respectively. In a Bayesian framework, you update your beliefs (prior) about the mean returns using the observed data (likelihood). The posterior distribution, which combines your prior beliefs and the new information from the data, is also a bivariate normal distribution. The mean \\(\\mu_{\\text{post}}\\) and covariance \\(\\Sigma_{\\text{post}}\\) of the posterior are calculated using Bayesian updating formulas, which involve \\(\\mu_0\\), \\(\\Sigma_0\\), \\(\\mu\\), and \\(\\Sigma\\).\nWe use observed returns prior to Nadella’s becoming CEO as our prior and analyze the returns post 2014. Thus, our observed data includes July 2015 - Dec 2023 period. We assume the likelihood of observing this data, given the mean returns, is also a bivariate normal distribution. The mean of this distribution is the true (but unknown) mean returns. The covariance matrix \\(Sigma\\) of the likelihood represents the uncertainty in your data and is calculated from the overall observed returns data 2001-2023.\n\ngetSymbols(c(\"MSFT\", \"SPY\"), from = \"2001-01-01\", to = \"2023-12-31\")\n\n## [1] \"MSFT\" \"SPY\"\n\ns = 3666 # 2015-07-30\nprior = 1:s\nobs = s:nrow(MSFT) # post covid\n# obs = 5476:nrow(MSFT) # 2022-10-06 bull run if 22-23\na = as.numeric(dailyReturn(MSFT))\nc = as.numeric(dailyReturn(SPY))\n# Prior\nmu0 = c(mean(a[prior]), mean(c[prior]))\nSigma0 = cov(data.frame(a=a[prior],c=c[prior]))\n# Data\nmu = c(mean(a[obs]), mean(c[obs]))\nSigma = cov(data.frame(a=a,c=c))\n# Posterior\nSigmaPost = solve(solve(Sigma0) + solve(Sigma))\nmuPost = SigmaPost %*% (solve(Sigma0) %*% mu0 + solve(Sigma) %*% mu)\n# Plot\nplot(a[obs], c[obs], xlab=\"MSFT\", ylab=\"SPY\", xlim=c(-0.005,0.005), \n    ylim=c(-0.005,0.005), pch=16, cex=0.5)\nabline(v=0, h=0, col=\"grey\")\nabline(v=mu0[1], h=mu0[2], col=\"blue\",lwd=3) #prior\nabline(v=mu[1], h=mu[2], col=\"red\",lwd=3) #data\nabline(v=muPost[1], h=muPost[2], col=\"green\",lwd=3) #posterior\nlegend(\"bottomright\", c(\"Prior\", \"Likelihood\", \"Posterior\"), pch=15, \n    col=c(\"blue\", \"red\", \"green\"), bty=\"n\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Bayesian Portfolio Updating\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see the posterior mean for SPY is close to the prior mean, while the posterior mean for MSFT is further away.

    "section": "3.11 Exponential-Gamma Model",
    "text": "3.11 Exponential-Gamma Model\nExponential distribution is a continuous distribution that is often used to model waiting times between events. For example, the time between two consecutive arrivals of a Poisson process is exponentially distributed. If the number of events in 1 unit of time has the Poisson distribution with rate parameter \\(\\lambda\\), then the time between events has the exponential distribution with mean \\(1/\\lambda\\). The probability density function (PDF) of an exponential distribution is defined as: \\[\nf(x;\\lambda) =  \\lambda e^{-\\lambda x}, ~ x \\geq 0\n\\] The exponential distribution is defined for \\(x \\geq 0\\), and \\(\\lambda\\) is the rate parameter, which is the inverse of the mean (or expected value) of the distribution. It must be greater than 0. The exponential distribution is a special case of the Gamma distribution with shape 1 and scale \\(1/\\lambda\\).\nThe mean and variance are give in terms of the rate parameter \\(\\lambda\\) as\n\n\n\nExponential Distribution\nParameters\n\n\n\n\nExpected value\n\\(\\mu = \\E{X} = 1/\\lambda\\)\n\n\nVariance\n\\(\\sigma^2 = \\Var{X} = 1/\\lambda^2\\)\n\n\n\nHere are some examples of when exponential model provides a good fit\n\nLifespan of Electronic Components: The exponential distribution can model the time until a component fails in systems where the failure rate is constant over time.\nTime Between Arrivals: In a process where events (like customers arriving at a store or calls arriving at a call center) occur continuously and independently, the time between these events can often be modeled with an exponential distribution.\nRadioactive Decay: The time until a radioactive atom decays is often modeled with an exponential distribution.\n\nIn these examples, the key assumption is that events happen independently and at a constant average rate, which makes the exponential distribution a suitable model.\nThe Exponential-Gamma model, often used in Bayesian statistics, is a model where the exponential distribution’s parameter is itself modeled as following a Gamma distribution. This approach is particularly useful in situations where there is uncertainty or variability in the rate parameter of the exponential distribution.\nThe Exponential-Gamma model assumes that the data follows an exponential distribution (likelihood). As mentioned earlier, the exponential distribution is suitable for modeling the time between events in processes where these events occur independently and at a constant rate. At the next level, the rate parameter \\(\\lambda\\) of the exponential distribution is assumed to follow a Gamma distribution. The Gamma distribution is a flexible two-parameter family of distributions and can model a wide range of shapes. \\[\\begin{align*}\n    \\lambda &\\sim \\text{Gamma}(\\alpha, \\beta) \\\\\n    y_i &\\sim \\text{Exponential}(\\lambda)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe probability density function of the Gamma distribution is given by Equation 3.2 and has two parameters, shape \\(\\alpha\\) and rate \\(\\beta\\). The posterior distribution of the rate parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is given by: \\[\np(\\lambda\\mid x_1, \\ldots, x_n) \\propto \\lambda^{\\alpha - 1} e^{-\\beta\\lambda} \\prod_{i=1}^n \\lambda e^{-\\lambda x_i} = \\lambda^{\\alpha + n - 1} e^{-(\\beta + \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i)\\lambda}\n\\] which is a Gamma distribution with shape parameter \\(\\alpha + n\\) and rate parameter \\(\\beta + \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\). The posterior mean and variance are given by: \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[\\lambda|x_1, \\ldots, x_n] = \\frac{\\alpha + n}{\\beta + \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}, \\quad \\mathrm{Var}[\\lambda|x_1, \\ldots, x_n] = \\frac{\\alpha + n}{(\\beta + \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i)^2}.\n\\] Notice, that \\(\\sum x_i\\) is the sufficient statistic for inference about parameter \\(\\lambda\\)!\nThe Exponential-Gamma model finds practical application in a variety of fields where the underlying rate of events is not constant but subject to uncertainty or heterogeneity.\nIn reliability engineering, for example, the failure rate of components or systems may fluctuate due to manufacturing differences, operational environments, or aging effects. The Exponential-Gamma model allows engineers to estimate the time until failure while explicitly incorporating this uncertainty in the failure rate, leading to more robust predictions and maintenance schedules.\nIn medical research, the model is often used to analyze survival times of patients. Here, the rate at which mortality or disease progression occurs can vary significantly across individuals, influenced by factors such as age, genetic predispositions, or environmental exposures. By modeling the rate parameter as a random variable, the Exponential-Gamma approach captures this variability, providing a more realistic assessment of survival probabilities within a heterogeneous population.\nIn ecology, when studying the time between rare environmental events—such as extreme weather occurrences—the frequency of these events may change due to shifting climate conditions or other ecological factors. The Exponential-Gamma model accommodates this variability, enabling ecologists to better quantify the uncertainty in the timing of such rare events.\nAcross these domains, the Exponential-Gamma model offers a more flexible and nuanced alternative to the simple exponential model, as it explicitly accounts for the variability in the rate parameter rather than assuming it is fixed and known.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "4.1 Expected Utility\nLife is about making decisions under uncertainty. We always prefer informed decisions. Statistical decision theory studies the process of finding a reasonable course of action when faced with statistical uncertainty–uncertainty that can in part be quantified from observed data. In most cases, the problem can be separated into two problems: a learning problem or parameter estimation problem and then a decision problem that uses the output of the learning problem. In finance, a classic example of this is finding optimal portfolios with a mean-variance utility/criterion function assuming the underlying means, variances and covariances are unknown based on a historical sample of data. In statistics, the classic problem is using decision theory to evaluate the relative merits of different parameter estimators and hypothesis tests.\nLet \\(P,Q\\) be two possible risky gambles or probability bets. An agent’s preferences can then be specified as an ordering on probability bets where we write \\(P\\) is preferred to \\(Q\\) as \\(P \\succeq Q\\) and indifference as \\(P \\sim Q\\). A compound or mixture bet is defined by the probability assignment \\(p P + (1 - p ) Q\\) for a prospect weight \\(0 \\leq p \\leq 1\\).\nRamsey-de Finetti-Savage show that if an agent’s preferences satisfy a number of plausible axioms – completeness, transitivity, continuity and independence – then they can be represented by the expectation of a utility function. The theory is a normative one and not necessarily descriptive. It suggests how a rational agent should formulate beliefs and preferences and not how they actually behave.\nThis representation of preferences in terms of expected utility \\(U(P)\\) of a risky gamble is then equivalent to \\[\nP \\succeq Q \\; \\; \\iff \\; \\; U (P) \\geq U (Q )\n\\] Therefore, the higher the value taken by the utility function the more the gamble is preferred. Specifically, the axioms lead to existence of expected utility and uniqueness of probability.\nThe two key facts then are uniqueness of probability and existence of expected utility. Formally,\nThis implies that \\(U\\) is additive and it is also unique up to affine transformation.\nProof: If \\(w\\) is not unique then \\(\\exists w_1\\) such that \\(w_1 P + (1 - w_1 ) Q \\sim R\\). Without loss of generality assume that \\(w_1 &lt; w\\) and so \\(0 &lt; w - w_1 &lt; 1 - w_1\\). However, we can write the bet \\(Q\\) as \\[\nQ = \\left ( \\frac{w-w_1}{1-w_1} \\right ) Q + \\left ( \\frac{1-w}{1-w_1} \\right ) Q\n\\] By transitivity, as \\(P \\succeq Q\\) we have \\[\n\\left ( \\frac{w-w_1}{1-w_1} \\right ) P + \\left ( \\frac{1-w}{1-w_1} \\right ) Q \\succeq Q\n\\] However, \\[\nw P + ( 1 - w) Q = w_1 P + (1 - w_1 ) \\left (  \\left ( \\frac{w-w_1}{1-w_1} \\right ) P + \\left ( \\frac{1-w}{1-w_1} \\right ) Q\n\\right )\n\\] implying by transitivity that \\[\nw P + (1 - w ) Q \\succeq w_1 P + (1 - w_1 ) Q\n\\] which is a contradiction.\nThis can be used together with the axioms to then prove the existence and uniqueness of a utility function.\nOther interesting extensions: how do people come to a consensus (DeGroot, 1974, Morris, 1994, 1996). Ramsey (1926) observation that if someone is willing to offer you a bet then that’s conditioning information for you. All probabilities are conditional probabilities.\nIf the bet outcome \\(P\\) is a monetary value, then the utility functions \\(P, P^2, \\sqrt{P}, \\ln P\\) are all monotonically increasing (the more the better). However, the utility function \\(P^2\\) is convex and the utility function \\(\\ln P\\) is concave. The concavity of the utility function implies that the agent is risk averse and the convexity implies that the agent is risk seeking.\nNow, consider a more general situation, when you have two gambles 1: get \\(P_1\\) for sure, 2: get \\(P_2 = P_1+k\\) and \\(P_3 = P_1-k\\) with probability 1/2. Then we will compare the utility of those gambles \\[\n\\dfrac{1}{2}U(P_2) + \\dfrac{1}{2}U(P_3) \\text{ and } U(P_1).\n\\] If the utility function is linear then we should be indifferent between the two gambles. However, if the utility function is concave then we should prefer the sure thing. This is known as the certainty effect. \\[\n\\dfrac{1}{2}U(P_2) + \\dfrac{1}{2}U(P_3) &lt; U(P_1).\n\\]\nThe usual situation can be described as follows. Let \\(\\Omega\\) be a finite set of possible outcomes with \\(\\Omega = \\{ \\omega_1 , \\ldots , \\omega_n \\}\\). Let \\(P_i\\) be the consequence that assigns one to outcome \\(\\omega_i\\) and zero otherwise and let \\(P = ( p_1 , \\ldots , p_n )\\) assign probability \\(p_i\\) to outcome \\(\\omega_i\\). Then we can write the expected utility, \\(U(P)\\), of the gamble \\(P\\) as \\[\nU(P) = \\sum_{i=1}^n p_i U( P_i ).\n\\] That is, the utility of \\(P\\) is the expected value of a random variable \\(W\\) (wealth) that takes the value \\(U(P_i)\\) if the outcome is \\(\\omega_i\\). Therefore, we can write \\(U(P) = \\mathbb{E}_P \\left ( U( W ) \\right)\\).\nThis leads us to the notion of risk aversion and a categorization of agents according to their risk tolerance: the agent is said to be\nHere we assume that these hold for all probabilities and random variables. Risk aversion is equivalent to the agent having concave utility and risk seeking convex.\nPower utility and log-utilities allow us to model constant relative risk aversion (CRRA). The main advantage is that the optimal rule is unaffected by wealth effects. The CRRA utility of wealth takes the form \\[\nU_\\gamma (W) = \\frac{ W^{1-\\gamma} -1 }{1-\\gamma}\n\\]\nThe special case \\(U(W) = \\log (W )\\) for \\(\\gamma = 1\\). This leads to a myopic Kelly criterion rule.",

See Savage (1954), Ramsey (1927) and de Finetti (1931)\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.1 (Saint Petersburg Paradox) The Saint Petersburg paradox is a concept in probability and decision theory that was first introduced by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738. It revolves around the idea of how individuals value risky propositions and how those valuations may not align with classical expected utility theory.\nThe paradox is named after the city of Saint Petersburg, where the problem was formulated. Here’s a simplified version of the paradox:\nImagine a gambling game where a fair coin is flipped repeatedly until it lands on heads. The payoff for the game is \\(2^N\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of tosses needed for the coin to land on heads. The expected value of this game, calculated by multiplying each possible payoff by its probability and summing the results, is infinite:\n\\[\nE(X) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 4 + \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot 8 + \\ldots = \\infty\n\\]\nThis means that, in theory, a rational person should be willing to pay any finite amount to play this game, as the expected value is infinite. However, in reality, most people would be unwilling to pay a large amount to play such a game.\nThe paradox arises because traditional expected utility theory assumes that individuals make decisions based on maximizing their expected gain. Bernoulli argued that people do not maximize expected monetary value but rather expected utility, where utility is a subjective measure of satisfaction or happiness. He proposed that individuals exhibit diminishing marginal utility for wealth, meaning that the additional satisfaction gained from an extra unit of wealth decreases as total wealth increases.\nIn the case of the Saint Petersburg paradox, although the expected monetary value is infinite, the utility gained from each additional dollar diminishes rapidly, leading to a reluctance to pay large amounts to play the game.\nIn modern decision theory and economics, concepts like diminishing marginal utility and expected utility are fundamental in understanding how individuals make choices under uncertainty and risk. The Saint Petersburg paradox highlights the limitations of relying solely on expected monetary value in explaining human behavior in such situations.\nOne common approach is to consider aspects of potential players, such as their possible risk aversion, available funds, etc., through a utility function \\(U(x)\\). Applying a utility function in this situation means changing our focus to the quantity \\[\nE[U(X)] = \\sum^\\infty_{k=1} 2^{-k} U(2^k).   \n\\]\nSome examples of utility functions are,\n\n\\(U(x) = V_0 (1-x^{-\\alpha})\\), \\(\\alpha &gt; 0\\), which gives an expected utility of \\(V_0 \\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^{\\alpha+1}-1}\\right)\\)\nLog utility, \\(U(x) = \\log(x)\\), with expected value \\(2 \\log(2)\\).\n\nNotice that after obtaining an expected utility value, you’ll have to find the corresponding reward/dollar amount.\nFor the log utility case, we need to find the certain dollar amount \\(x^*\\) that provides the same utility as playing the game. Setting \\(U(x^*) = 2\\log(2)\\), we solve: \\[\n\\log(x^*) = 2\\log(2) = \\log(2^2) = \\log(4)\n\\] which gives \\(x^* = 4\\). Therefore, under log utility, a rational player would be willing to pay at most $4 to play the Saint Petersburg game, despite its infinite expected monetary value. This is a dramatic reduction from infinity and demonstrates how risk aversion (captured by the concave log utility function) resolves the paradox.\nSimilarly, for the power utility \\(U(x) = V_0 (1-x^{-\\alpha})\\) with \\(\\alpha &gt; 0\\), we have an expected utility of \\(V_0 \\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^{\\alpha+1}-1}\\right)\\). To find the certainty equivalent \\(x^*\\), we solve: \\[\nV_0 (1-(x^*)^{-\\alpha}) = V_0 \\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^{\\alpha+1}-1}\\right)\n\\] which simplifies to \\((x^*)^{-\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{2^{\\alpha+1}-1}\\), giving: \\[\nx^* = \\left(2^{\\alpha+1}-1\\right)^{1/\\alpha}\n\\] For example, with \\(\\alpha = 1\\), we get \\(x^* = (2^2-1)^1 = 3\\) dollars. As risk aversion increases (larger \\(\\alpha\\)), the certainty equivalent further decreases.\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Averse if \\(\\mathbb{E}_P \\left ( U(W) \\right ) \\leq U \\left (  \\mathbb{E}_P  (W)  \\right )\\)\nRisk Neutral if \\(\\mathbb{E}_P \\left ( U(W) \\right ) =    U \\left (  \\mathbb{E}_P  (W)  \\right )\\)\nRisk Seeking if \\(\\mathbb{E}_P \\left ( U(W) \\right ) \\geq U \\left (  \\mathbb{E}_P  (W)  \\right )\\)\n\n\n\nExample 4.2 (Risk Aversion) Consider two concave utility functions log-utility (Kelly) \\(U(W)=\\log(W)\\) and fractional Kelly \\(U(W)=\\dfrac{W^{1-\\gamma} - 1}{1-\\gamma}\\), when \\(\\gamma = 1\\), we get the log-utility. Both correspond to different risk aversion levels. The log-utility is a special case of the power utility function, which is defined as \\(U(W) = \\frac{W^{1-\\gamma} - 1}{1-\\gamma}\\) for \\(\\gamma &gt; 0\\). The fractional Kelly criterion is a specific case of the power utility function where \\(\\gamma = 2\\).\n\nw &lt;- seq(0.2, 2, length.out = 500)\ngamma=2\n # Plot this data frame\ndf &lt;- data.frame(w = w, \n                 logu = log(w), \n                 kelly = (w^(1-gamma) - 1) / (1-gamma))\n# 3.

Ed Thorp, in his book Beat the Dealer, pioneered its use in blackjack and later applied it to investing in financial markets. Since then, many market participants, such as Jim Simons, have stressed the importance of this money management approach. The criterion’s application extends to other domains: Phil Laak described its use for bet sizing in a game-theoretic approach to poker, and Bill Benter applied it to horse racing. Stewart Ethier provided a mathematical framework for multiple outcomes and analyzed a “play the winner” rule in roulette. Claude Shannon also developed a system to detect and exploit unintentionally biased roulette wheels, an endeavor chronicled in the book The Eudaemonic Pie.\nSuppose you have $1000 to invest. With probability \\(0.55\\) you will win whatever you wager and with probability \\(0.45\\) you lose whatever you wager. What’s the proportion of capital that leads to the fastest compounded growth rate?\nQuoting Kelly (1956), the exponential rate of growth, \\(G\\), of a gambler’s capital is \\[\nG = \\lim_{N\\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{N} \\log_2 \\frac{W_N}{W_0}\n\\] for initial capital \\(W_0\\) and capital after \\(N\\) bets \\(W_N\\).\nUnder the assumption that a gambler bets a fraction of his capital, \\(\\omega\\), each time, we use \\[\nW_N = (1+\\omega)^W (1-\\omega)^L W_0\n\\] where \\(W\\) and \\(L\\) are the number of wins and losses in \\(N\\) bets. We get \\[\nG = p \\log_2(1+\\omega)+ q \\log_2(1-\\omega)\n\\] in which the limit(s) of \\(\\frac{W}{N}\\) and \\(\\frac{L}{N}\\) are the probabilities \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), respectively.\nThis also comes about by considering the sequence of i.i.d. bets with \\[\np ( X_t = 1 ) = p \\; \\; \\text{ and} \\; \\; p ( X_t = -1 ) = q=1-p\n\\] We want to find an optimal allocation \\(\\omega^*\\) that maximizes the expected long-run growth rate: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\max_\\omega \\mathbb{E} \\left ( \\ln ( 1 + \\omega W_T ) \\right )\n& = p \\ln ( 1 + \\omega ) + (1 -p) \\ln (1 - \\omega ) \\\\\n& \\leq p \\ln p + q \\ln q + \\ln 2 \\; \\text{ and} \\; \\omega^\\star = p - q\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe solution is \\(w^* = 0.55 - 0.45 = 0.1\\).\nBoth approaches give the same optimization problem, which, when solved, give the optimal fraction rate \\(\\omega^* = p-q\\), thus, with \\(p=0.55\\), the optimal allocation is 10% of capital.\nWe can generalize the rule to the case of asymmetric payouts \\((a,b)\\). Then the expected utility function is \\[\np \\ln ( 1 + b \\omega ) + (1 -p) \\ln (1 - a \\omega )\n\\] The optimal solution is \\[\n\\omega^\\star = \\frac{bp - a q}{ab}\n\\]\nIf \\(a=b=1\\) this reduces to the pure Kelly criterion.\nA common case occurs when \\(a=1\\) and market odds \\(b=O\\). The rule becomes \\[\n\\omega^* = \\frac{p \\cdot O  -q }{O}.\n\\]\nLet’s consider another scenario. You have two possible market opportunities: one where it offers you \\(4/1\\) when you have personal odds of \\(3/1\\) and a second one when it offers you \\(12/1\\) while you think the odds are \\(9/1\\).\nIn expected return these two scenarios are identical both offering a 33% gain. In terms of maximizing long-run growth, however, they are not identical.\nTable 4.1 shows the Kelly criterion advises an allocation that is twice as much capital to the lower odds proposition: \\(1/16\\) weight versus \\(1/40\\).\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Kelly rule\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket\nYou\n\\(\\Delta\\)\n\\(\\omega^\\star\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(4/1\\)\n\\(3/1\\)\n\\(1/4\\)\n\\(1/16\\)\n\n\n\\(12/1\\)\n\\(9/1\\)\n\\(1/10\\)\n\\(1/40\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe optimal allocation \\(\\omega^\\star = ( p O - q ) / O\\) is \\[\n\\frac{ (1/4) \\times 4 - (3/4) }{4} = \\frac{1}{16} \\; \\text{ and} \\;\n\\frac{ (1/10) \\times 12 - (9/10) }{12} = \\frac{1}{40}.\n\\]\nNote, that although the expected return is the same, the risk is different. The first gamble has a higher variance than the second gamble.",

    "text": "4.2 Unintuitive Nature of Decision Making\n\nExample 4.4 (Ellsberg Paradox: Ambiguity Aversion) The Ellsberg paradox is a thought experiment that was first proposed by Daniel Ellsberg in 1961. It is a classic example of a situation where individuals exhibit ambiguity aversion, meaning that they prefer known risks over unknown risks. The paradox highlights the importance of considering ambiguity when making decisions under uncertainty.\nThere are two urns each containing 100 balls. It is known that urn A contains 50 red and 50 black, but urn B contains an unknown mix of red and black balls. The following bets are offered to a participant:\n\nBet 1A: get $1 if red is drawn from urn A, $0 otherwise\nBet 2A: get $1 if black is drawn from urn A, $0 otherwise\nBet 1B: get $1 if red is drawn from urn B, $0 otherwise\nBet 2B: get $1 if black is drawn from urn B, $0 otherwise\n\n\n\nExample 4.5 (Allais Paradox: Independence Axiom) The Allais paradox is a choice problem designed by Maurice Allais to show an inconsistency of actual observed choices with the predictions of expected utility theory. The paradox is that the choices made in the second problem seem irrational, although they can be explained by the fact that the independence axiom of expected utility theory is violated.\nWe run two experiments. In each experiment a participant has to make a choice between two gambles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGamble \\({\\cal G}_1\\)\n\nGamble \\({\\cal G}_2\\)\n\n\n\nWin\nChance\nWin\nChance\n\n\n$25m\n0\n$25m\n0.1\n\n\n$5m\n1\n$5m\n0.89\n\n\n$0m\n0\n$0m\n0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGamble \\({\\cal G}_3\\)\n\nGamble \\({\\cal G}_4\\)\n\n\n\nWin\nChance\nWin\nChance\n\n\n$25\n0\n$25m\n0.1\n\n\n$5\n0.11\n$5m\n0\n\n\n$0m\n0.89\n$0m\n0.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference in expected gains is identical in two experiments\n\nE1 = 5*1 \nE2 = 25*0.1 + 5*0.89 + 0*0.01\nE3 = 5*0.11 + 0*0.89\nE4 = 25*0.1 + 0*0.9\nprint(c(E1-E2,E3-E4))\n\n -2 -2\n\n\nHowever, typically a person prefers \\({\\cal G}_1\\) to \\({\\cal G}_2\\) and \\({\\cal G}_4\\) to \\({\\cal G}_3\\), we can conclude that the expected utilities of the preferred are greater than the expected utilities of the second choices. The fact is that if \\({\\cal G}_1 \\geq {\\cal G}_2\\) then \\({\\cal G}_3 \\geq {\\cal G}_4\\) and vice-versa.\nAssuming the subjective probabilities \\(P = ( p_1 , p_2 , p_3)\\). The expected utility \\(E ( U | P )\\) is \\(u ( 0 ) = 0\\) and for the high prize set \\(u ( \\$ 25 \\; \\text{million} ) = 1\\), which leaves one free parameter \\(u = u(\\$ 5 \\; \\text{million})\\).\nHence to compare gambles with probabilities \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) we look at the difference \\[\nE ( u | P ) - E ( u | Q ) = ( p_2 - q_2 ) u + ( p_3 - q_3 )\n\\]\nFor comparing \\({\\cal G}_1\\) and \\({\\cal G}_2\\) we get \\[\\begin{align*}\nE ( u | {\\cal G}_1 ) - E ( u | {\\cal G}_2 ) &= 0.11 u - 0.1 \\\\\nE ( u | {\\cal G}_3 ) - E ( u | {\\cal G}_4 ) &= 0.11 u - 0.1\n\\end{align*}\\] The order is the same, given your \\(u\\). If your utility satisfies \\(u &lt; 0.1/0.11 = 0.909\\) you take the “riskier” gamble.\n\n\nExample 4.6 (Winner’s Curse) One of the interesting facts about expectation is that when you are in a competitive auctioning game then you shouldn’t value things based on pure expected value. You should take into consideration the event that you win \\(W\\). Really you should be calculating \\(E(X\\mid W)\\) rather than \\(E(X)\\).\nThe winner’s curse: given that you win, you should feel regret: \\(E(X\\mid W) &lt; E(X)\\).\nA good example is claiming racehorse whose value is uncertain.\n\n\n\nValue\nOutcome\n\n\n\n\n0\nhorse never wins\n\n\n50,000\nhorse improves\n\n\n\nSimple expected value tells you \\[\nE(X) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 50,000 = \\$25,000.\n\\] In a $20,000 claiming race (you can buy the horse for this fixed fee ahead of time from the owner) it looks like a simple decision to claim the horse.\nIt’s not so simple! We need to calculate a conditional expectation. What’s \\(E( X\\mid W )\\), given you win event (\\(W\\))? This is the expected value of the horse given that you win that is relevant to assessing your bid. In most situations \\(E(X\\mid W) &lt; 20,000\\).\nAnother related feature of this problem is asymmetric information. The owner or trainer of the horse may know something that you don’t know. There’s a reason why they are entering the horse into a claiming race in the first place.\nWinner’s curse implies that immediately after you have won, you should feel a little regret, as the object is less valuable to you after you have won! Or put another way, in an auction nobody else in the room is willing to offer more than you at that time.\n\n\nExample 4.7 (The Hat Problem) There are \\(N\\) prisoners in a forward facing line. Each guy is wearing a blue or red hat. Everyone can see all the hats in front of him, but cannot see his own hat. The hats can be in any combination of red and blue, from all red to all blue and every combination in between. The first guy doesn’t know his own hat.\nA guard is going to walk down the line, starting in the back, and ask each prisoner what color hat they have on. They can only answer “blue” or “red.” If they answer incorrectly, or say anything else, they will be shot dead on the spot. If they answer correctly, they will be set free. Each prisoner can hear all of the other prisoners’ responses, as well as any gunshots that indicate an incorrect response. They can remember all of this information.\nThere is a rule that all can agree to follow such that the first guy makes a choice (“My hat is …”) and everyone after that, including the last guy, will get their color right with probability \\(1\\). You have a \\(100\\)% chance of saving all but the last prisoner, and a \\(50\\)% chance of saving that one. Here’s the strategy the prisoners have agreed on. The last prisoner counts the number of blue hats worn; if the number is even, the last prisoner yells “blue”, if odd, yells “red”. If the \\(99\\)th prisoner hears “blue”, but counts an odd number of blue hats, then his hat must be blue so that the total number of blue hats is even. If he counts an even number of blue hats, then his hat must be red. If the last prisoner yells red, then 99 knows that there are an odd number of blue hats. So 99 counts the number of blue hats he can see. Again, if they are even, his hat is blue, if odd, his hat is red. The 99th prisoner then yells out the color of his hat and is spared. The next prisoner now knows whether the remaining number of blue hats, including his own, is odd or even, by taking into account whether 99 had a blue hat or not. Then by counting the number of blue hats he sees, he knows the color of his hat. So he yells out the color of his hat and is spared. This saves all but the last prisoner, and there is a \\(50\\)% chance that his hat is the color he shouted out.\nOne hundred prisoners are too many to work with. Suppose there are two. The last person can save the guy in front of him by shouting out the color of his hat. OK, how about if there are three? The third prisoner can see 0,1, or 2 blue hats. There seem to be three possibilities but only two choices of things to say. But, two of the possibilities have something in common namely the number of blue hats is even. So if the last prisoner yells “blue” then he can tell 1 and 2 that he sees an even number of blue hats. Then the second prisoner, by looking ahead and counting the number of blue hats, knows his must be blue if he sees one blue hat, and red if he sees no blue hats. The last prisoner agrees to yell “red” if the number of blue hats seen is odd. Then if 2 sees a blue hat on 1, his must be red, and if 1 has a red hat, his must be blue. By shouting out the color of his hat, 1 also knows his hat color. Two “blues” or two “reds” in a row mean he wears blue, while one blue and one red means he wears red. OK. This looks like this always works, because there are always only two possibilities as far as the number of blue hats worn they are either even or odd. So, check as in the three-person case that using this strategy (“blue” for an even number of blue hats “red” for an odd number) tells 99 the color of his hat, and then each prisoner in turn can learn the color of his hat by taking into account the parity of the number of blue hats he can see, the parity of the number of blue hats 100 saw and the number of prisoners behind him wearing blue hats.\n\n\nExample 4.8 (Lemon’s Problem) The lemon problem is an interesting conditional probability puzzle and is a classic example of asymmetric information in economics. It was first proposed by George Akerlof in his 1970 paper “The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism.” The problem highlights the importance of information in markets and how it can lead to adverse selection, where the quality of goods or services is lower than expected.\nThe basic tenet of the lemons principle is that low-value cars force high-value cars out of the market because of the asymmetrical information available to the buyer and seller of a used car. This is primarily due to the fact that a seller does not know what the true value of a used car is and, therefore, is not willing to pay a premium on the chance that the car might be a lemon. Premium-car sellers are not willing to sell below the premium price so this results in only lemons being sold.\nSuppose that a dealer pays $20K for a car and wants to sell for $25K. Some cars on the market are Lemons. The dealer knows whether a car is a lemon. A lemon is only worth $5K. There is asymmetric information as the customer doesn’t know if the particular new car is a lemon. S/he estimates the probability of lemons on the road by using the observed frequency of lemons. We will consider two separate cases:\n\nLet’s first suppose only 10% of cars are lemons.\nWe’ll then see what happens if 50% are lemons.\n\nThe question is how does the market clear (i.e. at what price do car’s sell). Or put another way does the customer buy the car and if so what price is agreed on? This is very similar to winner’s curse: when computing an expected value what conditioning information should I be taking into account?\nIn the case where the customer thinks that \\(p=0.10\\) of the car’s are lemons, they are willing to pay \\[\nE (X)= \\frac{9}{10} \\cdot 25 + \\frac{1}{10} \\cdot 5 = \\$ 23 K\n\\] This is greater than the initial $20 that the dealer paid. The car then sells at $23K \\(&lt;\\) $25K.\nOf course, the dealer is disappointed that there are lemons on the road as he is not achieving the full value – missing $2000. Therefore, they should try and persuade the customer its not a lemon by offering a warranty for example.\nThe more interesting case is when \\(p=0.5\\). The customer now values the car at \\[\nE (X)  = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 25 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 5 = \\$ 15K\n\\] This is lower than the $20K – the reservation price that the dealer would have for a good car. Now what type of car and at what price do they sell?\nThe key point in asymmetric information is that the customer must condition on the fact that if the dealer still wants to sell the car, the customer must update his probability of the type of the car. We already know that if the car is not a lemon, the dealer won’t sell under his initial cost of $20K. So at $15K he is only willing to sell a lemon. But then if the customer computes a conditional expectation \\(E( X \\mid \\mathrm{Lemon})\\) – conditioning on new information that the car is a lemon \\(L\\) we get the valuation \\[\nE ( X \\mid L ) = 1 \\cdot  5 = \\$ 5K\n\\] Therefore only lemons sell, at $ 5K, even if the dealer has a perfectly good car the customer is not willing to buy!\nAgain what should the dealer do? Try to raise the quality and decrease the frequency of lemons in the observable market. This type of modeling has all been used to understand credit markets and rationing in periods of loss of confidence.\n\n\nExample 4.9 (Envelope Paradox) The envelope paradox is a thought experiment or puzzle related to decision-making under uncertainty. It is also known as the “exchange paradox” or the “two-envelope paradox.” The paradox highlights the importance of carefully considering the information available when making decisions under uncertainty and the potential pitfalls of making assumptions about unknown quantities.\nA swami puts \\(m\\) dollars in one envelope and \\(2 m\\) in another. He hands on envelope to you and one to your opponent. The amounts are placed randomly and so there is a probability of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) that you get either envelope.\nYou open your envelope and find \\(x\\) dollars. Let \\(y\\) be the amount in your opponent’s envelope. You know that \\(y = \\frac{1}{2} x\\) or \\(y = 2 x\\). You are thinking about whether you should switch your opened envelope for the unopened envelope of your friend. It is tempting to do an expected value calculation as follows \\[\nE( y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot  \\frac{1}{2} x + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 x = \\frac{5}{4} x &gt; x\n\\] Therefore, it looks as if you should switch no matter what value of \\(x\\) you see. A consequence of this, following the logic of backwards induction, that even if you didn’t open your envelope that you would want to switch! Where’s the flaw in this argument?\nThis is an open-ended problem, but it will not be very confusing if we well understand both the frequentist and bayesian approaches. Actually, this is a very good example to show how these two approaches are different and to check if we understand them correctly. There many conditions in this problem, so we cannot argue everything in this example; instead, we are going to focus on some interesting cases. First, assume we’re risk-neutral (although, we can simply change “money” with “utility” in this paradox, so it doesn’t matter). We will compare frequentist/bayesian, open/not open, and discrete/continuous. The finite, or bounded space, case will not be considered here since they are not very interesting.\nIf I DO NOT look in my envelope, in this case, even from a frequentist viewpoint, we can find a fallacy in this naive expectation reasoning \\(E[trade] = 5X/4\\) . First, the right answer from a frequentist view is, loosely, as follows. If we switch the envelope, we can obtain \\(m\\) (when \\(X = m\\)) or lose \\(m\\) (when \\(X = 2m\\)) with the same probability \\(1/2\\). Thus, the value of a trade is zero, so that trading matters not for my expected wealth.\nInstead, naive reasoning is confusing the property of variables \\(x\\) and \\(m\\), \\(x\\) is a random variable and \\(m\\) is a fixed parameter which is constant (again, from a frequentist viewpoint). By trading, we can obtain \\(x\\) or lose \\(x/2\\) with the same probability. Here, the former \\(x=m\\) is different from the latter \\(X= 2m\\). Thus, \\(X \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{X}{2} \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{X}{4}\\) is the wrong expected value of trading. On the other hand, from a bayesian view, since we have no information, we are indifferent to either trading or not.\nThe second scenario is if I DO look in my envelope. As the Christensen & Utts (1992) article said, the classical view cannot provide a completely reasonable resolution to this case. It is just ignoring the information revealed. Also, the arbitrary decision rule introduced at the end of the paper or the extension of it commented by Ross (1996) are not the results of reasoning from a classical approach. However, the bayesian approach provides a systematic way of finding an optimal decision rule using the given information.\nWe can use the Bayes rule to update the probabilities of which envelope your opponent has! Assume \\(p(m)\\) of dollars to be placed in the envelope by the swami. Such an assumption then allows us to calculate an odds ratio \\[\n\\frac{ p \\left ( y = \\frac{1}{2} x | x \\right ) }{ p \\left ( y = 2 x | x \\right ) }\n\\] concerning the likelihood of which envelope your opponent has.\nThen, the expected value is given by \\[\nE(y\\mid x) =  p \\left ( y = \\frac{1}{2} x \\mid  x \\right ) \\cdot  \\frac{1}{2} x +\n  p \\left ( y = 2 x | x \\right ) \\cdot 2 x\n\\] and the condition \\(E(y) &gt; x\\) becomes a decision rule.\nLet \\(g(m)\\) be the prior distribution of \\(m\\). Applying Bayes’ theorem, we have \\[\np(m = x \\mid X = x) = \\frac{p(X = x \\mid m = x) g(x)}{p(X = x)} = \\frac{g(x)}{g(x)+g(x/2)}.\n\\] Similarly, we have \\[\np(m = x/2 \\mid X = x) = \\frac{p(X = x \\mid m = x/2) g(x/2)}{p(X = x/2)} = \\frac{g(x/2)}{g(x)+g(x/2)}.\n\\] The Bayesian can now compute his expected winnings from the two actions. If he keeps the envelope he has, he wins \\(x\\) dollars. If he trades envelopes, he wins \\(x/2\\) if he currently has the envelope with \\(2m\\) dollars, i.e., if \\(m = x/2\\) and he wins \\(2\\)x if he currently has the envelope with \\(m\\) dollars, i.e., \\(m = x\\). His expected winnings from a trade are \\[\nE(W\\mid Trade) = E(Y\\mid X = x) = \\frac{g(x/2)}{g(x)+g(x/2)} \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{g(x)}{g(x)+g(x/2)} 2x.\n\\] It is easily seen that when \\(g(x/2) = 2g(x)\\), \\(E(W\\mid Trade) = x\\). Therefore, if \\(g(x/2) &gt; 2g(x)\\) it is optimal to keep the envelope and if \\(g(x/2) &lt; 2g(x)\\) it is optimal to trade envelopes. For example, if your prior distribution on \\(m\\) is exponential \\(\\lambda\\), so that \\(g(m) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda m}\\), then it is easily seen that it is optimal to keep your envelope if \\(x &gt; 2\\log(2)/\\lambda\\).\nThe intuitive value of the expected winnings when trading envelopes was shown to be \\(5x/4\\). This value can be obtained by assuming that \\(g(x)/[g(x) + g(x/2)] =\n1/2\\) for all \\(x\\). In particular, this implies that \\(g(x) = g(x/2)\\) for all x, i.e., \\(g(x)\\) is a constant function. In other words, the intuitive expected winnings assumes an improper “noninformative” uniform density on \\([0, \\infty)\\). It is of interest to note that the improper noninformative prior for this problem gives a truly noninformative (maximum entropy) posterior distribution.\nMost of the arguments in the Christensen & Utts (1992) paper are right, but there is one serious error in the article which is corrected in Bachman-Christensen-Utts (1996) and discussed in Brams & Kilgour (1995). The paper calculated the marginal density of \\(X\\) like below. \\[\\begin{align*}\np(X = x) &= p(m = x)g(x) + p(2m = x)g(x/2) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} g(x) + \\frac{1}{2} g(x/2)\n\\end{align*}\\] where \\(g(x)\\) is the prior distribution of \\(m\\). However, integrating \\(p(X = x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\) from \\(0\\) to \\(\\infty\\) gives \\(3/2\\) instead of \\(1\\). In fact, their calculation of \\(p(X = x)\\) can hold only when the prior distribution \\(g(x)\\) is discrete and \\(p(X = x)\\), \\(g(m)\\), \\(g(m/2)\\) represent the probabilities that \\(X = x\\), \\(m = m\\), \\(m = m/2\\), respectively.\nFor the correct calculation of the continuous \\(X\\) case, one needs to properly transform the distribution. That can be done by remembering to include the Jacobian term alongside the transformed PDF, or by working with the CDF of \\(X\\) instead. The latter forces one to properly consider the transform, and we proceed with that method.\nLet \\(G(x)\\) be the CDF of the prior distribution of \\(m\\) corresponding to \\(g(x)\\). \\[\\begin{align*}\np(x &lt; X \\leq x+dx) &= p(m = x)dG(x)+ p(2m = x)dG(x/2) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} \\left( dG(x)+ dG(x/2) \\right)\n\\end{align*}\\] where \\(g(x) = dG(x)/dx\\). Now, the PDF of \\(X\\) is \\[\\begin{align*}\nf_X(x) &= \\frac{d}{dx} p(x &lt; X \\leq x + dx) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} \\left(g(x) + \\frac{1}{2} g(x/2) \\right)\n\\end{align*}\\] We have an additional \\(1/2\\) in the last term due to the chain rule, or the Jacobian in the change-in-variable formula. Therefore, the expected amount of a trade is \\[\\begin{align*}\nE(Y\\mid X = x) &= \\frac{x}{2} p(2m = x\\mid X = x) + 2 x \\, p(m = x\\mid X = x) \\\\\n&= \\frac{x}{2} \\frac{g(x)}{g(x) + g(x/2)/2} + 2 x \\frac{g(x/2)/2}{g(x) + g(x/2)/2} \\\\\n&=  \\frac{\\frac{x}{2}g(x) + x g(x/2)}{g(x) + g(x/2)/2}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThus, for the continuous case, trading is advantageous whenever \\(g(x/2) &lt; 4g(x)\\), instead of the decision rule for the discrete case \\(g(x/2) &lt; 2g(x)\\).\nNow, think about which prior will give you the same decision rule as the frequentist result. In the discrete case, \\(g(x)\\) such that \\(g(x/2) = 2g(x)\\), and in the continuous case \\(g(x)\\) such that \\(g(x/2) = 4g(x)\\). However, both do not look like useful, non-informative priors. Therefore, the frequentist approach does not always equal the Bayes approach with a non-informative prior. At the moment you start to treat \\(x\\) as a given number, and consider \\(p(m \\mid X = x)\\) (or \\(p(Y \\mid X = x)\\)), you are thinking in a bayesian way, and need to understand the implications and assumptions in that context.",

    "text": "4.3 Decision Trees\nDecision trees can effectively model and visualize conditional probabilities. They provide a structured way to break down complex scenarios into smaller, more manageable steps, allowing for clear calculations and interpretations of conditional probabilities.\nEach node in a decision tree, including the root, represents an event or condition. The branches represent the possible outcomes of that condition. Along each branch, you’ll often see a probability. This is the chance of that outcome happening, given the condition at the node. As you move down the tree, you’re looking at more specific conditions and their probabilities. The leaves of the tree show the final probabilities of various outcomes, considering all the conditions along the path to that leaf. Thus, the probabilities of the leaves need to sum to 1.\n\nExample 4.10 (Medical Testing) A patient goes to see a doctor. The doctor performs a test which is 95% sensitive – that is 95 percent of people who are sick test positive and 99% specific – that is 99 percent of the healthy people test negative. The doctor also knows that only 1 percent of the people in the country are sick. Now the question is: if the patient tests positive, what are the chances the patient is sick? The intuitive answer is 99 percent, but the correct answer is 66 percent.\nFormally, we have two binary variables, \\(D=1\\) that indicates you have a disease and \\(T=1\\) that indicates that you test positive for it. The estimates we know already are given by \\(P(D) = 0.02\\), \\(P(T\\mid D) = 0.95\\), and \\(P(\\bar T \\mid \\bar D) = 0.99\\). Here we used shortcut notations, instead of writing \\(P(D=1)\\) we used \\(P(D)\\) and instead of \\(P(D=0)\\) we wrote \\(P(\\bar D)\\).\nSometimes it is more intuitive to describe probabilities using a tree rather than tables. The tree below shows the conditional distribution of \\(D\\) and \\(T\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR\n    D --0.2--&gt; d1(D=1)\n    D --0.98--&gt; d0(D=0)\n    d1--0.95--&gt;t1(T=1)\n    d1 --0.05--&gt; t0(T=0)\n    d0--0.01--&gt;t10(T=1)\n    d0 --0.99--&gt; t00(T=0)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result is not as intuitive as in the NBA example. Let’s think about this intuitively. Rather than relying on Bayesian math to help us with this, let us consider another illustration. Imagine that the above story takes place in a small town, with \\(1,000\\) people. From the prior \\(P(D)=0.02\\), we know that 2 percent, or 20 people, are sick, and \\(980\\) are healthy. If we administer the test to everyone, the most probable result is that 19 of the 20 sick people test positive. Since the test has a 1 percent error rate, however, it is also probable that 9.8 of the healthy people test positive, we round it to 10.\nNow if the doctor sends everyone who tests positive to the national hospital, there will be 10 healthy and 19 sick patients. If you meet one, even though you are armed with the information that the patient tested positive, there is only a 66 percent chance this person is sick.\nLet’s extend the example and add the utility of the test and the utility of the treatment. Then the decision problem is to treat \\(a_T\\) or not to treat \\(a_N\\). The Q-function is the function of the state \\(S \\in \\{D_0,D_1\\}\\) and the action \\(A \\in \\{a_T,a_N\\}\\)\n\nUtility of the test and the treatment.\n\n\nA/S\n\\(a_T\\)\n\\(a_N\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(D_0\\)\n90\n100\n\n\n\\(D_1\\)\n90\n0\n\n\n\nThen expected utility of the treatment is 90 and no treatment is 98. A huge difference. Given our prior knowledge, we should not treat everyone.\n\n0.02*90 + 0.98*90  # treat\n\n 90\n\n0.02*0 + (1-0.02)*100 # do not treat\n\n 98\n\n\nHowever, the expected utility will change when our probability of disease changes. Let’s say that we are in a country where the probability of disease is 0.1 or we performed a test and updated our prior probability of disease to some number \\(p\\). Then the expected utility of the treatment is \\(E\\left[U(a_T)\\right] = 90\\) and no treatment is \\[\nE\\left[U(a_N)\\right] = 0\\cdot p + 100 \\cdot (1-p) = 100(1-p)\n\\] When we are unsure about the value of \\(p\\) we may want to explore how the optimal decision changes as we vary \\(p\\)\n\np = seq(0,1,0.01)\nplot(p, 100*(1-p), type = \"l\", xlab = \"p\", ylab = \"E[U(a)]\")\nabline(h=90, col=\"red\")\nlegend(\"bottomleft\", legend = c(TeX(\"$E[U(a_N)]$\"), \n      TeX(\"$E[U(a_T)]$\")), col = c(\"black\", \"red\"), lty = 1, bty='n')\n\n\n\n\nExpected utility of the treatment and no treatment as a function of the prior probability of disease.\n\n\n\n\nIf our estimate is at the crossover point, then we should be indifferent between treatment and no treatment, if on the left of the crossover point, we should treat, and if on the right, we should not treat. The crossover point is. \\[\n100(1-p) = 90, ~p = 0.1\n\\]\nThe gap of \\(90-100(1-p)\\) is the expected gain from treatment.\nNow, let us calculate the value of test, e.g. the change in expected utility from the test. We will need to calculate the posterior probabilities\n\n# P(D | T = 0) = P(T = 0 | D) P(D) / P(T = 0)\npdt0 = 0.05*0.02/(0.05*0.02 + 0.99*0.98) \nprint(pdt0)\n\n 0.001\n\n# Expected utility given the test is negative \n# E[U(a_N | T=0)]\nUN0 = pdt0*0 + (1-pdt0)*100\nprint(UN0)\n\n 100\n\n# E[U(a_T | T=0)]\nUT0 = pdt0*90 + (1-pdt0)*90\nprint(UT0)\n\n 90\n\n\nGiven test is negative, our best action is not to treat. Our utility is 100. What if the test is positive?\n\n# P(D | T = 1) = P(T = 1 | D) P(D) / P(T = 1)\npdt = 0.95*0.02/(0.95*0.02 + 0.01*0.98)\nprint(pdt)\n\n 0.66\n\n# E[U(a_N | T=1)]\nUN1 = pdt*0 + (1-pdt)*100\nprint(UN1)\n\n 34\n\n# E[U(a_T | T=1)]\nUT1 = pdt*90 + (1-pdt)*90\nprint(UT1)\n\n 90\n\n\nThe best option is to treat now! Given the test our strategy is to treat if the test is positive and not treat if the test is negative. Let’s calculate the expected utility of this strategy.\n\n# P(T=1) = P(T=1 | D) P(D) + P(T=1 | D=0) P(D=0)\npt = 0.95*0.02 + 0.01*0.98\nprint(pt)\n\n 0.029\n\n# P(T=0) = P(T=0 | D) P(D) + P(T=0 | D=0) P(D=0)\npt0 = 0.05*0.02 + 0.99*0.98\nprint(pt0)\n\n 0.97\n\n# Expected utility of the strategy\npt*UT1 + pt0*UN0\n\n 100\n\n\nThe utility of our strategy of 100 is above the strategy prior to testing (98), this difference of 2 is called the value of information.\n\n\nExample 4.11 (Mudslide) I live in a house that is at risk of being damaged by a mudslide. I can build a wall to protect it. The wall costs $10,000. If there is a mudslide, the wall will protect the house with probability \\(0.95\\). If there is no mudslide, the wall will not cause any damage. The prior probability of a mudslide is \\(0.01\\). If there is a mudslide and the wall does not protect the house, the damage will cost $100,0000. Should I build the wall?\nLet’s formally solve this as follows:\n\nBuild a decision tree.\nThe tree will list the probabilities at each node. It will also list any costs there are you going down a particular branch.\nFinally, it will list the expected cost of going down each branch, so we can see which one has the better risk/reward characteristics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR\n    B--\"Build: $40, $40.5\"--&gt;Y\n    B--\"Don't Build: $0, $10\"--&gt;N\n    Y--\"Slide: $0, $90\"--&gt;yy[Y]\n    Y--\"No slide $0, $40\"--&gt;40\n    N--\"Slide: $1000, $1000\"--&gt;1000\n    N--\"No slide $0, $0\"--&gt;0\n    yy --\"Hold: $0, $40\"--&gt;401[40]\n    yy --\"Not Hold: $1000, $1040\"--&gt;1040\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first dollar value is the cost of the edge, e.g. the cost of building the wall is $10,000. The second dollar value is the expected cost of going down that branch. For example, if you build the wall and there is a mudslide, the expected cost is $15,000. If you build the wall and there is no mudslide, the expected cost is $10,000. The expected cost of building the wall is $10,050. The expected cost of not building the wall is $1,000. The expected cost of building the wall is greater than the expected cost of not building the wall, so you should not build the wall. The dollar value at the leaf nodes is the expected cost of going down that branch. For example, if you build the wall and there is a mudslide and the wall does not hold, the expected cost is $110,000.\nThere’s also the possibility of a further test to see if the wall will hold. Let’s include the geological testing option. The test costs $3000 and has the following accuracies. \\[\nP( T  \\mid  \\mathrm{Slide} ) = 0.90 \\; \\; \\mathrm{and } \\; \\; P( \\mathrm{not~}T  \\mid\n\\mathrm{No \\; Slide} ) = 0.85\n\\] If you choose the test, then should you build the wall?\nLet’s use the Bayes rule. The initial prior probabilities are \\[\nP( Slide ) = 0.01  \\; \\; \\mathrm{and} \\; \\; P ( \\mathrm{No \\; Slide} ) = 0.99\n\\]\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nP( T) & = P( T  \\mid  \\mathrm{Slide} ) P( \\mathrm{Slide} ) +\nP( T  \\mid  \\mathrm{No \\;  Slide} ) P( \\mathrm{No \\; Slide} ) \\\\\nP(T)& = 0.90 \\times 0.01 + 0.15 \\times 0.99 = 0.1575\n\\end{align*}\\] We’ll use this to find our optimal course of action.\nThe posterior probability given a positive test is \\[\\begin{align*}\nP ( Slide  \\mid  T ) & = \\frac{ P ( T  \\mid  Slide ) P ( Slide )}{P(T)} \\\\\n& = \\frac{ 0.90 \\times 0.01}{ 0.1575} = 0.0571\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe posterior probability given a negative test is \\[\\begin{align*}\nP \\left ( \\mathrm{Slide}  \\mid  \\mathrm{not~}T \\right ) & = \\frac{ P ( \\mathrm{not~}T  \\mid  \\mathrm{Slide} ) P ( \\mathrm{Slide} )}{P(\\mathrm{not~}T)} \\\\\n& = \\frac{0.1 \\times 0.01 }{0.8425} \\\\\n& =0.001187\n\\end{align*}\\]\nCompare this to the initial base rate of a \\(1\\)% chance of having a mud slide.\nGiven that you build the wall without testing, what is the probability that you’ll lose everything?

    "section": "4.4 Nash Equilibrium",
    "text": "4.4 Nash Equilibrium\nWhen multiple decision makers interact with each other, meaning the decision of one player changes the state of the “world” and thus affects the decision of another player, then we need to consider the notion of equilibrium. It is a central concept in economics and game theory. The most widely used type of equilibrium is the Nash equilibrium, named after John Nash, who introduced it in his 1950 paper “Equilibrium Points in N-Person Games.” It was popularized by the 1994 film “A Beautiful Mind,” which depicted Nash’s life and work.\nIt is defined as a set of strategies where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy, assuming others keep their strategies constant. In other words, a Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies where no player has an incentive to deviate from their current strategy, given the strategies of the other players.\nHere are a few examples of Nash equilibria:\n\nPrisoner’s Dilemma: Two prisoners must decide whether to cooperate with each other or defect. The Nash equilibrium is for both to defect, even though they would be better off if they both cooperated.\nPricing Strategies: Firms in a market choose prices to maximize profits, taking into account their competitors’ pricing decisions. The equilibrium is the set of prices where no firm can increase profits by changing its price unilaterally.\nTraffic Flow: Drivers choose routes to minimize travel time, based on their expectations of other drivers’ choices. The equilibrium is the pattern of traffic flow where no driver can reduce their travel time by choosing a different route.\n\n\nExample 4.12 (Marble Game) Here is a subtle marble game where players have to call out (or present) either red or blue with different payoffs according to how things match. Two players \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have both a red and a blue marble. They present one marble to each other. The payoff table is as follows:\n\nIf both present red, \\(A\\) wins $3.\nIf both present blue, \\(A\\) wins $1.\nIf the colors do not match, \\(B\\) wins $2\n\nThe question is whether it is better to be \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) or does it matter? Moreover, what kind of strategy should you play? A lot depends on how much credit you give your opponent. A lot of empirical research was done on the tit-for-tat strategy, where you cooperate until your opponent defects. Then you match his last response.\nNash equilibrium will also allow us to study the concept of a randomized strategy (ie. picking a choice with a certain probability) which turns out to be optimal in many game theory problems.\nFirst, assume that the players have a \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) probability of playing Red or Blue. Thus each player has the same expected payoff \\(E(A) = \\$1\\) \\[\\begin{align*}\n    E(A) &= \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 3 + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 1 =1 \\\\\n    E(B) &= \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 2 + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 2 =1\n\\end{align*}\\] We might go one step further and look at the risk (and measured by a standard deviation) and calculate the variances of each player’s payouts. \\[\\begin{align*}\n    Var (A) & = (1-1)^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} +(3-1)^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} + (0-1)^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 1.5 \\\\\n    Var(B) & = 1^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + (2-1)^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 1\n\\end{align*}\\] Therefore, under this scenario, if you are risk averse, player \\(B\\) position is favored.\nThe matrix of probabilities with equally likely choices is given by\n\n\n\n\\(A,B\\)\nProbability\n\n\n\n\n\\(P( red, red )\\)\n(1/2)(1/2)=1/4\n\n\n\\(P( red, blue )\\)\n(1/2)(1/2)=1/4\n\n\n\\(P( blue, red )\\)\n(1/2)(1/2)=1/4\n\n\n\\(P( blue, blue )\\)\n(1/2)(1/2)=1/4\n\n\n\nNow there is no reason to assume ahead of time that the players will decide to play \\(50/50\\). We will show that there’s a mixed strategy (randomized) that is a Nash equilibrium that is, both players won’t deviate from the strategy. We’ll prove that the following equilibrium happens:\n\n\\(A\\) plays Red with probability 1/2 and blue 1/2\n\\(B\\) plays Red with probability 1/4 and blue 3/4\n\nIn this case the expected payoff to playing Red equals that of playing Blue for each player. We can simply calculate: \\(A\\)’s expected payoff is 3/4 and \\(B\\)’s is $1 \\[\nE(A) = \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot 3 + \\frac{3}{8} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\] Moreover, \\(E(B) =1\\), thus \\(E(B) &gt; E(A)\\). We see that \\(B\\) is the favored position. It is clear that if I know that you are going to play this strategy and vice-versa, neither of us will deviate from this strategy – hence the Nash equilibrium concept.\nNash equilibrium probabilities are: \\(p=P( A \\; red )= 1/2, p_1 = P( B \\; red ) = 1/4\\) with payout matrix\n\n\n\n\\(A,B\\)\nProbability\n\n\n\n\n\\(P( red, red )\\)\n(1/2)(1/4)=1/8\n\n\n\\(P( red, blue )\\)\n(1/2)(3/4)=3/8\n\n\n\\(P( blue, red )\\)\n(1/2)(1/4)=1/8\n\n\n\\(P( blue, blue )\\)\n(1/2)(3/4)=3/8\n\n\n\nWe have general payoff probabilities: \\(p=P( A \\; red ), p_1 = P( B \\; red )\\)\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    f_A ( p , p_1 ) =& 3 p p_1 + ( 1 -p ) ( 1 - p_1 ) \\\\\n    f_B ( p , p_1 ) =& 2 \\{ p(1 - p_1) + ( 1 -p ) p_1 \\}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nTo find the equilibrium point \\[\\begin{align*}\n    ( \\partial / \\partial p ) f_A ( p , p_1 ) =& 3 p_1 - ( 1 - p_1 ) = 4 p_1 -1 \\; \\; \\mathrm{so} \\; \\; p_1= 1/4 \\\\\n    ( \\partial / \\partial p_1 ) f_B ( p , p_1 ) =& 2 ( 1 - 2p ) \\; \\; \\mathrm{so} \\; \\; p= 1/2\n\\end{align*}\\]\nMuch research has been directed to repeated games versus the one-shot game and is too large a topic to discuss further.\n\nEquilibrium analysis helps predict the likely outcomes of strategic interactions, even when individuals are acting in their own self-interest. Further, we can use it to understand how markets function and how firms make pricing and production decisions or to design mechanisms (e.g., auctions, voting systems) that incentivize desired behavior and achieve efficient outcomes.\nOne major drawback is that equilibrium analysis relies on assumptions about rationality and common knowledge of preferences and strategies, which may not always hold in real-world situations. Furthermore, some games may have multiple equilibria, making it difficult to predict which one will be reached. The problem of dynamic strategies, when individuals may learn and adjust their strategies as they gain experience, is hard.",

    "section": "4.5 Statistical Decisions and Risk",
    "text": "4.5 Statistical Decisions and Risk\nThe statistical decision making problem can be posed as follows. A decision maker (you) has to chose from a set of decisions or acts. The consequences of these decisions depend on an unknown state of the world. Let \\(d\\in\\mathcal{D}\\) denote the decision and \\(\\theta\\in\\Theta\\) the state of the world. As an example, think of \\(\\theta\\) as the unknown parameter and the decision as choosing a parameter estimation or hypothesis testing procedure. To provide information about the parameter, the decision maker obtains a sample \\(y\\in\\mathcal{Y}\\) that is generated from the likelihood function \\(p\\left(y|\\theta\\right)\\). The resulting decision depends on the observed data, is denoted as \\(d\\left(  y\\right)\\), and is commonly called the decision rule.\nTo make the decision, the decision maker uses a “loss” function as a quantitative metric to assesses the consequences or performance of different decisions. For each state of the world \\(\\theta\\), and decision \\(d\\), \\(\\mathcal{L}\\left(  \\theta,d\\right)\\) quantifies the “loss” made by choosing \\(d\\) when the state of the world is \\(\\theta.\\) Common loss functions include a quadratic loss, \\(\\mathcal{L}(\\theta,d)=(\\theta-d)^{2},\\) an absolute loss, \\(\\mathcal{L}(\\theta,d)=|\\theta-d|\\), and a \\(0-1\\) loss, \\[\n\\mathcal{L}(\\theta,d)=L_{0}1_{\\left[  \\theta\\in\\Theta_{0}\\right]  }+L_{1}1_{\\left[  \\theta\\in\\Theta_{1}\\right]  }.\n\\] For Bayesians, the utility function provides a natural loss function. Historically, decision theory was developed by classical statisticians, thus the development in terms of “objective” loss functions instead of “subjective” utility.\nClassical decision theory takes a frequentist approach, treating parameters as “fixed but unknown” and evaluating decisions based on their population properties. Intuitively, this thought experiment entails drawing a dataset \\(y\\) of given length and applying the same decision rule in a large number of repeated trials and averaging the resulting loss across those hypothetical samples. Formally, the classical risk function is defined as \\[\nR(\\theta,d)=\\int_{\\mathcal{Y}}\\mathcal{L}\\left[  \\theta,d(y)\\right]  p(y|\\theta )dy=\\mathbb{E}\\left[  \\mathcal{L}\\left[  \\theta,d(y)\\right]  |\\theta\\right]  .\n\\] Since the risk function integrates over the data, it does not depend on a given observed sample and is therefore an ex-ante or a-priori metric. In the case of quadratic loss, the risk function is the mean-squared error (MSE) and is \\[\\begin{align*}\nR(\\theta,d)  &  =\\int_{\\mathcal{Y}}\\left[  \\theta-d\\left(  y\\right)  \\right]\n^{2}p(y|\\theta)dy\\\\\n&  =\\mathbb{E}\\left[  \\left(  d\\left(  y\\right)  -E\\left[  d\\left(  y\\right)\n|\\theta\\right]  \\right)  ^{2}|\\theta\\right]  +\\mathbb{E}\\left[  \\left(\nE\\left[  d\\left(  y\\right)  |\\theta\\right]  -\\theta\\right)  ^{2}|\\theta\\right]\n\\\\\n&  =Var\\left(  d\\left(  y\\right)  |\\theta\\right)  +\\left[  bias\\left(\nd\\left(  y\\right)  -\\theta\\right)  \\right]  ^{2}%\n\\end{align*}\\] which can be interpreted as the bias of the decision/estimator plus the variance of the decision/estimator. Common frequentist estimators choose unbiased estimators so that the bias term is zero, which in most settings leads to unique estimators.\nThe goal of the decision maker is to minimize risk. Unfortunately, rarely is there a decision that minimizes risk uniformly for all parameter values. To see this, consider a simple example of \\(y\\sim N\\left(  \\theta,1\\right)\\), a quadratic loss, and two decision rules, \\(d_{1}\\left(  y\\right)  =0\\) or \\(d_{2}\\left(  y\\right)  =y\\). Then, \\(R\\left(  \\theta,d_{1}\\right)  =\\theta^{2}\\) and \\(R\\left(  \\theta,d_{2}\\right)  =1\\). If \\(\\left\\vert \\theta\\right\\vert &lt;1\\), then \\(R\\left(  \\theta,d_{1}\\right)  &lt;R\\left(  \\theta,d_{2}\\right)\\), with the ordering reversed for \\(\\left\\vert \\theta\\right\\vert &gt;1\\). Thus, neither rule uniformly dominates the other.\nOne way to deal with the lack of uniform domination is to use the minimax principle: first maximize risk as function of \\(\\theta\\), \\[\n\\theta^{\\ast}=\\underset{\\theta\\in\\Theta}{\\arg\\max}R(\\theta,d)\\text{,}%\n\\] and then minimize the resulting risk by choosing a decision:\n\\[\nd_{m}^{\\ast}=\\underset{d\\in\\mathcal{D}}{\\arg\\min}\\left[  R(\\theta^{\\ast },d)\\right]  \\text{.}%\n\\] The resulting decision is known as a minimax decision rule. The motivation for minimax is game theory, with the idea that the statistician chooses the best decision rule against the other player, mother nature, who chooses the worst parameter.\nThe Bayesian approach treats parameters as random and specifies both a likelihood and prior distribution, denoted here by \\(\\pi\\left(  \\theta\\right)\\). The Bayesian decision maker recognizes that both the data and parameters are random, and accounts for both sources of uncertainty when calculating risk. The Bayes risk is defined as\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nr(\\pi,d)  &  =\\int_{\\mathcal{\\Theta}}\\int_{\\mathcal{Y}}\\mathcal{L}\\left[  \\theta ,d(y)\\right]  p(y|\\theta)\\pi\\left(  \\theta\\right)  dyd\\theta\\\\\n&  =\\int_{\\mathcal{\\Theta}}R(\\theta,d)\\pi\\left(  \\theta\\right)  d\\theta =\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[  R(\\theta,d)\\right]  ,\n\\end{align*}\\] and thus the Bayes risk is an average of the classical risk, with the expectation taken under the prior distribution. The Bayes decision rule minimizes expected risk:\n\\[\nd_{\\pi}^{\\ast}=\\underset{d\\in\\mathcal{D}}{\\arg\\min}\\text{ }r(\\pi,d)\\text{.}%\n\\] The classical risk of a Bayes decision rule is defined as \\(R\\left(\n\\theta,d_{\\pi}^{\\ast}\\right)\\), where \\(d_{\\pi}^{\\ast}\\) does not depend on \\(\\theta\\) or \\(y\\). Minimizing expected risk is consistent with maximizing posterior expected utility or, in this case, minimizing expected loss. Expected posterior risk is \\[\nr(\\pi,d)=\\int_{\\mathcal{Y}}\\left[  \\int_{\\mathcal{\\Theta}}\\mathcal{L}\\left[\n\\theta,d(y)\\right]  p(y|\\theta)\\pi\\left(  \\theta\\right)  d\\theta\\right]  dy,\n\\] where the term in the brackets is posterior expected loss. Minimizing posterior expected loss for every \\(y\\in\\mathcal{Y},\\) is clearly equivalent to minimizing posterior expected risk, provided it is possibility to interchange the order of integration.\nThe previous definitions did not explicitly state that the prior distribution was proper, that is, that \\(\\int_{\\mathcal{\\Theta}}\\pi\\left(  \\theta\\right)d\\theta=1\\). In some applications and for some parameters, researchers may use priors that do not integrate, \\(\\int_{\\Theta}\\pi\\left(  \\theta\\right)d\\theta=\\infty\\), commonly called improper priors. A generalized Bayes rule is one that minimizes \\(r(\\pi,d),\\) where \\(\\pi\\) is not necessarily a distribution, if such a rule exists. If \\(r(\\pi,d)&lt;\\infty\\), then the mechanics of this rule is clear, although its meaning is less clear.\n\n\n\n\nKelly, J.

    "text": "5.1 Confidence Intervals\nThe Internet age opened the door to enormous data collection from images to videos as well as personalized information. The data collected are observational rather than data collected from designed experiments—where we can control the environment to find the effects of interventions.\nAny competitive business strives to improve its efficiency. Requirements to improve can be driven by changing market conditions, customer behavior, and their demands. We would like to test our ideas on how to improve things and pick the best course of action. AB testing provides a statistical framework for addressing such issues. It is the underpinning for testing new ideas and measuring the effects of strategy A versus strategy B. It is widely used for testing marketing campaigns, product designs, or even the effects of new drugs. It relies on a statistical procedure sometimes known as hypothesis testing, hence AB testing allows us to draw conclusions from controlled designed experiments. We would also like to use these methods on observational studies and thus bring up questions of causation. Instrumental variables provide ways of trying to tease out main effects. Propensity scores and matching are also popular techniques. We are often interested in whether the observed effect is due to noise or a true effect. We can use hypothesis testing to answer this question in a rigorous way. Think of a coin tossing experiment. If you tossed a coin twice and it came up heads both times, does it mean that the coin is biased? Common sense tells us that two tosses are not enough to make a definitive conclusion and we should toss this coin a few more times to gain confidence. Hypothesis testing is just that—the procedure that tells us if we have enough evidence to make a conclusion or if more data is required. It uses probability distributions to quantify uncertainty about experiment outcomes. Let’s do a more practical example.\nThere is a whole field on bandit problems—how to optimally sequentially allocate our resources as a trade-off between exploitation (gaining more information in an environment you understand to solely gain efficiency) or exploration (learning about new environments which might be less optimal than the current one).\nYou work as a quant for a trading firm and you have developed a new algorithm to trade stocks. You tested your algorithm on historical data and it outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithm used in your company. Now, the important question is whether your trading strategy can truly outperform the market or it just got lucky. We need to analyze the performance of the algorithm after it was created and decide whether we have truly discovered a dominant strategy. Sequential analysis—a natural framework for Bayesian methods—allows us to decide how long we need to wait before we have enough evidence that our algorithm has an edge.\nThe effect we try to measure is usually present in some statistics that we calculate from data, for example, sample mean, proportion, or difference in means.\nCentral Limit Theorem\nCLT states that, given a sufficiently large sample size, the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. This normal distribution is also known as the Gaussian distribution. The theorem applies to a wide range of population distributions, including distributions that are not normal. This universality makes it one of the most powerful and widely-used theorems in statistics.\nThe first and simplest case of the CLT was published in 1738 by de Moivre and is called the De Moivre-Laplace theorem. According to this theorem the standard normal distribution arises as the limit of scaled and centered Binomial distributions, in the following sense. Let \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\) be independent, identically distributed Rademacher random variables, that is, independent random variables with distribution \\[\nP(X_i = 1) = P(X_i = -1) = \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\] Then, the distribution of the sum of these random variables converges to the standard normal distribution as \\(n\\) tends to infinity. That is, for any \\(a&lt;b\\), we have \\[\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} P\\left(a \\le \\frac{x_1+\\cdots+x_n}{\\sqrt{n}} \\le b\\right) = \\int_a^b \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-x^2/2} dx.\n\\] In this case, the sum \\(x_1+\\cdots+x_n\\) has mean \\(n\\mu\\) and variance \\(n\\sigma^2\\), so that the standardized sum \\((X_1+\\cdots+X_n - n\\mu)/\\sqrt{n\\sigma^2}\\) has mean \\(0\\) and variance \\(1\\). The theorem then states that the distribution of this standardized sum converges to the standard normal distribution as \\(n\\) tends to infinity.\nIn 1889 Francis Galton published a paper where he described what we now call the Galton Board. The Galton Board is a vertical board with interleaved rows of pins. Balls are dropped from the top, and bounce left and right as they hit the pins. Eventually, they are collected into one of several bins at the bottom. The distribution of balls in the bins approximates the normal distribution. Each pin is a physical realization of the binomial draw and each row is a summand. The location at the bottom is a sum of the binomial draws. The galton-ball.r script simulates the Galton board experiment. The script is available in the R folder of the book repository. Figure 5.1 shows the result of the simulation. The distribution of the balls in the bins approximates the normal distribution.\nThe fact that the distribution of the simulated means from the Pyx example can be described well by a normal bell curve, in fact has a theoretical justification. It is called the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem states that, given a sufficiently large sample size, the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. This normal distribution is also known as the Gaussian distribution.\nThere are a few conditions. The sampled observations must be independent. In practice, this means that the sampling should be random, and one observation should not influence another. Further, the sample size should be sufficiently large. While there is no strict rule for what constitutes ‘large enough,’ a common guideline is a sample size of 30 or more. However, if the population distribution is far from normal, a larger sample size may be required.\nWe can estimate the mean of this bell curve using \\(\\bar x\\) and the standard deviation (standard error) using \\(s/\\sqrt{n}\\).\nThe square-root nature of this relation is somewhat unfortunate. To double your certainty about the population mean, you need to quadruple the sample size.\nOne of the main applications of this result is the construction of confidence intervals. A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true value of the population mean. It is a plausible range for the quantity we are trying to estimate. The confidence interval is calculated using the sample mean \\(\\bar x\\) and the standard error \\(s/\\sqrt{n}\\). The confidence interval is centered around the sample mean and has a width of \\(2 \\times s_{\\bar x}\\). The confidence interval is calculated as follows \\[\n\\bar x \\pm 1.96s_{\\bar x}, ~ s_{\\bar x} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}.\n\\]\nThe theorem applies to a wide range of population distributions, including distributions that are not normal. This universality makes it one of the most powerful and widely-used theorems in statistics.\nHere are a few conclusions we can make thus far\nComing back to the Patriots coin toss example, we know that they won 19 out of 25 tosses during the 2014-2015 season. In this example, our observations are values 0 (lost toss) and 1 (won toss) and the average over those 0-1 observations is called the proportion and is denoted by \\(\\hat p\\) instead of \\(\\bar x\\). When we deal with proportions, we can calculate the sample variance from its mean \\(\\hat p\\) as follows \\[\ns^2_{\\hat p} = \\frac{\\hat p(1-\\hat p)}{n}.\n\\] Thus, we know that given our observations and CLT, the true value of the probability of winning a toss is normally distributed. Our best guess at the mean \\(\\hat p\\) is \\(19/25 = 0.76\\) and variance \\(s^2 = 0.76(1-0.76)/25 = 0.0073\\) \\[\n\\hat p \\sim N(0.76, 0.0073).\n\\] Then a \\(95\\%\\) Confidence Interval is calculated by\n0.76 + c(-1.96,1.96)*sqrt(0.0073)\n\n## [1] 0.59 0.93\nSince 0.5 is outside the confidence interval, we say that we do not have enough evidence to say that the coin tosses were fair.\nThen we formulate a hypothesis that we are to test. Our status-quo assumption (there is no effect) is called the null hypothesis and is typically denoted by \\(H_0\\).\nTo translate the question from this experiment into language of hypothesis testing, we say that our null hypothesis is that proportion of yawning participants in control (\\(\\hat p_c\\)) and experimental group (\\(\\hat p_e\\)) is the same \\(H_0: \\hat p_c - \\hat p_e = 0\\), and the alternative hypothesis is \\(H_a: \\hat p_c &lt; \\hat p_e\\). The goal is to use the data to tell us if the hypothesis is correct or not.\nA key statistical fact behind the hypothesis testing is the Central Limit Theorem. It states that if we have a sample \\(\\{x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\}\\) with \\(n\\) observations from any distribution \\(x_i \\sim p(x)\\), then the average of the sample follows a Normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2/n\\) \\[\n\\bar X = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2/n)\n\\]\nLet us use a simple simulated data set to demonstrate the central limit theorem. We generate 100 outcomes of a Bernoulli trial with \\(p=0.3\\) and calculate the mean of this sample \\(\\hat p\\). We repeat it 2000 times and compare the empirical distribution of \\(\\hat p\\) with \\(N(0.3, 0.046)\\).\nset.seed(1)\na = replicate(2000,mean(rbinom(100,1,0.3)))\nplot(density(a), main=\"\")\nse = sqrt(0.3*(1-0.3)/100)  #  0.046\nx = seq(0,0.5,length.out = 300)\nlines(x,dnorm(x,mean = 0.3,sd = se), col=\"red\", lwd=3)\nThere are three ways to quantify uncertainty in hypothesis testing. The first approach relies on calculating confidence intervals, as we did for the yawn example. There are two complementary approaches. One is to calculate what is called a \\(p\\)-value, that is the probability of getting the result observed in the data, assuming null-hypothesis is true. If \\(p\\)-value is low, then we reject the null-hypothesis. For the yawn example, the conditional probability that the observed difference in proportions is greater than 0.044, given null hypothesis is true is given by\n\\[\np\\text{-value} = P(\\hat p_e - \\hat p_c \\ge 0.044 \\mid H_0),\n\\] which can be calculated using pnorm function\n1 - pnorm(0.044,0,sqrt(0.0177))     \n\n## [1] 0.37\nThe \\(p\\)-value of 0.37 means that there is a 37% chance to observe the difference to be greater than 0.044 assuming the null-hypothesis. It is quite high! We want the \\(p\\)-value to be low, only then we can claim that we have discovered a new fact, i.e. that yawning is contagious. In many applications we require this number to be at most 0.005. The smallest acceptable \\(p\\)-value is called the significance level and is typically denoted as \\(\\alpha\\). We can test the hypothesis at different levels of significance \\(\\alpha\\). Further we assume that the statistic we are analyzing follows the sampling distribution. The probability distribution of the statistics values is either Normal, or \\(t\\)-distribution for continuous variable.\nIn a nutshell a hypothesis is a statement about a population developed for the purpose of testing with data. To summarize the process of testing a significance of our discovery for proportions, we perform the hypothesis testing following the 5-step process.\nStep 1: Formulate the Null Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)), which we assume to be true unless there is sufficient evidence to the contrary. Then, alternative Hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)): test against the null, e.g. \\(H_0: p_e - p_c = 0\\), and \\(H_a: p_e - p_c &gt; 0\\). If there is evidence that \\(H_0\\) is false, we accept \\(H_1\\).\nStep 2: Select the significance level \\(\\alpha\\). While \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) (the 5% level) is the most commonly used, \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\) (the 1% level) is prevalent in medical and quality assurance examples.\nStep 3: Compute the Test Statistic (\\(Z\\) or \\(T\\))\nStep 4: Formulate the Decision Rule. For example, reject the Null hypothesis if \\(|Z| &gt; 1.96\\)\nStep 5: Make a Decision, Compute the p-value. p-value is the smallest significance level at which a null hypothesis can be rejected. If \\(p\\)-value \\(&lt;\\alpha\\), we have evidence that \\(H_1\\) is true, we accept \\(H_1\\) and claim we have a discovery. If \\(p\\)-value is \\(\\ge \\alpha\\), then we cannot reject the null-hypothesis.\nIn Steps 1-2 we formulate the hypothesis. In steps 3-5 we make a decision.\nIn the context of hypothesis testing, we come back to the type I and type II errors we already discussed. They can be used to describe two types of errors you can make when testing\nAnd the significance level is then \\[\nP(\\mbox{reject } H_0 \\mid H_0 \\; \\mbox{ true}) =\nP(\\mbox{type I error}).\n\\]\nHypothesis testing is often used in scientific reporting. For example, the discovery of Higgs Boson was announced as a result of hypothesis testing. Scientists used the five-sigma concept to test the Higgs-Boson hypothesis. This concept, however, is somewhat counter-intuitive. If the particle doesn’t exist, one in 3.5 million is the chance an experiment just like the one announced would nevertheless come up with a result appearing to confirm it does exist. In other words, one in 3.5 million is the likelihood of finding a false positive—a fluke produced by random statistical fluctuation that seems as definitive as the findings released by two teams of researchers at the CERN laboratory in Geneva. So we can talk about the significance level as \\(p\\)-value to be one-in-3.5-million and then the \\(Z\\)-score is five.\nThe test statistic (\\(T\\) or \\(Z\\)) quantifies uncertainty between the null-hypothesis value and the observed one and is equal to the number of standard deviations they are apart from each other. This value is called the \\(Z\\)-score, and is calculated as \\[\nZ = \\frac{ \\bar{x} - \\mu_0 }{s/\\sqrt{n}},\n\\] where \\(\\mu_0\\) is the mean assumed under null-hypothesis. The square root of the statistic’s variance \\(s/\\sqrt{n}\\) is called standard error and is denoted by \\(se(\\bar X)\\).\nLet’s calculate the \\(Z\\)-score for the yawning example. l-in \\(\\mu_0 = 0\\), \\(\\hat{p} = \\hat p_e - \\hat p_c = 0.044\\), \\(\\Var{\\hat p }=\\Var{\\hat p_e - \\hat p_c} = 0.0177\\), we get \\(Z\\) statistic to be 0.33. Thus, our observed difference is very close to 0.\nTo summarize the duality of confidence interval, \\(p\\)-value and \\(Z\\)-score, the following statements are equivalent:\nLet us proceed with another example.",

    "text": "Mean estimates are based on random samples and therefore random (uncertain) themselves\nWe need to account for this uncertainty!\nStandard Error measures the uncertainty of an estimate\nUsing properties of the Normal distribution, we can construct \\(95\\)% Confidence Intervals\nThis provides us with a plausible range for the quantity we are trying to estimate.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.5 (Mythbusters) In 2006 the creators of Mythbusters TV show on Discovery channel wanted to test whether yawning is contagious in humans. They recruited 50 participants and each of those went through an interview. At the end of 34 randomly selected interviews the interviewer did yawn. Then participants were asked to wait in a next door room. Out of 34 participants from the experimental group, 10 did yawn (29.4%) and only 4 out of 16 (25%) in the control group did yawn. The difference in the proportion of those who did yawn was 4.4%. The show hosts Kari Byron, Tory Belleci and Scottie Chapman concluded that yawn is indeed contagious.\nThe question is what happens if we are to re-run this experiment several times with different groups of participants, will we see the same difference of 4.4%? The fact is that from one experiment to another calculated proportions of yawners in both groups will be different.\nIn our example, the proportion of yawners in the experimental group is \\(\\hat p_e = 0.294\\) and in the control group is \\(\\hat p_c = 0.25\\). Thus, \\[\n\\hat \\sigma^2_e = 0.294(1-0.294) = 0.208,~~~\\hat \\sigma^2_c = 0.25(1-0.25) = 0.188\n\\]\nWe can apply CLT and calculate the uncertainty about \\(\\hat p_{e}\\) and \\(\\hat p_{c}\\) \\[\n\\hat p_e\\sim N(0.294, 0.208/34),~~~ \\hat p_c\\sim N(0.25, 0.188/16).\n\\] Now, instead of comparing proportions (numbers), we can compare their distributions and thus quantify uncertainties. If we plot density functions of those two Normal variables, we can see that although means are different, there is a large overlap of the two density functions.\n\np = seq(0.0,0.6, length.out = 200)\nplot(p,dnorm(p,0.25, sqrt(0.188/16)), col=2, type='l', lwd=3, ylab=\"Density\", ylim = c(0,5))\nlines(p,dnorm(p,0.294, sqrt(0.208/34)), col=3, lwd=3, ylim = c(0, 6))\nlegend(\"topright\", c(\"control\", \"experiment\"), col=c(3,2), lwd=3, bty='n')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amount of overlap is the measure of how certain we are that \\(p_e\\) and \\(p_c\\) are different. Large overlap means we are not very certain if proportions are truly different. For example, both \\(p_e\\) and \\(p_c\\) have a high probability of being between 0.2 and 0.4. We can use properties of normal distribution to say specifically what is the amount of this overlap by calculating the corresponding 95% confidence interval of the difference between the proportions. Note that the difference of two Normal random variables is another Normal \\[\n\\hat p_e - \\hat p_c \\sim N(0.294 - 0.25, 0.208/34 + 0.188/16) = N(0.044, 0.0177)\n\\] Now we can calculate 95% confidence interval for \\(\\hat p_e - \\hat p_c\\), again using properties of Normal\n\n0.044 + c(-1.96,1.96)*sqrt(0.0177)\n\n## [1] -0.22  0.30\n\n\nThe interval is wide and most importantly, it does contain 0. Thus, we cannot say for sure that the proportions are different. They might just appear to be different due to chance (sampling error). Meaning, that if we are to re-run the experiment we should expect the difference to be anywhere between -0.22 and 0.31 in 95% of the cases.\nThus, statistical analysis does not confirm the conclusion made by the show hosts and indicates that there is no evidence that the proportion of yawners is different between the control and experimental groups.\n\n\nExample 5.6 (Search algorithm) Let’s look at another example and test effectiveness of Google’s new search algorithm. We measure effectiveness by the number of users who clicked on one of the search results. As users send the search requests, they will be randomly processed with Algo 1 or Algo 2. We wait until 2500 search requests were processed by each of the algorithms and calculate the following table based on how often people clicked through\n\nGoogle Search Algorithm\n\n\n\nAlgo1\nAlgo2\n\n\n\n\nsuccess\n1755\n1828\n\n\nfailure\n745\n682\n\n\ntotal\n2500\n2500\n\n\n\nThe probability of success is estimated to be \\(\\hat{p}_1 = 1755/2500 = 0.702\\) for the current algorithm and \\(\\hat{p}_2 = 1828/2500 = 0.731\\) for the new algorithm. We can calculate the 95% confidence interval or 95% Bayesian credible region for both estimated proportions.\n\np1 = 1755/2500; p2 = 1828/2500\nAlgo1 = round(p1 + c(-1.96,1.96)*sqrt(p1*(1-p1)/2500), 3)\nAlgo2 = round(p2 + c(-1.96,1.96)*sqrt(p2*(1-p2)/2500), 3)\nkable(rbind(Algo1, Algo2), col.names = c(\"Lower\", \"Upper\"), caption = \"95% Confidence Interval for the Proportions\")\n\n\n95% Confidence Interval for the Proportions\n\n\n\nLower\nUpper\n\n\n\n\nAlgo1\n0.68\n0.72\n\n\nAlgo2\n0.71\n0.75\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that the intervals do slightly overlap, there is not enough evidence to say that algorithms are different, and the new Algo 2 is not necessarily more efficient.\nWe will get a slightly more precise estimation of uncertainty if we calculate confidence interval for the difference of the proportions. Since \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\) both follow Normal distribution, their difference is also normally distributed \\[\np_1 - p_2 \\sim N(\\hat p_1 - \\hat p_2, s_1^2/n + s_2^2/n).\n\\] Applying this formula for the Google search algorithm experiment, we calculate the 95% confidence interval for the difference\n\ndiff = p1 - p2  + c(-1.96,1.96)*sqrt(p1*(1-p1)/2500 + p2*(1-p2)/2500)\nprint(diff, digits = 5)\n\n## [1] -0.0541696 -0.0042304\n\n\nThe confidence interval for the difference does not contain 0, and thus we can say that we are confident that algorithms are different!\nMore generally, if the number of observations in two groups are different, say \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) then the \\[\ns_{ \\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2 } = \\sqrt{ \\frac{ s^2_{ \\bar{X}_1 }}{n_1} + \\frac{ s^2_{ \\bar{X}_2 }}{n_2} }\n\\] or for proportions, we compute \\[\ns_{ \\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2 } = \\sqrt{ \\frac{ \\hat{p}_1 (1- \\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{ \\hat{p}_2 (1- \\hat{p}_2)}{n_2} }.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType I Error: Rejecting a true \\(H_0\\).\nType II Error: Not rejecting a false \\(H_0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement\nCondition\n\n\n\n\n0 is inside the 95% confidence interval\n\\(p\\)-value is greater than 0.05\n\n\n\\(p\\)-value is greater than 0.05\n\\(Z\\)-statistic is less than 1.96\n\n\n\\(Z\\)-statistic is less than 1.96\n0 is inside the 95% confidence interval\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.7 (Coke vs Pepsi) The most famous hypothesis test in history in whether people can decide the difference between Coke and Pepsi. We run a double blind experiment, neither the experimenter or subject know the allocation. Pepsi claimed that more than half of Diet Coke drinkers said they preferred to drink Diet Pepsi. That is our null hypothesis. The data comes from a random sample of \\(100\\) drinkers. We find that \\(56\\) favor Pepsi.\nThis is a hypothesis test about the proportion of drinkers who prefer Pepsi \\[H_0 : p = \\frac{1}{2} \\; \\; \\mathrm{ and} \\; \\; H_1 : p &gt; \\frac{1}{2}\\] Let’s estimate our statistics form data: \\[\\hat{p} = X/n = 56/100 = 0.56\\]\nThis is my best estimate of the true \\(p\\). The standard error of my statistic \\[se(\\hat{p}) =  \\sqrt{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})/n} = 0.0496 .\\]\nThe \\(95\\)% is then \\[0.56 \\pm 1.96 (0.0496) = 0.56 \\pm 0.098 = ( 0.463, 0.657 )\\] \\(p=0.5\\) lies inside the confidence interval. Pepsi was lying!\nThe \\(Z\\)-score now with \\(s_{ \\hat{p} }= \\sqrt{ p_0(1-p_0)/n} = 0.05\\) \\[Z = \\frac{ \\hat{p} - p_0 }{ s_{\\hat{p} }} = \\frac{ 0.56-0.5}{0.05} = 1.2 &lt; 1.64\\] Let’s take the usual \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). Don’t reject \\(H_0\\) for a one-sided test at \\(5\\)% level. We need a larger \\(n\\) to come to a more definitive conclusion. We might come to a different conclusion with a larger sample size. One of the downsides of hypothesis testing is that it generates a yes/no answer without having any uncertainty associated with it.\n\nprop.test(56,100,alternative='greater', conf.level = 0.95)\n\n## \n##  1-sample proportions test with continuity correction\n## \n## data:  56 out of 100, null probability 0.5\n## X-squared = 1, df = 1, p-value = 0.1\n## alternative hypothesis: true p is greater than 0.5\n## 95 percent confidence interval:\n##  0.47 1.00\n## sample estimates:\n##    p \n## 0.56\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.8 (Avonex) Now we consider a few more examples of Hypothesis testing. We consider the dispute about Biogen’s Avonex. Biogen made the following assertion:\n“Avonex delivers the highest rate of satisfaction: 95% among patients” In response to that statement, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on October 30th, 2002 informed the biotech company Biogen to stop publishing misleading promotions for its multiple sclerosis drug Avonex. To clarify the issue, FDA did run an experiment. The FDA found that in a random sample of \\(75\\) patients surveyed, only 60% said they were satisfied with Avonex. The question is: Who is right?\nLet’s use hypothesis testing to get an answer. Following our five-step process to set up a Hypothesis Test:\n\nFormulate the Null Hypothesis: \\(H_0 : p = 0.95 = p_0\\). The alternative hypothesis: \\(H_1 : p &lt; 0.95\\). A 1-sided alternative.\nWe’ll use a small significance level, 1%.\nThe appropriate test statistic is \\[Z = \\frac{ \\hat{p} - p_0 }{ \\sqrt{ \\frac{ p_0 ( 1 - p_0 ) }{ n} } }\\] where \\(\\hat{p} = 0.60 , p_0 = 0.95\\) and \\(n=75\\).\nCompute the Test Statistic and make a decision \\(Z = \\frac{ 0.6 - 0.95 }{ \\sqrt{ \\frac{ 0.95 \\times 0.05  }{ 75} } } = - 14\\).\n\nTo complete our analysis, we need to determine the critical region and calculate the \\(p\\)-value for this test. For a one-sided test at the 1% significance level, the critical region is \\(Z &lt; -2.32\\). Since our observed test statistic of \\(Z = -14\\) falls well within this rejection region, we reject the null hypothesis.\nThe \\(p\\)-value of the test is \\(P(Z &lt; -14) = 0.0000\\), which is essentially zero. This extremely small \\(p\\)-value provides overwhelming statistical evidence that the FDA is correct and Biogen’s claim is false.\nThis procedure can is implemented in R in the prop.test function.\n\nprop.test(45,75,0.95)\n\n## \n##  1-sample proportions test with continuity correction\n## \n## data:  45 out of 75, null probability 0.95\n## X-squared = 186, df = 1, p-value &lt;2e-16\n## alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.95\n## 95 percent confidence interval:\n##  0.48 0.71\n## sample estimates:\n##   p \n## 0.6\n\n\nThe p-value is less than \\(2.2 \\times 10^{-16}\\), which is essentially zero. This extremely small \\(p\\)-value provides overwhelming statistical evidence that the FDA is correct and Biogen’s claim is false.\n\n\nExample 5.9 (Pfizer) We consider another example that involves pharmaceutical company Pfizer. Pfizer introduced Viagra in early 1998. During \\(1998\\) of the \\(6\\) million Viagra users \\(77\\) died from coronary problems such as heart attacks. Pfizer claimed that this rate is no more than the general population.A clinical study found \\(11\\) out of \\(1,500,000\\) men who were not on Viagra died of coronary problems during the same length of time as the\\(77\\) Viagra users who died in \\(1998\\).The question is,Let’s calculate the significance Interval. A 95% confidence interval fora difference in proportions \\(p_1 - p_2\\) is \\[\n( \\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2 ) \\pm 1.96\n\\sqrt{ \\frac{ \\hat{p}_1 ( 1 - \\hat{p}_1 ) }{ n_1 }  +\n    \\frac{ \\hat{p}_2 ( 1 - \\hat{p}_2 ) }{ n_2 } }\n\\]\nWe can do a confidence interval or a \\(Z\\)-score test.\nWith Viagra, \\(\\hat{p}_1 = 77/6000000 = 0.00001283\\) and without Viagra \\(\\hat{p}_2 = 11/1500000 = 0.00000733\\).\nWe need to test whether these are equal.\nWith a \\(95\\)% confidence interval for \\(( p_1 - p_2 )\\) you get an interval \\[\n( 0.00000549 , 0.0000055).\n\\]\nSince this confidence interval does not contain zero, we have evidence that the proportion of deaths from coronary problems is significantly higher among Viagra users compared to the general population. Despite the small proportions involved, the measurement is highly accurate due to the large sample sizes in both groups.\nFor hypothesis testing, we would use a one-sided test with a significance level of \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\) to test whether the proportion of deaths is higher in the Viagra group. The difference in proportions can be analyzed as follows:\n\nprop.test(x=c(11,77), n=c(1500000,6000000), alternative='greater',conf.level=.95)\n\n## \n##  2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction\n## \n## data:  c(11, 77) out of c(1500000, 6e+06)\n## X-squared = 3, df = 1, p-value = 0.9\n## alternative hypothesis: greater\n## 95 percent confidence interval:\n##  -1e-05  1e+00\n## sample estimates:\n##  prop 1  prop 2 \n## 7.3e-06 1.3e-05\n\n\nThe p-value for the Null is \\(1-0.948 =0.052\\). This p-value is greater than 0.01, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis.\n\n\nExample 5.10 (Lord Rayleigh’s Argon Discovery) Lord Rayleigh won the Nobel Prize for discovery of Argon. This discovery occurred when he noticed a small discrepancy between two sets of measurements on nitrogen gas that he had extracted from the air and one he had made in the lab.\nFirst, he removed all oxygen from a sample of air. He measured the density of the remaining gas in a fixed volume at constant temperature and pressure.\nSecond, he prepared the same volume of pure nitrogen by the chemical decomposition of nitrous oxide (\\(N_2 O\\)) and nitric oxide \\(NO\\).\nHere’s the results\n\nair = c(2.31017, 2.30986, 2.31010, 2.31001, 2.31024, 2.31010, 2.31028, NA)\ndecomp = c(2.30143, 2.29890, 2.29816, 2.30182, 2.29869, 2.29940, 2.29849, 2.29889)\nd = data.frame(\"Air\"=air,\"Chemical Decomposition\"=decomp)\nknitr::kable(d, booktabs = TRUE,caption = 'Lord Rayleigh Argon Discovery')\n\n\nLord Rayleigh Argon Discovery\n\n\nAir\nChemical.Decomposition\n\n\n\n\n2.3\n2.3\n\n\n2.3\n2.3\n\n\n2.3\n2.3\n\n\n2.3\n2.3\n\n\n2.3\n2.3\n\n\n2.3\n2.3\n\n\n2.3\n2.3\n\n\nNA\n2.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nboxplot(d, col = c(\"red\", \"green\"))\n\n\n\n\nLord Rayleigh’s results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean\nsd\n\n\n\n\nAir\n2.3\n0.00014\n\n\nDecomposition\n2.3\n0.00138\n\n\n\n\nt.test(air,decomp,var.equal=T)\n\n## \n##  Two Sample t-test\n## \n## data:  air and decomp\n## t = 20, df = 13, p-value = 3e-11\n## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n## 95 percent confidence interval:\n##  0.0095 0.0118\n## sample estimates:\n## mean of x mean of y \n##       2.3       2.3\n\n\nThe Z-score is 20.

    "text": "5.2 Multiple Testing\nConsider this simple multiple-testing scenario. If we want to test 1000 hypotheses and we test each hypothesis one-by-one, say the ground truth is that only 10% (100) of those hypotheses are true. Using \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) rule, we assume that out of 900 false hypotheses \\(0.05 \\cdot 900 = 45\\) will show up as positive (false positives). Now we run our one-by-one hypothesis tests and our procedure correctly identified 80 out of 100 true positives and incorrectly identified 45 false positives and 20 false negatives. Now, among 125 hypotheses identified as positives 45 in fact are not! Another way to look at it is to calculate the probability of at least one false positive \\(P(\\mbox{at least one false positive}) = 1 - (1-0.05)^{1000} = 1\\). We are almost guaranteed to see at least one false positive.\n\nplot(1:100,1 - (1-0.05)^{1:100}, type='l', ylab=\"False Positive Rate\", xlab=\"Number of Tests\", col=\"red\", lwd=2)\n\n\n\n\nProbability of At Least 1 False Positive\n\n\n\n\nOne way to deal with the problem is to lower the cut-off to \\(\\alpha/n\\). This approach is called the Bonferroni correction. For the case of 1000 hypotheses we set \\(\\alpha = 0.00005\\). However this conservative approach will lead to many false negatives. The probability of identifying at least one significant result is then \\(1 - (1-0.00005)^{1000} = 0.049\\)\n\nClassification of results for a testing procedure.

We aim to set a cutoff so that FDR \\(&lt; Q\\). The FDR approach allows us to increase the power while maintaining some principled bound on error.\nBenjamini and Hochberg developed a procedure based on FDR to perform multiple testing. Under their procedure, we put individual \\(p\\)-values in order from smallest to largest. Then we choose the largest \\(p_k\\) value that is smaller than \\((k/m)/Q\\) where \\(Q\\) is the false discovery rate you choose. Then all hypotheses with index \\(i&lt;k\\) are significant.

    "text": "6.1 Likelihood Principle\nThe hypothesis testing problem is as follows. Based on a sample of data, \\(y\\), generated from \\(p\\left( y \\mid \\theta\\right)\\) for \\(\\theta\\in\\Theta\\), the goal is to determine if \\(\\theta\\) lies in \\(\\Theta_{0}\\) or in \\(\\Theta_{1}\\), two disjoint subsets of \\(\\Theta\\). In general, the hypothesis testing problem involves an action: accepting or rejecting a hypothesis. The problem is described in terms of a null, \\(H_{0}\\), and alternative hypothesis, \\(H_{1}\\), which are defined as \\[\nH_{0}:\\theta\\in\\Theta_{0}\\;\\;\\mathrm{and}\\;\\;H_{1}%\n:\\theta\\in\\Theta_{1}\\text{.}%\n\\]\nDifferent types of regions generate different types of hypothesis tests. If the null hypothesis assumes that \\(\\Theta_{0}\\) is a single point, \\(\\Theta _{0}=\\theta_{0}\\), this is known as a simple or “sharp” null hypothesis. If the region consists of multiple points, the hypothesis is called composite; this occurs when the space is unconstrained or corresponds to an interval of the real line. In the case of a single parameter, typical one-sided tests are of the form \\(H_{0}:\\theta&lt;\\theta_{0}\\) and \\(H_{1}:\\theta&gt;\\theta_{0}\\).\nThere are two correct decisions and two possible types of errors. The correct decisions are accepting a null or an alternative that is true, whereas a Type I error incorrectly rejects a true null and a Type II error incorrectly accepts a false null.\nFormally, the probabilities of Type I (\\(\\alpha\\)) and Type II (\\(\\beta\\)) errors are defined as: \\[\n\\alpha=P \\left[  \\text{reject }H_{0} \\mid H_{0}\\text{\nis true }\\right]  \\text{ and }\\beta=P \\left[  \\text{accept\n}H_{0} \\mid H_{1}\\text{ is true }\\right]  \\text{.}%\n\\]\nIt is useful to think of the decision to accept or reject as a decision rule, \\(d\\left( y\\right)\\). In many cases, the decision rules form a critical region \\(R\\), such that \\(d\\left( y\\right) =d_{1}\\) if \\(y\\in R\\). These regions often take the form of simple inequalities. Next, defining the decision to accept the null as \\(d\\left( y\\right) =d_{0}\\), and the decision to accept the alternative as \\(d_{1},\\) the error types are \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\alpha_{\\theta}\\left(  d\\right)   &  =P \\left[  d\\left(  y\\right)\n=d_{1} \\mid \\theta\\right]  \\text{ if }\\theta\\in\\Theta_{0}\\text{ }(H_{0}\\text{ is true})\\\\\n\\beta_{\\theta}\\left(  d\\right)   &  =P \\left[  d\\left(  y\\right)\n=d_{0} \\mid \\theta\\right]  \\text{ if }\\theta\\in\\Theta_{1}\\text{ }(H_{1}\\text{ is true})\\text{.}%\n\\end{align*}\\] where both types of errors explicitly depend on the decision and the true parameter value. Notice that both of these quantities are determined by the population properties of the data. In the case of a composite null hypothesis, the size of the test (the probability of making a type I error) is defined as \\[\n\\alpha = \\underset{\\theta\\in\\Theta_{0}}{\\sup}~\\alpha_{\\theta}\\left( d\\right)\n\\] and the power is defined as \\(1-\\beta_{\\theta}\\left( d\\right)\\). It is always possible to set either \\(\\alpha_{\\theta}\\left( d\\right)\\) or \\(\\beta_{\\theta }\\left( d\\right)\\) equal to zero, by finding a test that always rejects the alternative or null, respectively.\nThe total probability of making an error is \\(\\alpha_{\\theta}\\left(d\\right) +\\beta_{\\theta}\\left(d\\right)\\), and ideally one would seek to minimize the total error probability, absent additional information. The optimal action \\(d^*\\) minimizes the posterior expected loss; \\(d^* = d_0 = 0\\) if the posterior probability of hypothesis \\(H_0\\) exceeds 1/2, and \\(d^* = d_1=1\\) otherwise \\[\nd^* = 1\\left(  P \\left(  \\theta \\in \\Theta_0 \\mid y\\right) &lt; P \\left(  \\theta \\in \\Theta_1 \\mid y\\right)\\right)  = 1\\left(P \\left(  \\theta \\in \\Theta_0 \\mid y\\right)&lt;1/2\\right).\n\\] Simply speaking, the hypothesis with higher posterior probability is selected.\nThe easiest way to reduce the error probability is to gather more data, as the additional evidence should lead to more accurate decisions. In some cases, it is easy to characterize optimal tests, those that minimize the sum of the errors. Simple hypothesis tests of the form \\(H_{0}:\\theta=\\theta_{0}\\) versus \\(H_{1}:\\theta=\\theta_{1}\\), are one such case admitting optimal tests. Defining \\(d^{\\ast}\\) as a test accepting \\(H_{0}\\) if \\(a_{0}f\\left( y \\mid \\theta_{0}\\right) &gt;a_{1}f\\left( y \\mid \\theta_{1}\\right)\\) and \\(H_{1}\\) if \\(a_{0}f\\left( y \\mid \\theta_{0}\\right) &lt;a_{1}f\\left( y \\mid \\theta _{1}\\right)\\), for some \\(a_{0}\\) and \\(a_{1}\\). Either \\(H_{0}\\) or \\(H_{1}\\) can be accepted if \\(a_{0}f\\left(y \\mid \\theta_{0}\\right) =a_{1}f\\left( y \\mid \\theta_{1}\\right)\\). Then, for any other test \\(d\\), it is not hard to show that \\[\na_{0}\\alpha\\left(  d^{\\ast}\\right)  +a_{1}\\beta\\left(  d^{\\ast}\\right)  \\leq\na_{0}\\alpha\\left(  d\\right)  +a_{1}\\beta\\left(  d\\right),\n\\] where \\(\\alpha_{d}=\\alpha_{d}\\left( \\theta\\right)\\) and \\(\\beta_{d}=\\beta_{d}\\left( \\theta\\right)\\). This result highlights the optimality of tests defining rejection regions in terms of the likelihood ratio statistic, \\(f\\left( y \\mid \\theta_{0}\\right)/f\\left( y \\mid \\theta_{1}\\right)\\). It turns out that the results are in fact stronger. In terms of decision theoretic properties, tests that define rejection regions based on likelihood ratios are not only admissible decisions, but form a minimal complete class, the strongest property possible.\nA decision rule \\(d\\) is admissible if there is no other decision rule \\(d'\\) that is uniformly better than \\(d\\), meaning \\(R(\\theta, d') \\leq R(\\theta, d)\\) for all \\(\\theta \\in \\Theta\\), with strict inequality for at least one \\(\\theta\\). In the context of hypothesis testing, this means that an admissible test cannot be improved upon simultaneously for both Type I and Type II error rates.\nA class \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) of decision rules is called complete if for every decision rule \\(d\\) not in \\(\\mathcal{C}\\), there exists a rule \\(d' \\in \\mathcal{C}\\) such that \\(d'\\) is better than or equivalent to \\(d\\). A complete class is minimal if no proper subset of it is also complete. The minimal complete class represents the smallest collection of decision rules that contains all the “best” procedures.\nFor simple hypothesis testing problems of the form \\(H_0: \\theta = \\theta_0\\) versus \\(H_1: \\theta = \\theta_1\\), the likelihood ratio tests form a minimal complete class. This remarkable result means that any reasonable test can be expressed as a likelihood ratio test for some choice of critical value. Furthermore, every likelihood ratio test is admissible, providing strong theoretical justification for their use.\nThe practical implication is profound: when facing a simple versus simple hypothesis testing problem, one need only consider tests of the form “reject \\(H_0\\) if \\(\\frac{f(y|\\theta_1)}{f(y|\\theta_0)} &gt; k\\)” for some threshold \\(k \\geq 0\\). Any other test is either equivalent to such a likelihood ratio test or is inadmissible (meaning there exists a likelihood ratio test that performs better).\nOne of the main problems in hypothesis testing is that there is often a tradeoff between the two goals of reducing type I and type II errors: decreasing \\(\\alpha\\) leads to an increase in \\(\\beta\\), and vice-versa. Because of this, it is common to fix \\(\\alpha_{\\theta}\\left( d\\right)\\), or \\(\\sup~\\alpha_{\\theta}\\left( d\\right)\\), and then find a test to minimize \\(\\beta_{d}\\left( \\theta\\right)\\). This leads to “most powerful” tests. There is an important result from decision theory: test procedures that use the same size level of \\(\\alpha\\) in problems with different sample sizes are inadmissible. This is commonly done where significance is indicated by a fixed size, say 5%. The implications of this will be clearer below in examples.\nGiven observed data \\(y\\) and likelihood function \\(l(\\theta) = p(y\\mid \\theta)\\), the likelihood principle states that all relevant experimental information is contained in the likelihood function for the observed \\(y\\). Furthermore, two likelihood functions contain the same information about \\(\\theta\\) if they are proportional to each other. For example, the widely used maximum-likelihood estimation does satisfy the likelihood principle. However, this principle is sometimes violated by non-Bayesian hypothesis testing procedures. The likelihood principle is a fundamental principle in statistical inference, and it is a key reason why Bayesian procedures are often preferred.",

Suppose, \\[\nH_0 :~\\theta=1/2 \\quad\\text{v.s.} \\quad  H_1 :~\\theta&gt;1/2.\n\\] An experiment is conducted and 9 heads and 3 tails are observed. This information is not sufficient to fully specify the model \\(p(y\\mid \\theta)\\). There are two approaches.\nScenario 1: Number of flips, \\(n = 12\\) is predetermined.

It is entirely appropriate to collect data until a point has been proven or disproven, or until the data collector runs out of time, money, or patience.",

    "section": "6.2 The Bayesian Approach",
    "text": "6.2 The Bayesian Approach\nFormally, the Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing is a special case of the model comparison results to be discussed later. The Bayesian approach just computes the posterior distribution of each hypothesis. By Bayes \\[\nP \\left(  H_{i} \\mid y\\right)  =\\frac{p\\left(  y \\mid H_{i}\\right)  P \\left(  H_{i}\\right)  }{p\\left(  y\\right)}    , ~\\text{for} ~ i=0,1\n\\] where \\(P \\left( H_{i}\\right)\\) is the prior probability of \\(H_{i}\\), \\[\np\\left( y \\mid H_{i}\\right) =\\int_{\\theta \\in \\Theta_i} p\\left( y \\mid \\theta\\right) p\\left( \\theta \\mid H_{i}\\right) d\\theta\n\\] is the marginal likelihood under \\(H_{i}\\), \\(p\\left( \\theta \\mid H_{i}\\right)\\) is the parameter prior under \\(H_{i}\\), and \\[\np\\left(  y\\right)  = \\sum_{i=0,1} p\\left(  y \\mid H_{i}\\right)  P \\left( H_{i}\\right).\n\\]\nIf the hypotheses are mutually exclusive, \\(P \\left( H_{0}\\right) =1-P \\left( H_{1}\\right)\\).\nThe posterior odds of the null to the alternative is \\[\n\\text{Odds}_{0,1}=\\frac{P \\left(  H_{0} \\mid y\\right)  }{P %\n\\left(  H_{1} \\mid y\\right)  }=\\frac{p\\left(  y \\mid H_{0}\\right)\n}{p\\left(  y \\mid H_{1}\\right)  }\\frac{P \\left(  H_{0}\\right)  }{P \\left(  H_{1}\\right)  }\\text{.}%\n\\]\nThe odds ratio updates the prior odds, \\(P \\left( H_{0}\\right) /P \\left( H_{1}\\right)\\), using the Bayes Factor, \\[\n\\mathrm{BF}_{0,1}=\\dfrac{p\\left(y \\mid H_{0}\\right)}{p\\left( y \\mid H_{1}\\right)}.\n\\] With exhaustive competing hypotheses, \\(P \\left( H_{0} \\mid y\\right)\\) simplifies to \\[\nP \\left(  H_{0} \\mid y\\right)  =\\left(  1+\\left(  \\mathrm{BF}_{0,1}\\right)  ^{-1}\\frac{\\left(  1-P \\left(  H_{0}\\right)\n\\right)  }{P \\left(  H_{0}\\right)  }\\right)  ^{-1}\\text{,}%\n\\] and with equal prior probability, \\(P\\left( H_{0} \\mid y\\right) =\\left( 1+\\left( \\mathrm{BF}_{0,1}\\right) ^{-1}\\right) ^{-1}\\). Both Bayes factors and posterior probabilities can be used for comparing hypotheses. Jeffreys (1961) advocated using Bayes factors, and provided a scale for measuring the strength of evidence that was given earlier. Bayes factors merely indicate that the null hypothesis is more likely if \\(\\mathrm{BF}_{0,1}&gt;1\\), \\(p\\left( y \\mid H_{0}\\right) &gt;p\\left( y \\mid H_{1}\\right)\\). The Bayesian approach merely compares density ordinates of \\(p\\left( y \\mid H_{0}\\right)\\) and \\(p\\left( y \\mid H_{1}\\right)\\), which mechanically involves plugging in the observed data into the functional form of the marginal likelihood.\nFor a point null, \\(H_{0}:\\theta=\\theta_{0}\\), the parameter prior is \\(p\\left( \\theta \\mid H_{0}\\right) =\\delta_{\\theta_{0}}\\left( \\theta\\right)\\) (a Dirac mass at \\(\\theta_{0}\\)), which implies that \\[\np\\left( y \\mid H_{0}\\right) =\\int p\\left( y \\mid \\theta_{0}\\right) p\\left( \\theta \\mid H_{0}\\right) d\\theta=p\\left( y \\mid \\theta_{0}\\right).\n\\] With a general alternative, \\(H_{1}:\\theta\\neq\\theta_{0}\\), the probability of the null is \\[\nP \\left(  \\theta=\\theta_{0} \\mid y\\right)  =\\frac{p\\left(  y \\mid \\theta\n_{0}\\right)  P \\left(  H_{0}\\right)  }{p\\left(  y \\mid \\theta\n_{0}\\right)  P \\left(  H_{0}\\right)  +\\left(  1-P\\left( H_{0}\\right)  \\right)  \\int_{\\Theta}p\\left(  y \\mid \\theta,H_{1}\\right)  p\\left(  \\theta \\mid H_{1}\\right)  d\\theta},\n\\] where \\(p\\left( \\theta \\mid H_{1}\\right)\\) is the parameter prior under the alternative. This formula will be used below.\nBayes factors and posterior null probabilities measure the relative weight of evidence of the hypotheses. Traditional hypothesis testing involves an additional decision or action: to accept or reject the null hypothesis. For Bayesians, this typically requires some statement of the utility/loss that codifies the benefits/costs of making a correct or incorrect decision. The simplest situation occurs if one assumes a zero loss of making a correct decision. The loss incurred when accepting the null (alternative) when the alternative is true (false) is \\(L\\left( d_{0} \\mid H_{1}\\right)\\) and \\(L\\left( d_{1} \\mid H_{0}\\right)\\), respectively.\nThe Bayesian will accept or reject based on the posterior expected loss. If the expected loss of accepting the null is less than the alternative, the rational decision maker will accept the null. The posterior loss of accepting the null is \\[\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[  \\mathcal{L}\\mid d_{0},y\\right]  =L\\left(  d_{0} \\mid H_{0}\\right)\nP \\left(  H_{0} \\mid y\\right)  +L\\left(  d_{0} \\mid H_{1}\\right)  P \\left(  H_{1} \\mid y\\right)  =L\\left( d_{0} \\mid H_{1}\\right)  P \\left(  H_{1} \\mid y\\right)  ,\n\\] since the loss of making a correct decision, \\(L\\left( d_{0} \\mid H_{0}\\right)\\), is zero. Similarly, \\[\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[  \\mathcal{L} \\mid d_{1},y\\right]  =L\\left(  d_{1} \\mid H_{0}\\right)\nP \\left(  H_{0} \\mid y\\right)  +L\\left(  d_{1} \\mid H_{1}\\right)  P \\left(  H_{1} \\mid y\\right)  =L\\left( d_{1} \\mid H_{0}\\right)  P \\left(  H_{0} \\mid y\\right)  .\n\\] Thus, the null is accepted if \\[\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[  \\mathcal{L} \\mid d_{0},y\\right]  &lt;\\mathbb{E}\\left[  \\mathcal{L} \\mid d_{1},y\\right]\n\\Longleftrightarrow L\\left(  d_{0} \\mid H_{1}\\right)  P \\left( H_{1} \\mid y\\right)  &lt;L\\left(  d_{1} \\mid H_{0}\\right)\nP \\left(  H_{0} \\mid y\\right)  ,\n\\] which further simplifies to \\[\n\\frac{L\\left(  d_{0} \\mid H_{1}\\right)  }{L\\left(  d_{1} \\mid H_{0}\\right)  }&lt;\\frac{P \\left(  H_{0} \\mid y\\right)  }{P \\left(  H_{1} \\mid y\\right)  }.\n\\] In the case of equal losses, this simplifies to accept the null if \\(P \\left( H_{1} \\mid y\\right) &lt;P \\left( H_{0} \\mid y\\right)\\). One advantage of Bayes procedures is that the resulting estimators and decisions are always admissible.\n\nExample 6.2 (Enigma machine: Code-breaking) Consider an alphabet of \\(26\\) letters. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be two codes of length \\(T\\). We will look to see how many letters match (\\(M\\)) and don’t match (\\(N\\)) in these sequences. Even though the codes are describing different sentences, when letters are the same, if the same code is being used then the sequence will have a match. To compute the Bayes factor we need the joint probabilities \\[\nP( x,y\\mid  H_0 ) \\; \\; \\mathrm{ and} \\; \\; P( x,y\\mid  H_1 ),\n\\] where under \\(H_0\\) they are different codes, in which case the joint probability is \\(( 1 / A )^{2T}\\). For \\(H_1\\) we first need to know the chance of the same letter matching. If \\(p_t\\) denotes the frequencies of the use of English letters, then we have this match probability \\(m = \\sum_{i} p_i^2\\) which is about \\(2/26\\). Hence for a particular set of letters \\[\nP( x_i , y_i \\mid H_1 ) = \\frac{m}{A} \\; \\mathrm{ if} \\; x_i =y_i \\; \\; \\mathrm{ and} \\; \\;  P( x_i , y_i \\mid H_1 ) = \\frac{1-m}{A(A-1)} \\; \\mathrm{ if} \\; x_i \\neq y_i.\n\\] Hence the log Bayes factor is \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\ln \\frac{P( x,y\\mid  H_1 )}{P( x,y\\mid  H_0 )} & = M \\ln \\frac{ m/A}{1/A^2} +N \\ln \\frac{ ( 1-m ) / A(A-1) }{ 1/ A^2} \\\\\n& = M \\ln mA  + N \\ln \\frac{ ( 1-m )A }{A-1 }\n\\end{align*}\\] The first term comes when you get a match and the increase in the Bayes factor is large, \\(3.1\\) (on a \\(\\log_{10}\\)-scale), otherwise you get a no-match and the Bayes factor decreases by \\(- 0.18\\).\nExample: \\(N=4\\), \\(M=47\\) out of \\(T=51\\), then gives evidence of 2.5 to 1 in favor of \\(H_1\\).\nHow long a sequence do you need to look at? Calculate the expected log odds. Turing and Good figured you needed sequences of about length \\(400\\). Can also look at doubles and triples.\n\n\nExample 6.3 (Signal Transmission) Suppose that the random variable \\(X\\) is transmitted over a noisy communication channel. Assume that the received signal is given by \\[\nY=X+W,\n\\] where \\(W\\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\) is independent of \\(X\\). Suppose that \\(X=1\\) with probability \\(p\\), and \\(X=-1\\) with probability \\(1-p\\). The goal is to decide between \\(X=1\\) and \\(X=-1\\) by observing the random variable \\(Y\\). We will assume symmetric loss and will accept the hypothesis with the higher posterior probability. This is also sometimes called the maximum a posteriori (MAP) test.\nWe assume that \\(H_0: ~ X = 1\\), thus \\(Y\\mid H_0 \\sim N(1,\\sigma^2)\\), and \\(Y\\mid H_1 \\sim N(-1,\\sigma^2)\\). The Bayes factor is simply the likelihood ratio \\[\n\\dfrac{p(y\\mid H_0)}{p(y \\mid H_1)} =  \\exp\\left( \\frac{2y}{\\sigma^2}\\right).\n\\] The prior odds are \\(p/(1-p)\\), thus the posterior odds are \\[\n\\exp\\left( \\frac{2y}{\\sigma^2}\\right)\\dfrac{p}{1-p}.\n\\] We choose \\(H_0\\) (true \\(X\\) is 1), if the posterior odds are greater than 1, i.e., \\[\ny &gt; \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} \\log\\left( \\frac{1-p}{p}\\right) = c.\n\\]\nFurther, we can calculate the error probabilities of our test. \\[\np(d_1\\mid H_0) = P(Y&lt;c\\mid X=1) = \\Phi\\left( \\frac{c-1}{\\sigma}\\right),\n\\] and \\[\np(d_0\\mid H_1) = P(Y&gt;c\\mid X=-1) = 1- \\Phi\\left( \\frac{c+1}{\\sigma}\\right).\n\\] Let’s plot the total error rate as a function of \\(p\\) and assuming \\(\\sigma=0.2\\) \\[\nP_e = p(d_1\\mid H_0) (1-p) + p(d_0\\mid H_1) p\n\\]\n\nsigma &lt;- 0.2\np &lt;- seq(0.01,0.99,0.01)\nc &lt;- sigma^2/2*log((1-p)/p)\nPe &lt;- pnorm((c-1)/sigma)*(1-p) + (1-pnorm((c+1)/sigma))*p\nplot(p,Pe,type=\"l\",xlab=\"p\",ylab=\"Total Error Rate\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6.4 (Hockey: Hypothesis Testing for Normal Mean) The general manager of Washington Capitals (an NHL hockey team) thinks that their star center player Evgeny Kuznetsov is underperforming and is thinking of trading him to a different team. He uses the number of goals per season as a metric of performance. He knows that historically, a top forward scores on average 30 goals per season with a standard deviation of 5, \\(\\theta \\sim N(30,25)\\). In the 2022-2023 season Kuznetsov scored 12 goals. For the number of goals \\(X\\mid \\theta\\) he uses normal likelihood \\(N(\\theta, 36)\\). Kuznetsov’s performance was not stable over the years, thus the high variance in the likelihood. Thus, the posterior is \\(N(23,15)\\).\n\nsigma2 = 36\nsigma02 = 25\nmu=30\ny=12\nk = sigma02 + sigma2\nmu1 = sigma2/k*mu + sigma02/k*y\nsigma21 = sigma2*sigma02/k\nmu1\n\n 23\n\nsigma21\n\n 15\n\n\nThe manager thinks that Kuznetsov simply had a bad year and his true performance is at least 24 goals per season \\(H_0: \\theta \\geq 24\\), \\(H_1: \\theta&lt;24\\). The posterior probability of the \\(H_0\\) hypothesis is\n\na = 1-pnorm(24,mu1,sqrt(sigma21))\na\n\n 0.36\n\n\nIt is less than 1/2, only 36%. Thus, we should reject the null hypothesis. The posterior odds in favor of the null hypothesis are\n\na/(1-a)\n\n 0.56\n\n\nIf underestimating (and trading) Kuznetsov is two times more costly than overestimating him (fans will be upset and team spirit might be affected), that is \\(L(d_1\\mid H_0) = 2L(d_0\\mid H_1)\\), then we should accept the null when posterior odds are greater than 1/2. This is the case here, 0.55 is greater than 1/2. The posterior odds are in favor of the null hypothesis. Thus, the manager should not trade Kuznetsov.\nKuznetsov was traded to Carolina Hurricanes towards the end of the 2023-2024 season.\nNotice, when we try to evaluate a newcomer to the league, we use the prior probability of \\(\\theta \\geq 24\\):\n\na = 1-pnorm(24,mu,sqrt(sigma02))\nprint(a)\n\n 0.88\n\na/(1-a)\n\n 7.7\n\n\nThus, the prior odds in favor of \\(H_0\\) are 7.7.\n\n\nExample 6.5 (Hypothesis Testing for Normal Mean: Two-Sided Test) In the case of two sided test, we are interested in testing\n\n\\(H_0: \\theta = \\theta_0\\), \\(p\\left( \\theta \\mid H_{0}\\right) =\\delta_{\\theta_0}\\left( \\theta\\right)\\)\n\\(H_1: \\theta \\neq \\theta_0\\), \\(p\\left( \\theta \\mid H_{1}\\right) = N\\left( \\theta_0,\\sigma^{2}/n_0\\right)\\)\n\nWhere \\(n\\) is the sample size and \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the variance (known) of the population. Observed samples are \\(Y = (y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n)\\) with \\[\ny_i \\mid \\theta,\\sigma^2 \\sim N(\\theta, \\sigma^2).\n\\]\nThe Bayes factor can be calculated analytically \\[\nBF_{0,1} = \\frac{p(Y\\mid \\theta = \\theta_0, \\sigma^2 )}\n{\\int p(Y\\mid \\theta, \\sigma^2) p(\\theta \\mid \\theta_0, n_0, \\sigma^2)\\, d \\theta}\n\\] \\[\n\\int p(Y\\mid \\theta, \\sigma^2) p(\\theta \\mid \\theta_0, n_0, \\sigma^2)\\, d \\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{n_0}\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{n_0(\\theta_0-\\bar y)^2}{2\\left(n_0+n\\right)\\sigma^2}\\right\\}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma^2\\sqrt{\\frac{n_0+n}{\\sigma^2}}}\n\\] \\[\np(Y\\mid \\theta = \\theta_0, \\sigma^2 ) = \\frac{\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{(\\bar y-\\theta_0)^2}{2 \\sigma ^2}\\right\\}}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi } \\sigma }\n\\] Thus, the Bayes factor is \\[\nBF_{0,1} = \\frac{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{n_0+n}{\\sigma^2}}e^{-\\frac{(\\theta_0-\\bar y)^2}{2\\left(n_0+n\\right)\\sigma^2}}}{\\sqrt{n_0}}\n\\]\n\\[\nBF_{0,1} =\\left(\\frac{n + n_0}{n_0} \\right)^{1/2} \\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{n }{n + n_0} Z^2 \\right\\}\n\\]\n\\[\nZ =  \\frac{(\\bar{Y} - \\theta_0)}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\nOne way to interpret the scaling factor \\(n_0\\) is to look at the standard effect size \\[\n\\delta = \\frac{\\theta - \\theta_0}{\\sigma}.\n\\] The prior of the standard effect size is \\[\n\\delta \\mid H_1 \\sim N(0, 1/n_0).\n\\] This allows us to think about a standardized effect independent of the units of the problem.\nLet’s consider now example of Argon discovery.\n\nair =    c(2.31017, 2.30986, 2.31010, 2.31001, 2.31024, 2.31010, 2.31028, 2.31028)\ndecomp = c(2.30143, 2.29890, 2.29816, 2.30182, 2.29869, 2.29940, 2.29849, 2.29889)\n\nOur null hypothesis is that the mean of the difference equals to zero.

    "section": "6.3 Interval Estimation: Credible Sets",
    "text": "6.3 Interval Estimation: Credible Sets\nThe interval estimators of model parameters are called credible sets. If we use the posterior measure to assess the credibility, the credible set is a set of parameter values that are consistent with the data and gives us is a natural way to measure the uncertainty of the parameter estimate.\nThose who are familiar with the concept of classical confidence intervals (CI’s) often make an error by stating that the probability that the CI interval \\([L, U ]\\) contains parameter \\(\\theta\\) is \\(1 - \\alpha\\). The right statement seems convoluted, one needs to generate data from such model many times and for each data set to exhibit the CI. Now, the proportion of CI’s covering the unknown parameter is “tends to” \\(1 - \\alpha\\). Bayesian interpretation of a credible set \\(C\\) is natural: The probability of a parameter belonging to the set \\(C\\) is \\(1 - \\alpha\\). A formal definition follows. Assume the set \\(C\\) is a subset of domain of the parameter \\(\\Theta\\). Then, \\(C\\) is credible set with credibility \\((1 - \\alpha)\\cdot 100\\%\\) if \\[\np(\\theta \\in C \\mid y) = \\int_{C}p(\\theta\\mid y)d\\theta \\ge 1 - \\alpha.\n\\] If the posterior is discrete, then the integral becomes sum (counting measure) and \\[\np(\\theta \\in C \\mid y) = \\sum_{\\theta_i\\in C}p(\\theta_i\\mid y) \\ge 1 - \\alpha.\n\\] This is the definition of a \\((1 - \\alpha)100\\%\\) credible set, and of course for a given posterior function such set is not unique.\nFor a given credibility level \\((1 - \\alpha)100\\%\\), the shortest credible set is of interest. To minimize size the sets should correspond to highest posterior probability (density) areas. Thus the acronym HPD.\n\nDefinition 6.1 (Highest Posterior Density (HPD) Credible Set) The \\((1 - \\alpha)100\\%\\) HPD credible set for parameter \\(\\theta\\) is a set \\(C \\subset \\Theta\\) of the form \\[\nC = \\{ \\theta \\in \\Theta : p(\\theta \\mid y) \\ge k(\\alpha) \\},\n\\] where \\(k(\\alpha)\\) is the largest value such that \\[\nP(\\theta\\in C \\mid y) = \\int_{C}p(\\theta\\mid y)d\\theta \\ge 1 - \\alpha.\n\\] Geometrically, if the posterior density is cut by a horizontal line at the height \\(k(\\alpha)\\), the set \\(C\\) is the projection on the \\(\\theta\\) axis of the region where the posterior density lies above the line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLemma 6.1 The HPD set \\(C\\) minimizes the size among all sets \\(D \\subset \\Theta\\) for which \\[\nP(\\theta \\in D) = 1 - \\alpha.\n\\]\n\n\nProof. The proof is essentially a special case of Neyman-Pearson lemma. If \\(I_C(\\theta) = 1(\\theta \\in C)\\) and \\(I_D(\\theta) = 1(\\theta \\in D)\\), then the key observation is \\[\n\\left(p(\\theta\\mid y) - k(\\alpha)\\right)(I_C(\\theta) - I_D(\\theta)) \\ge 0.\n\\] Indeed, for \\(\\theta\\)’s in \\(C\\cap D\\) and \\((C\\cup D)^c\\), the factor \\(I_C(\\theta)-I_D(\\theta) = 0\\). If \\(\\theta \\in C\\cap D^c\\), then \\(I_C(\\theta)-I_D(\\theta) = 1\\) and \\(p(\\theta\\mid y)-k(\\alpha) \\ge 0\\). If, on the other hand, \\(\\theta \\in D\\cap C^c\\), then \\(I_C(\\theta)-I_D(\\theta) = -1\\) and \\(p(\\theta\\mid y)-k(\\alpha) \\le 0\\). Thus, \\[\n\\int_{\\Theta}(p(\\theta\\mid y) - k(\\alpha))(I_C(\\theta) - I_D(\\theta))d\\theta \\ge 0.\n\\] The statement of the theorem now follows from the chain of inequalities, \\[\n\\int_{C}(p(\\theta\\mid y) - k(\\alpha))d\\theta \\ge \\int_{D}(p(\\theta\\mid y) - k(\\alpha))d\\theta\n\\] \\[\n(1-\\alpha) - k(\\alpha)\\text{size}(C) \\ge (1-\\alpha) - k(\\alpha)\\text{size}(D)\n\\] \\[\nsize(C) \\le size(D).\n\\] The size of a set is simply its total length if the parameter space \\(\\theta\\) is one dimensional, total area, if \\(\\theta\\) is two dimensional, and so on.\n\nNote, when the distribution \\(p(\\theta \\mid y)\\) is unimodal and symmetric using quantiles of the posterior distribution is a good way to obtain the HPD set.\nAn equal-tailed interval (also called a central interval) of confidence level\n\\[\nI_{\\alpha} = [q_{\\alpha/2}, q_{1-\\alpha/2}],\n\\] here \\(q\\)’s are the quantiles of the posterior distribution. This is an interval on whose both right and left side lies \\((1-\\alpha/2)100\\%\\) of the probability mass of the posterior distribution; hence the name equal-tailed interval.\nUsually, when a credible interval is mentioned without specifying which type of the credible interval it is, an equal-tailed interval is meant.\nHowever, unless the posterior distribution is unimodal and symmetric, there are point outsed of the equal-tailed credible interval having a higher posterior density than some points of the interval. If we want to choose the credible interval so that this not happen, we can do it by using the highest posterior density criterion for choosing it.\n\nExample 6.7 (Cauchy.) Assume that the observed samples\n\ny = c(2,-7,4,-6)\n\ncome from Cauchy distribution. The likelihood is \\[\np(y\\mid \\theta, \\gamma) = \\frac{1}{\\pi\\gamma} \\prod_{i=1}^{4} \\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\dfrac{y_i-\\theta}{\\gamma}\\right)^2}.\n\\] We assume unknown location parameter \\(\\theta\\) and scale parameter \\(\\gamma=1\\). For the flat prior \\(\\pi(\\theta) = 1\\), the posterior is proportional to the likelihood.\n\nlhood = function(theta) 1/prod(1+(y-theta)^2)\ntheta &lt;- seq(-10,10,0.1)\npost &lt;- sapply(theta,lhood)\npost = 10*post/sum(post)\nplot(theta,post,type=\"l\",xlab=expression(theta),ylab=\"Posterior Density\")\nabline(h=c(0.008475, 0.0159, 0.1, 0.2),col=\"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe four horizontal lines correspond to four credible sets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(k\\)\n\\(C\\)\n\\(P(\\theta \\in C \\mid y)\\)\n\n\n\n\n0.008475\n[-8.498, 5.077]\n99%\n\n\n0.0159\n[-8.189, -3.022] \\(\\cup\\) [-0.615, 4.755]\n95%\n\n\n0.1\n[-7.328, -5.124] \\(\\cup\\) [1.591, 3.120]\n64.2%\n\n\n0.2\n[-6.893, -5.667]\n31.2%\n\n\n\nNotice that for \\(k = 0.0159\\) and \\(k = 0.1\\) the credible set is not a compact. This shows that two separate intervals “clash” for the ownership of \\(\\theta\\) and this is a useful information. This non-compactness can also point out that the prior is not agreeing with the data. There is no frequentist counterpart for the CI for \\(\\theta\\) in the above model.",

    "section": "6.4 Alternative Approaches",
    "text": "6.4 Alternative Approaches\nThe two main alternatives to the Bayesian approach are significance testing using \\(p-\\)values, developed by Ronald Fisher, and the Neyman-Pearson approach.\n\nSignificance testing using p-values\nFisher’s approach posits a test statistic, \\(T\\left( y\\right)\\), based on the observed data. In Fisher’s mind, if the value of the statistic was highly unlikely to have occured under \\(H_{0}\\), then the \\(H_{0}\\) should be rejected. Formally, the \\(p-\\)value is defined as \\[\np=P \\left[  T\\left(  Y\\right)  &gt;T\\left(  y\\right)   \\mid H_{0}\\right]  ,\n\\] where \\(y\\) is the observed sample and \\(Y=\\left( Y_{1}, \\ldots ,Y_{T}\\right)\\) is a random sample generated from model \\(p\\left( Y \\mid H_{0}\\right)\\), that is, the null distribution of the test-statistic in repeated samples. Thus, the \\(p-\\)value is the probability that a data set would generate a more extreme statistic under the null hypothesis, and not the probability of the null, conditional on the data.\nThe testing procedure is simple. Fisher (1946, p. 80) argues that: If P (the p-value) is between* \\(0.1\\) and \\(0.9\\), there is certainly no reason to suspect the hypothesis tested. If it is below \\(0.02\\), it is strongly indicated that the hypothesis fails to account for the whole of the facts. We shall not be astray if we draw a line at 0.05 and consider that higher values of \\(\\mathcal{X}^{2}\\) indicate a real discrepancy. Defining \\(\\alpha\\) as the significance level, the tests rejects \\(H_{0}\\) if \\(p&lt;\\alpha\\). Fisher advocated a fixed significance level of \\(5\\%\\), based largely that \\(5\\%\\) is roughly the tail area of a mean zero normal distribution more than two standard deviations from \\(0\\), indicating a statistically significant departure. In practice, testing with \\(p-\\)values involves identifying a critical value, \\(t_{\\alpha}\\), and rejecting the null if the observed statistic \\(t\\left( y\\right)\\) is more extreme than \\(t_{\\alpha}\\). For example, for a significance test of the sample mean, \\(t\\left( y\\right) =\\left( \\overline{y}-\\theta_{0}\\right) /se\\left( \\overline{y}\\right)\\), where \\(se\\left( \\overline{y}\\right)\\) is the standard error of \\(\\overline{y}\\); the \\(5\\%\\) critical value is 1.96; and Fisher would reject the null if \\(t\\left( y\\right) &gt;t_{\\alpha}\\).\nFisher interpreted the \\(p-value\\) as the weight or measure of evidence of the null hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis is noticeable in its absence in Fisher’s approach. Fisher largely rejected the consideration of alternatives, believing that researchers should weigh the evidence or draw conclusions about the observed data rather than making decisions such as accepting or rejecting hypotheses based on it.\nThere are a number of issues with Fisher’s approach. The first and most obvious criticism is that it is possible to reject the null, when the alternative hypothesis is less likely. This is an inherent problem in using population tail probabilities–essentially rare events. Just because a rare event has occurred does not mean the null is incorrect, unless there is a more likely alternative. This situation often arises in court cases, where a rare event like a murder has occurred. Decisions based on p-values generates a problem called prosecutor’s Fallacy, which is discussed below. Second, Fisher’s approach relies on population properties (the distribution of the statistic under the null) that would only be revealed in repeated samples or asymptotically. Thus, the testing procedure relies on data that is not yet seen, a violation of what is known as the likelihood principle. As noted by Jeffreys’ (1939, pp. 315-316): “What the use of P implies, therefore, is that a hypothesis that may be true may be rejected because it has not predicted observable data that have not occurred. This seems a remarkable procedure” \nThird, Fisher is agnostic regarding the source of the test statistics, providing no discussion of how the researcher decides to focus on one test statistic over another. In some simple models, the distribution of properly scaled sufficient statistics provides natural test statistics (e.g., the \\(t-\\)test). In more complicated models, Fisher is silent on the sources. In many cases, there are numerous test statistics (e.g., testing for normality), and test choice is clearly subjective. For example, in GMM tests, the choice of test moments is clearly a subjective choice. Finally, from a practical perspective, \\(p-\\)values have a serious deficiency: tests using \\(p\\)-values often appear to give the wrong answer, in the sense that they provide a highly misleading impression of the weight of evidence in many samples. A number of examples of this will be given below, but in all cases, Fisher’s approach tends to over-reject the null hypotheses.\n\n\nNeyman-Pearson\nThe motivation for the Neyman-Pearson (NP) approach was W.S. Gosset, the famous `Student’ who invented the \\(t-\\)test. In analyzing a hypothesis, Student argued that a hypothesis is not rejected unless an alternative is available that provides a more plausible explanation of the data, in which case. Mathematically, this suggests analyzing the likelihood ratio, \\[\n\\mathcal{LR}_{0,1}=\\frac{p\\left(  y \\mid H_{0}\\right)  }{p\\left( y \\mid H_{1}\\right)  }\\text{,}%\n\\] and rejecting the null in favor of the alternative when the likelihood ratio is small enough, \\(\\mathcal{LR}_{0,1}&lt;k\\). This procedures conforms in spirit with the Bayesian approach.\nThe main problem was one of finding a value of the cut off parameter \\(k.\\) From the discussion above, by varying \\(k\\), one varies the probabilities of type one and type two errors in the testing procedure. Originally, NP argued this tradeoff should be subjectively specified: “how the balance (between the type I and II errors) should be struck must be left to the investigator” (Neyman and Pearson (1933a, p. 296) and “we attempt to adjust the balance between the risks \\(P_{1}\\)\\(P_{2}\\) to meet the type of problem before us” (1933b, p. 497). This approach, however, was not “objective *, and they then advocated fixing \\(\\alpha\\), the probability of a type I error, in order to determine \\(k\\). This led to their famous lemma:\n\nLemma 6.2 (Neyman-Pearson Lemma) Consider the simple hypothesis test of \\(H_{0}:\\theta=\\theta_{0}\\) versus \\(H_{1}:\\theta =\\theta_{1}\\) and suppose that the null is rejected if \\(\\mathcal{LR}_{0,1}&lt;k_{\\alpha}\\), where \\(k_{\\alpha}\\) is chosen to fix the probability of a type I error at \\(\\alpha:\\)% \\[\n\\alpha=P \\left[  y:\\mathcal{LR}_{0,1}&lt;k_{\\alpha} \\mid H_{0}\\right]  \\text{.}%\n\\] Then, this test is the most powerful test of size \\(\\alpha\\) in the sense that any other test with greater power, must have a higher size.\n\nIn the case of composite hypothesis tests, parameter estimation is required under the alternative, which can be done via maximum likelihood, leading to the likelihood ratio \\[\n\\mathcal{LR}_{0,1}=\\frac{p\\left(  y \\mid H_{0}\\right)  }{\\underset\n{\\theta\\in\\Theta}{\\sup}p\\left(  y \\mid \\Theta\\right)  }=\\frac{p\\left( y \\mid H_{0}\\right)  }{p\\left(  y \\mid \\widehat{\\theta}\\right)  }\\text{,}%\n\\] where \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) is the MLE. Because of this, \\(0\\leq\\mathcal{LR}_{0,1}\\leq 1\\) for composite hypotheses. In multi-parameter cases, finding the distribution of the likelihood ratio is more difficult, requiring asymptotic approximations to calibrate \\(k_{\\alpha}.\\)\nAt first glance, the NP approach appears similar to the Bayesian approach, as it takes into account the likelihood ratio. However, like the \\(p-\\)value, the NP approach has a critical flaw. Neyman and Pearson fix the Type I error, and then minimizes the type II error. In many practical cases, \\(\\alpha\\) is set at \\(5\\%\\) and the resulting \\(\\beta\\) is often very small, close to 0. Why is this a reasonable procedure? Given the previous discussion, this is essentially a very strong prior over the relative benefits/costs of different types of errors. While these assumptions may be warranted in certain settings, it is difficult to a priori understand why this procedure would generically make sense. The next section highlights how the \\(p-\\)value and NP approaches can generate counterintuitive and even absurd results in standard settings.",

For this simple test, the likelihood ratio is given by \\[\n\\mathcal{LR}_{0,1}=\\frac{\\exp\\left(  -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^{2}}%\n%TCIMACRO{\\tsum \\nolimits_{t=1}^{T}}%\n%BeginExpansion\n{\\textstyle\\sum\\nolimits_{t=1}^{T}}\n%EndExpansion\n\\left(  y_{t}-\\mu_{0}\\right)  ^{2}\\right)  }{\\exp\\left(  -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma\n^{2}}%\n%TCIMACRO{\\tsum \\nolimits_{t=1}^{T}}%\n%BeginExpansion\n{\\textstyle\\sum\\nolimits_{t=1}^{T}}\n%EndExpansion\n\\left(  y_{t}-\\mu_{1}\\right)  ^{2}\\right)  }=\\exp\\left(  -\\frac{T}{\\sigma^{2}%\n}\\left(  \\mu_{1}-\\mu_{0}\\right)  \\left(  \\overline{y}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\mu_{0}+\\mu_{1}\\right)  \\right)  \\right)  \\text{.}%\n\\] Since \\(\\mathrm{BF}_{0,1}=\\mathcal{LR}_{0,1}\\), assuming equal prior probabilities and symmetric losses, the Bayesian accepts \\(H_{0}\\) if \\(\\mathrm{BF}_{0,1}&gt;1\\). Thus, the Bayes procedure rejects \\(H_{0}\\) if \\(\\overline{y}&gt;\\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\mu_{0}+\\mu_{1}\\right)\\) for any \\(T\\) and \\(\\sigma^{2}\\), with \\(\\mu_{0}\\),\\(\\mu_{1}\\), \\(T,\\)and \\(\\sigma^{2}\\) determining the strength of the rejction. If \\(\\mathrm{BF}_{0,1}=1\\), there is equal evidence for the two hypotheses.\nwedewk dejewoi m\nThe NP procedure proceeds by first setting \\(\\alpha=0.05,\\) and rejects when \\(\\mathcal{LR}_{0,1}\\) is large. This is equivalent to rejecting when \\(\\overline{y}\\) is large, generating an `optimal’ rejection region of the form \\(\\overline{y}&gt;c\\). The cutoff value \\(c\\) is calibrated via the size of the test, \\[\nP \\left[  reject\\text{ }H_{0} \\mid H_{0}\\right]\n=P \\left[  \\overline{y}&gt;c \\mid \\mu_{0}\\right]  =P \\left[\n\\frac{\\left(  \\overline{y}-\\mu_{0}\\right)  }{\\sigma/\\sqrt{T}}&gt;\\frac{\\left( c-\\mu_{0}\\right)  }{\\sigma/\\sqrt{T}} \\mid H_{0}\\right] .\n\\] The size equals \\(\\alpha\\) if \\(\\sqrt{T}\\left( c-\\mu_{0}\\right) /\\sigma =z_{\\alpha}\\). Thus, the NP test rejects if then if \\(\\overline{y}&gt;\\mu _{0}+\\sigma z_{\\alpha}/\\sqrt{T}\\). Notice that the test rejects regardless of the value of \\(\\mu_{1}\\), which is rather odd, since \\(\\mu_{1}\\) does not enter into the size of the test only the power. The probability of a type II error is \\[\n\\beta=P \\left[  \\text{accept }H_{0} \\mid H_{1}\\right]\n=P \\left[  \\overline{y}\\leq\\mu_{0}+\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{T}}z_{\\alpha\n} \\mid H_{1}\\right]  =\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\mu_{0}+\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{T}%\n}z_{\\alpha}}p\\left(  \\overline{y} \\mid \\mu_{1}\\right)  d\\overline{y}\\text{,}%\n\\] where \\(p\\left( \\overline{y} \\mid \\mu_{1}\\right) \\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left( \\mu _{1},\\sigma^{2}/T\\right)\\).\nThese tests can generate strikingly different conclusions. Consider a test of \\(H_{0}:\\mu=0\\) versus \\(H_{1}:\\mu=5\\), based on \\(T=100\\) observations drawn from \\(y_{t}\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left( \\mu,10^{2}\\right)\\) with \\(\\overline{y}=2\\). For NP, since \\(\\sigma/\\sqrt{T}=1\\), \\(\\overline{y}\\) is two standard errors away from \\(0\\), thus \\(H_{0}\\) is rejected at the 5% level (the same conclusion holds for \\(p-\\)values). Since \\(p(\\overline {y}=2 \\mid H_{0})=0.054\\) and \\(p(\\overline{y}=2 \\mid H_{1})=0.0044\\), the Bayes factor is \\(\\mathrm{BF}_{0,1}=12.18\\) and \\(P \\left( H_{0} \\mid y\\right) =92.41\\%\\). Thus, the Bayesian is quite sure the null is true, while Neyman-Pearson reject the null.\nThe paradox can be seen in two different ways. First, although \\(\\overline{y}\\) is actually closer to \\(\\mu_{0}\\) than \\(\\mu_{1}\\), the NP test rejects \\(H_{0}\\). This is counterintuitive and makes little sense. The problem is one of calibration. The classical approach develops a test such that 5% of the time, a correct null would be rejected. The power of the test is easy to compute and implies that \\(\\beta=0.0012\\). Thus, this testing procedure will virtually never accept the null if the alternative is correct. For Bayesian procedure, assuming the prior odds is \\(1\\) and \\(L_{0}=L_{1}\\), then \\(\\alpha=\\beta=0.0062\\). Notice that the overall probability of making an error is 1.24% in the Bayesian procedure compared to 5.12% in the classical procedure. It should seem clear that the Bayesian approach is more reasonably, absent a specific motivation for inflating \\(\\alpha\\). Second, suppose the null and alternative were reversed, testing \\(H_{0}:\\mu=\\mu_{1}\\) versus \\(H_{1}:\\mu=\\mu_{0}\\) In the previous example, the Bayes approach gives the same answer, while NP once again rejects the null hypothesis! Again, this result is counterintuitive and nonsensical, but is common when arbitrarily fixing \\(\\alpha\\), which essentially hardwires the test to over-reject the null.\n\n\nExample 6.9 (Lindley’s paradox) Consider the case of testing whether or not a coin is fair, based on observed coin flips, \\[\nH_{0}:\\theta=\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ versus }H_{1}:\\theta\n\\neq\\frac{1}{2}\\text{,}%\n\\] based on \\(T\\) observations from \\(y_{t}\\sim Ber\\left( \\theta\\right)\\). As an example, Table 6.1 provides 4 datasets of differing lengths. Prior to considering the formal hypothesis tests, form your own opinion on the strength of evidence regarding the hypothesis in each data set. It is common for individuals, when confronted with this data to conclude that the fourth sample provides the strongest of evidence for the null and the first sample the weakest.\n\n\n\nTable 6.1: Lindley’s paradox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#1\n#2\n#3\n#4\n\n\n\n\n# Flips\n50\n100\n400\n10,000\n\n\n# Heads\n32\n60\n220\n5098\n\n\nPercentage of heads\n64\n60\n55\n50.98\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFisher’s solution to the problem posits an unbiased estimator, the sample mean, and computes the \\(t-\\)statistic, which is calculated under \\(H_{0}\\): \\[\nt\\left(  y\\right)  =\\frac{\\overline{y}-E\\left[  \\overline{y} \\mid \\theta\n_{0}\\right]  }{se\\left(  \\overline{y}\\right)  }=\\sqrt{T}\\left(  2\\widehat\n{\\theta}-1\\right)  \\text{,}%\n\\] where \\(se\\left(\\overline{y}\\right)\\) is the standard error of \\(\\overline{y}\\). The Bayesian solution requires marginal likelihood under the null and alternative, which are \\[\np\\left(  y \\mid \\theta_{0}=1/2\\right)  =\\prod_{t=1}^{T}p\\left(  y_{t} \\mid \\theta\n_{0}\\right)  =\\left(  \\frac{1}{2}\\right)  ^{\\sum_{t=1}^{T}y_{t}}\\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\right)  ^{T-\\sum_{t=1}^{T}y_{t}}=\\left(  \\frac{1}{2}\\right)  ^{T},\n\\tag{6.1}\\] and, from Equation 6.1, \\(p\\left( y \\mid H_{1}\\right) =B\\left( \\alpha_{T},\\beta_{T}\\right) /B\\left(\\alpha,\\beta\\right)\\) assuming a beta prior distribution.\nTo compare the results, note first that in the datasets given above, \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) and \\(T\\) generate \\(t_{\\alpha}=1.96\\) in each case. Thus, for a significance level of \\(\\alpha=5\\%\\), the null is rejected for each sample size. Assuming a flat prior distribution, the Bayes factors are \\[\n\\mathrm{BF}_{0,1}=\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}\n[c]{l}%\n0.8178\\text{ for }N=50\\text{ }\\\\\n1.0952\\text{ for }N=100\\\\\n2.1673\\text{ for }N=400\\\\\n11.689\\text{ for }N=10000\n\\end{array}\n\\right.  ,\n\\] showing increasingly strong evidence in favor of \\(H_{0}\\). Assuming equal prior weight for the hypotheses, the posterior probabilities are 0.45, 0.523, 0.684, and 0.921, respectively. For the smallest samples, the Bayes factor implies roughly equal odds of the null and alternative. As the sample size increase, the weight of evidence favors the null, with a 92% probability for \\(N=10K\\).\nNext, consider testing \\(H_{0}:\\theta_{0}=0\\) vs. \\(H_{1}:\\theta_{0}\\neq0,\\) based on \\(T\\) observations from \\(y_{t}\\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left( \\theta_{0},\\sigma^{2}\\right)\\), where \\(\\sigma^{2}\\) is known. This is the formal example used by Lindley to generate his paradox. Using \\(p-\\)values, the hypothesis is rejected if the \\(t-\\)statistic is greater than \\(t_{\\alpha}\\). To generate the paradox, consider datasets that are exactly \\(t_{\\alpha}\\) standard errors away from \\(\\overline{y}\\), that is, \\(\\overline {y}^{\\ast}=\\theta_{0}+\\sigma t_{\\alpha}/\\sqrt{n}\\), and a uniform prior over the interval \\(\\left( \\theta_{0}-I/2,\\theta_{0}+I/2\\right)\\). If \\(p_{0}\\) is the probability of the null, then, \\[\\begin{align*}\nP \\left(  \\theta=\\theta_{0} \\mid \\overline{y}^{\\ast}\\right)   &\n=\\frac{\\exp\\left(  -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{T\\left(  \\overline{y}^{\\ast}-\\theta\n_{0}\\right)  ^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}}\\right)  p_{0}}{\\exp\\left(  -\\frac{1}{2}%\n\\frac{T\\left(  \\overline{y}^{\\ast}-\\theta_{0}\\right)  ^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}%\n}\\right)  p_{0}+\\left(  1-p_{0}\\right)  \\int_{\\theta_{0}-I/2}^{\\theta_{0}%\n+I/2}\\exp\\left(  -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{T\\left(  \\overline{y}^{\\ast}-\\theta\\right)\n^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}}\\right)  I^{-1}d\\theta}\\\\\n&  =\\frac{\\exp\\left(  -\\frac{1}{2}t_{\\alpha}^{2}\\right)  p_{0}}{\\exp\\left( -\\frac{1}{2}t_{\\alpha}^{2}\\right)  p_{0}+\\frac{\\left(  1-p_{0}\\right)  }%\n{I}\\int_{\\theta_{0}-I/2}^{\\theta_{0}+I/2}\\exp\\left(  -\\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{\\left(  \\overline{y}^{\\ast}-\\theta\\right)  }{\\sigma/\\sqrt{T}}\\right)^2\n\\right)  d\\theta}\\\\\n&  \\geq\\frac{\\exp\\left(  -\\frac{1}{2}t_{\\alpha}^{2}\\right)  p_{0}}{\\exp\\left( -\\frac{1}{2}t_{\\alpha}^{2}\\right)  p_{0}+\\frac{\\left(  1-p_{0}\\right)  }%\n{I}\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^{2}/T}}\\rightarrow1\\text{ as }T\\rightarrow\\infty\\text{.}%\n\\end{align*}\\] In large samples, the posterior probability of the null approaches 1, whereas Fisher always reject the null. It is important to note that this holds for any \\(t_{\\alpha}\\), thus even if the test were performed at the 1% level or lower, the posterior probability would eventually reject the null.",

    "section": "6.6 Prior Sensitivity",
    "text": "6.6 Prior Sensitivity\nOne potential criticism of the previous examples is the choice of the prior distribution. How do we know that, somehow, the prior is not biased against rejecting the null generating the paradoxes? Under this interpretation, the problem is not with the \\(p-\\)value but rather with the Bayesian procedure. One elegant way of dealing with the criticism is search over priors and prior parameters that minimize the probability of the null hypothesis, thus biasing the Bayesian procedure against accepting the null hypothesis.\nTo see this, consider the case of testing \\(H_{0}:\\mu_{0}=0\\) vs. \\(H_{1}:\\mu_{0}\\neq0\\) with observations drawn from \\(y_{t} \\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left( \\theta_{0},\\sigma^{2}\\right)\\), with \\(\\sigma\\) known. With equal prior null and alternative probability, the probability of the null is \\(p\\left( H_{0} \\mid y\\right) =\\left( 1+\\left( \\mathrm{BF}_{0,1}\\right) ^{-1}\\right) ^{-1}\\). Under the null, \\[\np\\left(  y \\mid H_{0}\\right)  =\\left(  \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^{2}}\\right)\n^{\\frac{T}{2}}\\exp\\left(  -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(  \\frac{\\left(  \\overline\n{y}-\\theta_{0}\\right)  }{\\sigma/\\sqrt{T}}\\right)  ^{2}\\right)  \\text{.}%\n\\] The criticism applies to the priors under the alternative. To analyze the sensitivity, consider four classes of priors under the alternative: (a) the class of normal priors, \\(p\\left( \\theta \\mid H_{1}\\right) \\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left( a,A\\right)\\); (b) the class of all symmetric unimodal prior distributions; (c) the class of all symmetric prior distributions; and (d) the class of all proper prior distributions. These classes provide varying degrees of prior information, allowing a thorough examination of the strength of evidence.\nIn the first case, consider the standard conjugate prior distribution, \\(p\\left( \\mu \\mid H_{1}\\right) \\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left( \\mu_{0},A\\right)\\). Under the alternative, \\[\\begin{align*}\np\\left(  y \\mid H_{1}\\right)   &  =\\int p\\left(  y \\mid \\mu,H_{1}\\right)  p\\left(  \\mu \\mid H_{1}\\right)  d\\mu\\\\\n&  =\\int p\\left(  \\overline{y} \\mid \\mu,H_{1}\\right)  p\\left( \\mu \\mid H_{1}\\right)  d\\mu\\text{,}%\n\\end{align*}\\] using the fact that \\(\\overline{y}\\) is a sufficient statistic. Noting that \\(p\\left( \\overline{y} \\mid \\mu,H_{1}\\right) \\sim N\\left( \\mu ,\\sigma^{2}/T\\right)\\) and \\(p\\left( \\mu \\mid H_{1}\\right) \\sim N\\left( \\mu_{0},A\\right)\\), we can use the “substitute” instead of integrate trick to assert that \\[\n\\overline{y}=\\mu_{0}+\\sqrt{A}\\eta+\\sqrt{\\sigma^{2}/T}\\varepsilon\\text{,}%\n\\] where \\(\\eta\\) and \\(\\varepsilon\\) are standard normal. Then, \\(p\\left( \\overline{y} \\mid H_{1}\\right) \\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left( \\mu_{0},A+\\sigma^{2}/T\\right)\\). Thus, \\[\n\\mathrm{BF}_{0,1}=\\frac{p\\left(  y \\mid H_{0}\\right)  }{p\\left( y \\mid H_{1}\\right)  }=\\frac{p\\left(  \\overline{y} \\mid H_{0}\\right)\n}{p\\left(  \\overline{y} \\mid H_{1}\\right)  }=\\frac{\\left(  \\sigma^{2}/T\\right)\n^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}{\\left(  \\sigma^{2}/T+A\\right)  ^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}\\frac\n{\\exp\\left(  -\\frac{1}{2}t^{2}\\right)  }{\\exp\\left(  -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac\n{z^{2}\\sigma^{2}/T}{A+\\sigma^{2}/T}\\right)  }\\text{.} \\label{BF_normal}%\n\\] To operationalize the test, \\(A\\) must be selected. \\(A\\) is chosen to minimizing the posterior probabilities of the null, with \\(P_{norm}\\left( H_{0} \\mid y\\right)\\) being the resulting lower bound on the posterior probability of the null. For \\(z\\geq1\\), the lower bound on the posterior probability of the null is \\[\nP_{norm}\\left(  H_{0} \\mid y\\right)  =\\left[\n1+\\sqrt{e}\\exp\\left(  -.5t^{2}\\right)  \\right]  ^{-1},\n\\] which is derived in a reference cited in the notes. This choice provides a maximal bias of the Bayesian approach toward rejecting the null. It is important to note that this is not a reasonable prior, as it was intentionally constructed to bias the null toward rejection.\nFor the class of all proper prior distributions, it is also easy to derive the bound. From equation above, minimizing the posterior probability is equivalent to minimizing the Bayes factor, \\[\n\\mathrm{BF}_{0,1}=\\frac{p\\left(  y \\mid H_{0}\\right)  }{p\\left( y \\mid H_{1}\\right)  }\\text{.}%\n\\] Since \\[\np\\left(  y \\mid H_{1}\\right)  =\\int p\\left(  y \\mid \\theta,H_{1}\\right)  p\\left(  \\theta \\mid H_{1}\\right)  d\\theta\\leq p\\left( y \\mid \\widehat{\\theta}_{MLE},H_{1}\\right)  \\text{,}%\n\\] where \\(\\widehat{\\theta}_{MLE}=\\arg\\underset{\\theta\\neq0}{\\max}p\\left( y \\mid \\theta\\right)\\). The maximum likelihood estimator, maximizes the probability of the alternative, and provides a lower bound on the Bayes factor, \\[\n\\underline{\\mathrm{BF}}_{0,1}=\\frac{p\\left(  y \\mid H_{0}\\right)\n}{\\underset{\\theta\\neq0}{\\sup}p\\left(  y \\mid \\theta\\right)  }\\text{.}%\n\\] In this case, the bound is particularly easy to calculate and is given by \\[\nP_{all}\\left(  H_{0} \\mid y\\right)  =\\left( 1+\\exp\\left(  -\\frac{t^{2}}{2}\\right)  \\right)  ^{-1}\\text{.}%\n\\] A reference cited in the notes provides the bounds for the second and third cases, generating \\(P_{s,u}\\left( H_{0} \\mid y\\right)\\) and \\(P_{s}\\left( H_{0} \\mid y\\right)\\), respectively. All of the bounds only depend on the \\(t-\\)statistic and constants.\nTable 6.2 reports the \\(t-\\)statistics and associated \\(p-\\)values, with the remaining columns provide the posterior probability bounds. For the normal prior and choosing the prior parameter \\(A\\) to minimize the probability of the null, the posterior probability of the null is much larger than the \\(p-\\)value, in every case. For the standard case of a \\(t-\\)statistic of 1.96, \\(P\\left( H_{0} \\mid y\\right)\\) is more than six times greater than the \\(p-\\)value. For \\(t=2.576\\), \\(P\\left( H_{0} \\mid y\\right)\\) is almost 13 times greater than the \\(p-\\)value. These probabilities fall slightly for more general priors. For example, for the class of all priors, a t-statistic of 1.96/2.576 generates a lower bound for the posterior probability of 0.128/0.035\\(,\\) more than 2/3 times the \\(p-\\)value.\n\n\n\nTable 6.2: Comparison of strength of evidence against the point null hypothesis.

    "section": "6.7 Model Elaboration and Nested Model Testing",
    "text": "6.7 Model Elaboration and Nested Model Testing\nAn elaborated model in Bayesian statistics refers to a model that extends or generalizes a simpler, baseline (or “underlying”) model by introducing additional parameters or structure. The purpose of elaboration is to capture more complex features of the data, account for possible deviations from the assumptions of the simpler model, or to allow for greater flexibility in modeling.\nFormally, suppose we start with a baseline model \\(f(y \\mid \\theta)\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is a parameter of interest. An elaborated model introduces an additional parameter (or set of parameters) \\(\\lambda\\), resulting in a family of models \\(f(y \\mid \\theta, \\lambda)\\) indexed by \\(\\lambda \\in \\Lambda\\). The original model is recovered as a special case for some fixed value \\(\\lambda_0\\) (i.e., \\(f(y \\mid \\theta) = f(y \\mid \\theta, \\lambda_0)\\)). The set \\(\\Lambda\\) describes the ways in which the model can be elaborated.\nWhen we use elaborated models then we need to compare nested models (where the simpler model is a special case of the more complex one). In Bayesian analysis, inference in an elaborated model involves integrating over the additional parameters, reflecting uncertainty about both the original and the elaborating parameters.\nApplying the usual Bayesian paradigm (disciplined probability accounting) to the elaborated framework, we see that inference about \\(\\theta\\) is determined by \\[\np(\\theta \\mid y) = \\int_\\Lambda p(\\theta \\mid \\lambda, y) p(\\lambda \\mid y) d\\lambda\n\\] where \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np(\\theta \\mid \\lambda, y) &\\propto p(y \\mid \\theta, \\lambda) p(\\theta \\mid \\lambda) \\\\\np(\\lambda \\mid y) &\\propto p(y \\mid \\lambda) p(\\lambda) \\\\\n\\text{where } p(y \\mid \\lambda) &= \\int p(y \\mid \\theta, \\lambda) p(\\theta \\mid \\lambda) d\\theta\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFor consistency with the elaborated and underlying model, we take \\(p(\\theta \\mid \\lambda_0) = p(\\theta)\\). Since \\(\\lambda\\) labels the form of departure from the initial model \\(M_0: \\lambda = \\lambda_0\\), the form of \\(p(\\lambda)\\) should be chosen to reflect this departure.\nA classical example is the exponential power elaboration of the traditional normal family, allowing for robustness. Here \\(\\lambda \\in (0,3)\\) indexes the power and \\(\\lambda_0 = 2\\) is the Normal case.\nThe posterior mean is simply a weighted average with respect to \\(p(\\lambda \\mid y)\\): \\[\n\\E{\\theta \\mid y} = \\int \\E{\\theta \\mid \\lambda, y} p(\\lambda \\mid y) d\\lambda = \\E[\\lambda \\mid y]{\\E{\\theta \\mid \\lambda, y}}\n\\]\n\nThe Dickey-Savage Approach to Nested Models\nThe Dickey-Savage approach provides a principled Bayesian method for testing nested models—situations where a simpler model is a special case of a more complex one. This approach is particularly useful when we want to assess whether the data support the inclusion of additional parameters or structure in our model, or whether the simpler, baseline model suffices.\nIn the context of Bayesian hypothesis testing, the Dickey-Savage method allows us to compute the Bayes factor for comparing a nested (elaborated) model to its simpler counterpart using only the posterior and prior distributions of the parameter(s) that distinguish the two models. This not only streamlines the computation but also clarifies the relationship between the models and the evidence provided by the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bayes Folklore\n\n\n\nBasically, Dickey-Savage support the commonly used approach in Bayes to fint a model as big as an elefant. You fit a model as big as allowed by your computaitonal budget and statistical skills, we call it \\(M\\). The calculations for any other model, e.g. \\(m_0\\) can be calculted under \\(M\\).\n\n\nSuppose you are conducting a hypothesis test comparing two models, \\(M_0\\) and \\(M_1\\). The null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is that the simpler model \\(M_0\\) is true, and the alternative hypothesis \\(H_1\\) is that the more complex model \\(M_1\\) is true.\nLet’s explore how this approach works and why it is both elegant and practical for model comparison in Bayesian analysis.\nSuppose that \\(M_0 \\subset M\\). Let \\((\\theta, \\psi)\\) have matching priors such that \\[\np(\\psi \\mid \\theta = 0, M) = p(\\psi \\mid M_0)\n\\] where \\(\\theta = 0\\) corresponds to \\(M_0\\). That is, \\(p(y \\mid \\theta = 0, \\psi, M) = p(y \\mid \\psi, M_0)\\).\nThen, we can calculate solely under model \\(M\\) the Bayes factor as follows: \\[\nBF = \\frac{p(\\theta = 0 \\mid y, M)}{p(\\theta = 0 \\mid M)} = \\frac{p(y \\mid M_0)}{p(y \\mid M)}\n\\]\nThis is a ratio of posterior ordinates, valid as long as models are nested. By definition of marginals: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np(y \\mid \\theta = 0, M) &= \\int p(y \\mid \\theta = 0, \\psi, M) p(\\psi \\mid \\theta = 0, M) d\\psi \\\\\n&= \\int p(y \\mid \\psi, M_0) p(\\psi \\mid M_0) d\\psi \\\\\n&= p(y \\mid M_0)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis elegant result shows that Bayes factors for nested models can be computed entirely within the larger model framework.",

We get \\[\n\\frac{p(y \\mid H_0)}{p(y \\mid H_1)} \\geq \\frac{p(y \\mid \\theta = \\theta_0)}{p(y \\mid \\theta = \\hat{\\theta})}\n\\]\nTechnically, \\(p(y \\mid H_1) = \\int p(y \\mid \\theta) p(\\theta \\mid H_1) d\\theta \\leq p(y \\mid \\hat{\\theta})\\).\nFor testing, this gives: \\[\n\\frac{p(y \\mid H_0)}{p(y \\mid H_1)} \\geq \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1.96^2}}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0^2}} = 0.146\n\\]\nIn terms of probabilities, with \\(p(H_0) = p(H_1)\\), we have: \\[\np(H_0 \\mid y) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{p(y \\mid H_1)}{p(y \\mid H_0)} \\frac{p(H_1)}{p(H_0)}} \\geq 0.128\n\\]\nHence, there’s still a 12.8% chance that the null is true! That’s very different from the p-value of 5%.\nMoreover, among experiments with p-values of 0.05, at least 28.8% will actually turn out to be true nulls (Sellke, Bayarri, and Berger 2001)! Put another way, the probability of rejecting a true null conditional on the observed \\(p = 0.05\\) is at least 30%. You are throwing away good null hypotheses and claiming you have found effects!",

    "text": "6.10 Cromwell’s Rule\nThe discussion of hypothesis testing throughout this chapter reveals a fundamental tension between the desire for certainty and the reality of uncertainty in statistical inference. This tension is captured by Cromwell’s Rule, a principle that serves as a philosophical foundation for Bayesian hypothesis testing.\nWe can write Bayes rule for updating models as follows: \\[\np(M \\mid D) = \\frac{p(D \\mid M)}{p(D)} p(M)\n\\]\nThus, if \\(p(M) = 0\\), then \\(p(M \\mid D) = 0\\) for all \\(D\\).\nThis mathematical result has profound implications: if you assign zero prior probability to a hypothesis, no amount of evidence can ever change your mind. The posterior probability remains zero regardless of how strongly the data might support that hypothesis.\nThis principle is named after Oliver Cromwell’s famous plea to the Church of Scotland in 1650:\n\nI beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken\n\nCromwell’s appeal for intellectual humility resonates deeply with the Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing. The rule suggests that we should never assign zero probability to hypotheses that could conceivably be true, as doing so makes us unable to learn from any amount of contradictory evidence.\nThe rule emphasizes the importance of careful prior specification. As we saw in the section on prior sensitivity, even when we try to bias our priors against the null hypothesis, the resulting posterior probabilities often remain substantially higher than corresponding p-values. Cromwell’s Rule reminds us that assigning zero probability to any reasonable hypothesis is not just mathematically problematic—it’s epistemologically unsound.\nCromwell’s Rule further aligns with the likelihood principle discussed earlier. Just as the likelihood principle states that all relevant experimental information is contained in the likelihood function, Cromwell’s Rule ensures that we remain open to learning from all possible evidence. By avoiding zero prior probabilities, we maintain the ability to update our beliefs based on observed data.\nThis principle serves as a philosophical foundation that unifies the various approaches to hypothesis testing discussed in this chapter, emphasizing the importance of intellectual humility and the willingness to learn from evidence in statistical inference.\n\n\n\n\nJeffreys, Harold. 1998.

    "section": "",
    "text": "7.1 Limiting Behavior of Averages\nYet another fundamental concept that is useful for probabilistic reasoning is a stochastic process. An instance of a process is a function \\(X\\colon \\Omega \\rightarrow S\\) from an index set \\(\\Omega\\) to a set of possible values \\(S\\), called the state space. The state space of a stochastic process is the set of all possible states that the process can be in. Each state in the state space represents a possible outcome or condition of the system being modeled. The process then is the distribution over the space of functions from \\(\\Omega\\) to \\(S\\). The term process is used because the function \\(X\\) is often thought of as a time-varying quantity, and the index set \\(\\Omega\\) is often interpreted as time. However, the index set can be any set, and the process can be a random function of any other variable. Both the index set and the state space can be discrete or continuous. For example, a discrete time index can represent days or rounds and a continuous time index is a point on a time line. The state space can be discrete (composed of distinct states, like the number of customers in a store) or continuous (such as the price of a stock). The state space can be one-dimensional (only one aspect of the system is modeled) or multi-dimensional (multiple aspects are modeled simultaneously).\nA stochastic process is a family of random variables that describes the evolution through time of some (physical) process. We denote this by \\(X = \\{X(t),~t\\in T\\}\\), with \\(t\\) representing time and \\(X(t) = \\omega\\) is the state of the process at time \\(t\\). We will get a realization (a.k.a. sample path). In the case when time is discrete, the realization is a sequence of observed \\(X = \\Omega = \\{\\omega_1,\\omega_2,\\ldots\\}\\). Common discrete time processes are Markov chains. Brownian motion is a central process in continuous time and state with almost surely continuous but nowhere differentiable paths. Poisson processes are commonly used to account for jumps in the process.\nHere are some widely used stochastic processes:\nIn contexts like agricultural field trials, the domain for analyzing yield is commonly referred to as the collection of plots. This term is broadly suitable for practical field purposes but is mathematically interpreted as the collection of planar Borel subsets across various growing seasons. In a basic clinical trial for a COVID-19 vaccine, like the AstraZeneca trial in 2021, the domain is typically referred to as the group of patients. This implies the inclusion of all eligible patients, regardless of whether they were actually recruited and observed in the trial. In research on speciation or sexual compatibility in fruit flies, the domain is defined as the set of male-female pairs, encompassing all potential pairs with the desired genetic traits. For a competition experiment, such as a chess or tennis tournament, the domain is described as the set of ordered pairs of participants, which includes all possible pairings, not just those who actually competed against each other at events like US Open in 2024.\nIn data analysis, both experimental and observational data can exhibit variability. This variability is often modeled using probability distributions. These distributions can either represent simple processes with independent elements (then we are back to i.i.d case) or more complex stochastic processes that display dependencies, whether they be serial, spatial, or of other types. Essentially, this modeling approach helps in understanding and predicting data behavior under various conditions. The early sections of Davison (2003) work offer an insightful primer on how to develop and apply these stochastic models across various fields. This introduction is particularly useful for grasping the fundamental concepts and practical applications of these models.\nWhen we observe a stochastic process repeatedly, we naturally ask: what happens to averages as we collect more data? This question lies at the heart of statistical inference and forms the theoretical foundation for learning from experience. The answer is provided by the law of large numbers, one of the most fundamental results in probability theory.",

    "text": "The Weak Law of Large Numbers\nThe weak law of large numbers, in its simplest form, states that sample averages converge in probability to the expected value. For independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots\\) with finite mean \\(\\mu = \\E{X_i}\\), the sample average \\(\\bar{X}_n = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\) satisfies:\n\\[\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} P\\left(\\left|\\bar{X}_n - \\mu\\right| &gt; \\epsilon\\right) = 0\n\\]\nfor any \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\). This form of convergence, known as convergence in probability, means that for large enough \\(n\\), the probability that the sample average deviates from the true mean by more than any fixed amount becomes arbitrarily small.\nThe proof of this result, when the variance \\(\\sigma^2 = \\Var{X_i}\\) exists and is finite, follows elegantly from Chebyshev’s inequality. Since \\(\\E{\\bar{X}_n} = \\mu\\) and \\(\\Var{\\bar{X}_n} = \\sigma^2/n\\), we have:\n\\[\nP\\left(\\left|\\bar{X}_n - \\mu\\right| &gt; \\epsilon\\right) \\leq \\frac{\\Var{\\bar{X}_n}}{\\epsilon^2} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n\\epsilon^2} \\to 0\n\\]\nas \\(n \\to \\infty\\). This simple argument reveals why averages become more reliable as sample sizes grow: the variance of the sample mean shrinks at rate \\(1/n\\).\n\n\nKolmogorov’s Strong Law of Large Numbers\nWhile the weak law establishes convergence in probability, a stronger form of convergence is possible. The strong law of large numbers states that sample averages converge almost surely (with probability one) to the expected value. This is a fundamentally stronger statement: it means that for almost every realization of the sequence, the sample average actually approaches the true mean, not merely that the probability of large deviations vanishes.\nAndrey Kolmogorov formalized this result in his groundbreaking 1933 monograph Foundations of the Theory of Probability (Kolmogoroff 1933), establishing the conditions under which strong convergence holds. His result revolutionized probability theory by providing a rigorous measure-theoretic foundation for probabilistic reasoning.\nKolmogorov’s Strong Law states that if \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots\\) are independent random variables with \\(\\E{|X_i|} &lt; \\infty\\), then:\n\\[\n\\bar{X}_n = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \\to \\mu \\quad \\text{almost surely}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\E{X_i}\\), provided this limit exists. For i.i.d. random variables with \\(\\E{|X_1|} &lt; \\infty\\), this simplifies to \\(\\bar{X}_n \\to \\E{X_1}\\) almost surely.\nThe distinction between convergence in probability and almost sure convergence is subtle but crucial. Convergence in probability allows for infinitely many large deviations, as long as they become increasingly rare. Almost sure convergence is stronger: it requires that eventually, after some finite (but random) time, all deviations remain small forever.\nFormally, almost sure convergence means:\n\\[\nP\\left(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\bar{X}_n = \\mu\\right) = 1\n\\]\nThis is equivalent to saying that the set of sequences for which the limit fails to equal \\(\\mu\\) has probability zero. For practical purposes, this means we can be confident that the specific sequence we observe will exhibit convergence—not merely that convergence is likely.\nThe independence assumption is central to Kolmogorov’s results, but it can be relaxed in various ways for different applications. For stochastic processes with dependent observations, the key question becomes: how much dependence can we tolerate while still obtaining convergence of averages?\nFor stationary processes—where the joint distribution of \\((X_t, X_{t+1}, \\ldots, X_{t+k})\\) does not depend on \\(t\\)—a law of large numbers holds under considerably weaker conditions than independence. If the process is ergodic (roughly, if it eventually “forgets” its initial conditions), then time averages converge to ensemble averages:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \\to \\E{X_1} \\quad \\text{almost surely}\n\\]\nThis ergodic theorem extends Kolmogorov’s law of large numbers to dependent sequences and has profound implications for statistical inference from time series data. It justifies the common practice of estimating population means from a single long realization of a stochastic process.\n\n\nImplications for Bayesian Learning\nThe law of large numbers provides theoretical justification for Bayesian learning. As we collect more data, the posterior distribution concentrates around the true parameter value, regardless of the prior. This phenomenon, known as posterior consistency, follows from the fact that the likelihood function—being a product of many terms—is dominated by the data for large samples.\nConsider estimating the mean \\(\\mu\\) of a normal distribution from i.i.d. observations \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) with a prior \\(\\mu \\sim N(\\mu_0, \\tau_0^2)\\). The posterior mean is:\n\\[\n\\E{\\mu \\mid X_1, \\ldots, X_n} = \\frac{\\tau_0^{-2}\\mu_0 + n\\sigma^{-2}\\bar{X}_n}{\\tau_0^{-2} + n\\sigma^{-2}}\n\\]\nAs \\(n \\to \\infty\\), the data term \\(n\\sigma^{-2}\\bar{X}_n\\) dominates, and by the law of large numbers, \\(\\bar{X}_n \\to \\mu\\) almost surely. Thus:\n\\[\n\\E{\\mu \\mid X_1, \\ldots, X_n} \\to \\mu \\quad \\text{almost surely}\n\\]\nThe posterior concentrates at \\(\\mu\\), regardless of the prior \\(\\mu_0\\). The prior matters for small samples but becomes negligible for large samples—a reassuring property that ensures different researchers with different priors eventually reach consensus as evidence accumulates.\n\n\nConnection to Monte Carlo Methods\nThe law of large numbers also underpins Monte Carlo simulation, a cornerstone of modern Bayesian computation. To approximate an expectation \\(\\E{f(X)}\\) where \\(X \\sim p(x)\\), we draw i.i.d. samples \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n \\sim p(x)\\) and compute:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mu}_n = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n f(X_i) \\approx \\E{f(X)}\n\\]\nBy the strong law of large numbers, \\(\\hat{\\mu}_n \\to \\E{f(X)}\\) almost surely as \\(n \\to \\infty\\), provided \\(\\E{|f(X)|} &lt; \\infty\\). The approximation error decreases at rate \\(O_p(n^{-1/2})\\) by the central limit theorem, giving us both convergence guarantees and quantifiable uncertainty.\nThis principle extends to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), where samples are dependent but ergodic. For an ergodic Markov chain with stationary distribution \\(\\pi(x)\\), the ergodic theorem guarantees:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n f(X_i) \\to \\E[\\pi]{f(X)} \\quad \\text{almost surely}\n\\]\nwhere \\(X_i\\) are states visited by the chain. This justifies using MCMC to approximate posterior expectations in Bayesian inference, even though consecutive samples are correlated, see Polson (1996) for a formal analysis.\n\nThe Birth of Monte Carlo: The Manhattan Project\nThe formal development of Monte Carlo methods emerged from the Manhattan Project during World War II, when Stanislaw Ulam, recovering from illness in 1946, realized that complex probability problems could be solved by simulating random processes rather than through analytical calculations. Ulam shared this insight with John von Neumann, who recognized its potential for solving neutron diffusion problems critical to nuclear weapons design and implemented the algorithms on early electronic computers like ENIAC. Nicholas Metropolis coined the term “Monte Carlo” as a reference to the Monaco casino, and the first unclassified paper appeared in 1949 (Metropolis and Ulam 1949). The 1953 Metropolis algorithm (Metropolis et al. 1953) extended the method beyond simple averaging to sampling from complex distributions—precisely the situation in Bayesian inference—laying the groundwork for modern MCMC. The law of large numbers had existed for centuries, but only the combination of electronic computing and wartime urgency transformed this theoretical principle into the practical computational tool that underpins contemporary Bayesian statistics (Metropolis 1987).\n\n\n\nHistorical Context\nThe journey to Kolmogorov’s formalization spans several decades and illustrates the evolution of probability from intuitive reasoning to rigorous mathematics. The weak law of large numbers was first proved by Jakob Bernoulli in 1713 for the special case of binomial random variables—an achievement that took him over twenty years. The result was later generalized by Poisson (1837) and Chebyshev (1867) to broader classes of random variables.\nThe strong law required deeper mathematical machinery. Émile Borel proved a version for Bernoulli trials in 1909, but the general result awaited the development of measure-theoretic probability. Francesco Cantelli made progress in the 1910s, but it was Kolmogorov who provided the definitive treatment in 1933, unifying diverse results under a single rigorous framework.\nKolmogorov’s work transformed probability theory from a collection of special cases and heuristics into a branch of mathematics with the same rigor as analysis or algebra. His measure-theoretic foundations enabled precise statements about almost sure convergence, clarified the distinction between different modes of convergence, and opened the door to modern probability theory and stochastic processes.\n\n\nPractical Significance\nThe law of large numbers is not merely a theoretical curiosity—it forms the bedrock of statistical practice. Every time we estimate a population mean from a sample, test a hypothesis, or train a machine learning model, we implicitly rely on the law of large numbers. The confidence we place in larger samples, the use of cross-validation to assess model performance, and the convergence of stochastic gradient descent in deep learning all trace back to this fundamental result.\nIn the context of stochastic processes, the law of large numbers justifies estimating process parameters from a single long trajectory. When modeling financial returns, climate data, or network traffic, we typically observe one realization over time rather than multiple independent realizations. The ergodic theorem ensures that time averages from this single path converge to the true population moments, enabling inference from the data we actually have.",

    "section": "7.2 The Lévy-Itô Decomposition in Finance",
    "text": "7.2 The Lévy-Itô Decomposition in Finance\nOne of the most profound results in the theory of stochastic processes is the Lévy-Itô decomposition theorem, which provides a universal framework for understanding how randomness evolves over time. The theorem states that any Lévy process (a stochastic process with stationary and independent increments) can be uniquely decomposed into three fundamental components:\n\nA deterministic drift term (linear trend)\nA continuous Gaussian component (Brownian motion)\nA pure jump component (compound Poisson process)\n\nMathematically, any Lévy process \\(X_t\\) can be written as: \\[\nX_t = \\mu t + \\sigma B_t + J_t\n\\] where \\(\\mu\\) is the drift coefficient, \\(B_t\\) is standard Brownian motion with volatility \\(\\sigma\\), and \\(J_t\\) represents the jump component that can be expressed as: \\[\nJ_t = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_t} Z_i\n\\] where \\(N_t\\) is a Poisson process counting the number of jumps up to time \\(t\\), and \\(Z_i\\) are the jump sizes.\nThis decomposition is remarkable because it tells us that no matter how complex a stochastic process might appear, if it has independent and stationary increments, it can always be broken down into these three intuitive building blocks: a predictable trend, continuous random fluctuations, and discrete jumps.\nThe Lévy-Itô decomposition provides a natural motivation for studying Brownian motion and Poisson processes as fundamental objects. Brownian motion captures the continuous, infinitesimal random perturbations that accumulate over time, while the Poisson process models rare, discrete events that cause sudden changes in the system state. Together with a deterministic drift, these components form a complete toolkit for modeling virtually any phenomenon with independent increments.\nThe practical importance of this decomposition cannot be overstated. In finance, asset returns exhibit both continuous price movements (modeled by Brownian motion) and sudden jumps due to news announcements or market shocks (modeled by Poisson processes). In telecommunications, network traffic consists of a steady baseline load (drift) plus continuous fluctuations (Brownian component) and sudden spikes from large file transfers (jumps). In insurance, claim amounts follow a baseline trend with continuous variation and occasional catastrophic events.\n\nExample 7.1 (Financial Asset Prices) Consider modeling the logarithm of a stock price. The Lévy-Itô decomposition suggests we should account for:\n\nDrift: The expected return on the asset, reflecting long-term growth trends in the economy\nBrownian component: Day-to-day price fluctuations driven by the continuous arrival of market information and trading activity\nJump component: Sudden price movements triggered by earnings announcements, regulatory changes, or macroeconomic shocks\n\nFor instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, stock prices exhibited massive downward jumps that could not be explained by a pure Brownian motion model. The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy on September 15, 2008 caused the S&P 500 to drop by 4.7% in a single day—an event that would have probability essentially zero under a Gaussian model but is naturally accommodated by the jump component in the Lévy-Itô framework.\nThe practical application of this decomposition led to the development of jump-diffusion models in quantitative finance, where option prices are calculated by accounting for both continuous price movements and discrete jumps. This approach provides more realistic pricing and risk assessment compared to the classical Black-Scholes model, which assumes only continuous price movements.\nThe Lévy-Itô decomposition thus provides both theoretical insight and practical tools. It explains why Brownian motion and Poisson processes are the fundamental building blocks for continuous-time stochastic modeling, and it gives practitioners a principled framework for decomposing complex random phenomena into interpretable components that can be estimated, simulated, and managed separately.",

    "section": "7.3 Newton and the South Sea Bubble",
    "text": "7.3 Newton and the South Sea Bubble\nThe South Sea Bubble of 1720 stands as one of history’s most spectacular financial disasters, demonstrating that even the greatest scientific minds can fall victim to speculative mania. The South Sea Company, established in 1711 ostensibly to trade with South America, proposed an audacious scheme: it would assume England’s national debt in exchange for company shares and exclusive trading privileges. By early 1720, the company’s directors launched an unprecedented campaign of stock manipulation, spreading rumors of fabulous wealth, bribing politicians and royalty, and offering generous credit terms that allowed investors to purchase shares with only a small down payment. The stock price soared from £128 at the start of 1720 to over £1,000 by June—an eightfold increase in six months (Figure 7.1). Sir Isaac Newton, then Master of the Royal Mint, initially profited by selling his holdings in April 1720 for £7,000, but he could not resist re-entering the market after watching shares continue to climb. When the bubble burst in September, Newton lost £20,000—several years of his salary—leading him to famously remark, “I can calculate the movement of stars, but not the madness of men.” His experience reveals how market psychology and the fear of missing out can overwhelm even the most disciplined rational minds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: South Sea Bubble\n\n\n\nIn the midst of this frenzy, Parliament passed the Bubble Act in June 1720, ironically just as South Sea stock reached its peak. While ostensibly designed to protect investors from fraudulent schemes, the Act was actually lobbied for by South Sea Company directors seeking to eliminate competition from rival ventures attracting investor capital. The Act required all joint-stock companies to obtain expensive royal charters and imposed severe penalties on unauthorized companies, effectively giving the South Sea Company a monopoly on investor enthusiasm. Paradoxically, by forcing the shutdown of smaller speculative ventures and drying up alternative investments, the Act may have hastened the bubble’s collapse by causing investors to question the sustainability of the broader market euphoria. The Act’s unintended consequences proved profound and long-lasting—it severely restricted the development of joint-stock companies in Britain for over a century until its repeal in 1825, arguably impeding industrialization by creating legal obstacles for large-scale ventures requiring significant capital. The episode offers enduring lessons about financial markets: price bubbles exhibit the characteristics of non-stationary stochastic processes with time-varying volatility and jump risk, leverage amplifies both gains and losses, regulatory interventions can create unintended consequences, and even rational agents can behave irrationally when caught in speculative manias—all phenomena that modern stochastic models attempt to capture.\nThe table below shows the prices from five historical bubbles, including the South Sea Bubble.\n\nd &lt;- read.csv(\"../data/sea_bubble.csv\",header=T)\nhead(d)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregorian.Date\nBank.of.England\nRoyal.African.Company\nOld.East.India.Company\nSouth.Sea.Company\nMississippi.Company\n\n\n\n\n21-8-1719\n143\n12\n189\n113\n3400\n\n\n22-8-1719\n143\n12\n188\n113\n3400\n\n\n23-8-1719\n143\n12\n188\n113\n3450\n\n\n24-8-1719\n143\n12\n189\n113\nNA\n\n\n25-8-1719\n144\n12\n189\n114\nNA\n\n\n26-8-1719\n144\n12\n190\n114\n3600\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot of the prices reveals the interconnected nature of early 18th-century financial manias and demonstrates the stochastic features that modern models attempt to capture. The South Sea Bubble exhibits the classic pattern of explosive growth followed by catastrophic collapse—a dramatic jump discontinuity in September 1720 that cannot be explained by continuous Brownian motion alone. Remarkably, the contagion spread across markets: the Bank of England, Royal African Company, and Old East India Company all show synchronized price movements during 1720, rising in sympathy with the South Sea speculation before experiencing their own sharp corrections. Most striking is the Mississippi Company plot, which tracks John Law’s concurrent bubble in France—it peaked slightly earlier than the South Sea Bubble and collapsed even more precipitously, suggesting that speculative manias can propagate across national borders. The synchronization across these four series illustrates volatility clustering and correlation jumps, phenomena that motivate the stochastic volatility models with correlated jumps discussed later in this chapter. These price paths exhibit all three components of the Lévy-Itô decomposition: drift during the accumulation phase, continuous Brownian fluctuations throughout, and sudden Poisson jumps at the moment of collapse.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical Bubbles",

    "text": "7.4 Brownian Motion\nBrownian Motion, named after botanist Robert Brown, is a fundamental concept in the theory of stochastic processes. It describes the random motion of particles suspended in a fluid (liquid or gas), as they are bombarded by the fast-moving molecules in the fluid.\nA one-dimensional Brownian Motion (also known as Wiener process) is a continuous time stochastic process \\(B(t)_{t\\ge 0}\\) with the following properties:\n\n\\(B(0) = 0\\) almost surely\n\\(B(t)\\) has stationary independent increments: \\(B(t) - B(s) \\sim N(0, t-s)\\) for \\(0 \\le s &lt; t\\)\n\\(B(t)\\) is a continuous function of \\(t\\)\nFor each time \\(t &gt; 0\\), the random variable \\(B(t)\\) is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance \\(t\\), i.e., \\(B(t) \\sim N(0, t)\\).\n\nFormally, Brownian motion is a stochastic process \\(B(t)\\) which is a family of real random variables indexed by the set of nonnegative real numbers \\(t\\).\nFigure 7.2 below shows three sample paths of Brownian Motion.\n\n# Brownian Motion\nset.seed(92)\nt = seq(0, 1, 0.001)\nplot(t, cumsum(rnorm(1001, 0, sqrt(0.001))), type=\"l\", xlab=\"t\", ylab=\"B(t)\", lwd=2, ylim=c(-1.2, 2))\nlines(t, cumsum(rnorm(1001, 0, sqrt(0.001))), lwd=2, col=2)\nlines(t, cumsum(rnorm(1001, 0, sqrt(0.001))),lwd=2, col=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Brownian Motion\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, for any times \\(0 \\leq t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; \\ldots &lt; t_n\\), the random variables \\(B(t_2) - B(t_1)\\), \\(B(t_3) - B(t_2)\\), , \\(B(t_n) - B(t_{n-1})\\) are independent and the function \\(t \\mapsto B(t)\\) is continuous almost surely.\nSome properties of Brownian Motion are:\n\nScale Invariance: If \\(B(t)\\) is a Brownian motion, then for any \\(a &gt; 0\\), the process \\(aB(t/a^2)\\) is also a Brownian motion.\nTime Inversion: If \\(B(t)\\) is a Brownian motion, then \\(tB(1/t)\\) is also a Brownian motion for \\(t &gt; 0\\).\nFractal Nature: Brownian motion paths are nowhere differentiable but continuous everywhere, reflecting a fractal-like nature.\n\nHistorically, the most widely used models for stock market returns relied on the assumption that asset returns follow a normal or a lognormal distribution. The lognormal model for asset returns was challenged after the October 1987 crash of the American stock market. On October 19 (Black Monday) the Dow Jones index had fallen 508 points, or 23 percent. It was the worst single day in history for the US markets. The reason for the crash was rather simple: it was caused by the portfolio insurance product created by one of the financial firms. The idea of this insurance was to switch from equities to US Treasury bills as markets go down. Although the lognormal model does a good job of describing the historical data, the jump observed on that day had a probability close to zero, according to the lognormal model. The lognormal model underestimates the probability of a large change (thin tail). The widely used Black-Scholes model for asset pricing was relying on the lognormal model; it was incapable of correctly pricing in the possibility of such a large drop.\nThe normal assumption of asset returns was first proposed in 1900 in the PhD thesis of Louis Bachelier, who was a student of Henri Poincare. Bachelier was interested in developing statistical tools for pricing options (predicting asset returns) on the Paris stock exchange. Although Bachelier’s work laid the foundation for the modern theory of stochastic processes, he was never given credit by his contemporaries, including Einstein, Levy and Borel.\nIn 1905 Einstein published a paper which used the same statistical model as Bachelier to describe the 1827 discovery by botanist Robert Brown, who observed that pollen particles suspended in water followed irregular random trajectories. Thus, we call the stochastic process that describes these phenomena Brownian motion. Einstein’s advisor at the University of Zurich was Hermann Minkowski who was a friend and collaborator of Poincare. Thus, it is likely Einstein knew about the work of Bachelier, but he never mentioned it in his paper. This was not the first instance when Einstein did not give proper credit. Poincare published a paper Poincaré (1898) on relativity theory in 1898, seven years before Einstein. This paper was published in a philosophy journal and thus Poincare avoided using any mathematical formulas except for the famous \\(E=mc^2\\). Poincare discussed his results on relativity theory with Minkowski. Minkowski asked Einstein to read Poincare’s work Arnol’d (2006). However, Einstein never referenced the work of Poincare until 1945. One of the reviewers for the 1905 paper on relativity by Einstein was Poincare and he wrote a very positive review mentioning it as a breakthrough. When Minkowski asked Poincare why he did not claim his priority on the theory, Poincare replied that our mission is to support young scientists. More about why credit is mistakenly given to Einstein for relativity theory is discussed by Logunov Logunov (2004).\nEinstein was not the only one who ignored the work of Bachelier; Paul Levy did so as well. Paul Levy was considered a pioneer and authority on stochastic processes during Bachelier’s time, although Bruno de Finetti introduced a dual concept of infinite divisibility in 1929, before the works of Levy in the early 1930s on this topic. Levy never mentioned the work of the obscure and little known mathematician Bachelier. The first to give credit to Bachelier was Kolmogorov in his 1931 paper Kolmogoroff (1931) (Russian translation A. N. Kolmogorov (1938) and English translation Shiryayev (1992)). Later Leonard Jimmie Savage translated Bachelier’s work to English and showed it to Paul Samuelson. Samuelson extended the work of Bachelier by considering the log-returns rather than absolute numbers, popularized the work of Bachelier among economists and the translation of Bachelier’s thesis was finally published in English in 1964 Cootner (1967). Many economists who extended the work of Bachelier won Nobel prizes, including Eugene Fama known for work on the efficient markets hypothesis, Paul Samuelson, and Myron Scholes for the Black-Scholes model, as well as Robert Merton.\nAlthough it was originally developed to model financial markets by Louis Bachelier in 1900, Brownian Motion has found applications in many other fields: biology (movement of biomolecules within cells), environmental science (diffusion processes, like the spread of pollutants in air or water), and mathematics (stochastic calculus and differential equations).",

    "section": "7.5 Black-Scholes Model for Sports Betting",
    "text": "7.5 Black-Scholes Model for Sports Betting\nSports betting involves wagering on the outcome of athletic events. Bettors’ assessments of these outcomes are aggregated in markets that provide key metrics like the point spread, which is the expected margin of victory, and moneyline odds, which imply the probability of a team winning. These market-based measures can be used to analyze the uncertainty, or volatility, inherent in a sports game.\nTo quantify the uncertainty in a game’s outcome, the score difference between two teams over time can be modeled as a stochastic process. Specifically, we use a Brownian motion model, first proposed by Stern (1994), to represent the evolution of a team’s lead. In this framework, the score difference at time \\(t\\), denoted as \\(X(t)\\), is assumed to follow a normal distribution with a mean (or “drift”) that grows over time and a variance that also increases with time.\nThis can be expressed mathematically as: \\[\nX(t) = \\mu t + \\sigma B(t) \\sim N(\\mu t, \\sigma^2 t)\n\\] where \\(\\mu\\) is the drift parameter, representing the favored team’s point advantage over the whole game (derived from the point spread), \\(\\sigma\\) is the volatility parameter, representing the standard deviation of the final outcome, and \\(t\\) is the time elapsed in the game, scaled from 0 to 1.\nThis model allows for the calculation of a team’s win probability at any point in the game and provides a formal way to measure the uncertainty of the final score.\nThe concept of deriving a game’s volatility from betting markets is directly analogous to the Black-Scholes model in finance. In finance, the Black-Scholes formula is used to price options. If the market price of an option is known, one can work backward to solve for the volatility of the underlying stock; this is called implied volatility. The model in sports betting does the same: it uses the market-set point spread (\\(\\mu\\)) and win probability (\\(p\\)) to solve for the game’s implied volatility (\\(\\sigma\\)).\nBoth models use a Brownian motion framework to describe how a variable changes over time. However, there is a key difference. The sports model uses a standard Brownian motion, where the score changes additively. In contrast, the Black-Scholes model uses a geometric Brownian motion, which assumes that a stock price changes by a certain percentage, not by a fixed amount.\nEssentially, this approach applies the financial concept of implied volatility to the sports world, creating a lens through which betting market data can be interpreted to measure the expected uncertainty of a game.\n\nImplied Volatility for Sports Games\nThe concept of implied volatility is central to understanding how market prices reflect uncertainty. In the context of sports betting, implied volatility represents the market’s assessment of the uncertainty in a game’s final outcome, derived from observable betting market data.\nGiven the point spread \\(\\mu\\) (which represents the expected margin of victory) and the win probability \\(p\\) (derived from moneyline odds), we can solve for the implied volatility \\(\\sigma\\) using the relationship:\n\\[\np = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)\n\\]\nRearranging this equation, the implied volatility is given by:\n\\[\n\\sigma = \\frac{\\mu}{\\Phi^{-1}(p)}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Phi^{-1}\\) is the inverse of the standard normal cumulative distribution function (the quantile function).\nThis approach mirrors the methodology used in financial markets, where option prices are used to infer the market’s expectation of future stock price volatility. In sports betting, the “option price” is effectively the betting odds, and the “underlying asset” is the game outcome. Just as financial implied volatility reflects market sentiment about future price movements, sports implied volatility captures the market’s view of how uncertain or “volatile” a particular game is likely to be.\nFor example, a game between two closely matched teams might have high implied volatility, reflecting greater uncertainty in the outcome, while a game featuring a heavily favored team against a significant underdog would typically exhibit lower implied volatility, as the outcome is more predictable.\n\nExample 7.2 (Black-Scholes Model for Super Bowl) In order to define the implied volatility of a sports game we begin with a distributional model for the evolution of the outcome in a sports game which we develop from Stern (1994). The model specifies the distribution of the lead of team A over team B, \\(X(t)\\) for any \\(t\\) as a Brownian motion process. If \\(B(t)\\) denotes a standard Brownian motion with distributional property \\(B(t) \\sim N(0,t)\\) and we incorporate drift, \\(\\mu\\), and volatility, \\(\\sigma\\), terms, then the evolution of the outcome \\(X(t)\\) that is given by: \\[\nX(t)=\\mu t + \\sigma B(t) \\sim N( \\mu t , \\sigma^2 t).\n\\] This distribution of the game outcome is similar to the Black-Scholes model of the distribution of a stock price.\nThis specification results in several useful measures (or, this specification results in closed-form solutions for a number of measures of interest). The distribution of the final score follows a normal distribution, \\(X(1)\\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). We can calculate the probability of team A winning, denoted \\(p=\\mathbb{P}(X(1)&gt;0)\\), from the spread and probability distribution. Given the normality assumption, \\(X(1) \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), we have \\[\np = \\mathbb{P}(X(1)&gt;0) = \\Phi \\left ( \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma} \\right )\n\\] where \\(\\Phi\\) is the standard normal cdf. Table 7.1 uses \\(\\Phi\\) to convert team A’s advantage \\(\\mu\\) to a probability scale using the information ratio \\(\\mu/\\sigma\\).\n\n\n\nTable 7.1: Probability of Winning \\(p\\) versus the Sharpe Ratio \\(\\mu/\\sigma\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\mu/\\sigma\\)\n0\n0.25\n0.5\n0.75\n1\n1.25\n1.5\n2\n\n\n\n\n\\(p=\\Phi(\\mu/\\sigma)\\)\n0.5\n0.60\n0.69\n0.77\n0.84\n0.89\n0.93\n0.977\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf teams are evenly matched and \\(\\mu/\\sigma =0\\) then \\(p=0.5\\). Table 7.1 provides a list of probabilities as a function of \\(\\mu/\\sigma\\). For example, if the point spread \\(\\mu=-4\\) and volatility is \\(\\sigma=10.6\\), then the team has a \\(\\mu/\\sigma = -4/10.6 = - 0.38\\) volatility point disadvantage. The probability of winning is \\(\\Phi(-0.38) = 0.353 &lt; 0.5\\). A common scenario is that team A has an edge equal to half a volatility, so that \\(\\mu/\\sigma =0.5\\) and then \\(p= 0.69\\).\nOf particular interest here are conditional probability assessments made as the game progresses. For example, suppose that the current lead at time \\(t\\) is \\(l\\) points and so \\(X(t) = l\\). The model can then be used to update your assessment of the distribution of the final score with the conditional distribution \\((X(1) | X(t)=l )\\). To see this, we can re-write the distribution of \\(X(1)\\) given \\(X(t)\\) by noting that \\(X(1) = X(t)+ X(1) - X(t)\\). Using the formula above and substituting \\(t\\) for \\(1\\) where appropriate and noting that \\(X(t) = l\\) by assumption, this simplifies to \\[\nX(1)= l + \\mu(1- t) + \\sigma (B(1) - B(t)).\n\\] Here \\(B(1) - B(t)  \\stackrel{D}{=} B(1-t)\\) which is independent of \\(X(t)\\) with distribution \\(N(0,1-t)\\). The mean and variance of \\(X(1)|X(t)=l\\) decay to zero as \\(t \\rightarrow 1\\) and the outcome becomes certain at the realised value of \\(X(1)\\). We leave open the possibility of a tied game and overtime to determine the outcome.\nTo determine this conditional distribution, we note that there are \\(1-t\\) time units left together with a drift \\(\\mu\\) and as shown above in this case the uncertainty can be modeled as \\(\\sigma^2(1-t)\\). Therefore, we can write the distribution of the final outcome after \\(t\\) periods with a current lead of \\(l\\) for team A as the conditional distribution: \\[\n( X(1) | X(t)=l) =  (X(1)-X(t)) + l   \\sim N( l + \\mu(1 - t) , \\sigma^2 (1 - t) )\n\\] From the conditional distribution \\((X(1) | X(t)=l) \\sim N(l+\\mu(1-t), \\sigma^2 (1-t))\\), we can calculate the conditional probability of winning as the game evolves. The probability of team A winning at time \\(t\\) given a current lead of \\(l\\) point is: \\[\np_t = P ( X(1) &gt; 0 | X(t) = l) = \\Phi \\left ( \\frac{ l + \\mu ( 1 - t)  }{ \\sigma \\sqrt{ ( 1-t) } } \\right )\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Score Evolution on a Discretized Grid\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3 A and B illustrate our methodology with an example. Suppose we are analyzing data for a Superbowl game between teams A and B with team A favored. Figure A presents the information available at the beginning of the game from the perspective of the underdog team B. If the initial point spread—or the market’s expectation of the expected outcome—is \\(-4\\) and the volatility is \\(10.6\\) (assumed given for the moment; more on this below) then the probability that the underdog team wins is \\(p = \\Phi ( \\mu /\\sigma ) = \\Phi ( - 4/ 10.6) = 35.3\\)%. This result relies on our assumption of a normal outcome distribution on the outcome as previously explained. Another way of saying this is \\(\\mathbb{P}(X(1)&gt;0)=0.353\\) for an outcome distribution \\(X(1) \\sim N(-4, 10.6^2)\\). Figure A illustrates this with the shaded red area under the curve.\nFigure 7.3 B illustrates the information and potential outcomes at half-time. Here we show the evolution of the actual score until half time as the solid black line. From half-time onwards we simulate a set of possible Monte Carlo paths to the end of the game.\nSpecifically, we discretise the model with time interval \\(\\Delta =1/200\\) and simulate possible outcomes given the score at half time. The volatility plays a key role in turning the point spread into a probability of winning as the greater the volatility of the distribution of the outcome, \\(X(1)\\), the greater the range of outcomes projected in the Monte Carlo simulation. Essentially the volatility provides a scale which calibrates the advantage implied by a given point spread.\nWe can use this relationship to determine how volatility decays over the course of the game. The conditional distribution of the outcome given the score at time \\(t\\), is \\((X(1)|X(t)=l)\\) with a variance of \\(\\sigma^2(1-t)\\) and volatility of \\(\\sigma \\sqrt{1-t}\\). The volatility is a decreasing function of \\(t\\), illustrating that the volatility dissipates over the course of a game. For example, if there is an initial volatility of \\(\\sigma = 10.6\\), then at half-time when \\(t=\\frac{1}{2}\\), the volatility is \\(10.6 / \\sqrt{2} = 7.5\\) volatility points left. Table 7.2, below, illustrates this relationship for additional points over the game.\n\n\n\nTable 7.2: Volatility Decay over Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)\n0\n\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\n1\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\sigma \\sqrt{1-t}\\)\n10.6\n9.18\n7.50\n5.3\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo provide insight into the final outcome given the current score, Table 7.1 and Table 7.2 can be combined to measure the current outcome, \\(l\\), in terms of standard deviations of the outcome.\nFor example, suppose that you have Team B, an underdog, so from their perspective \\(\\mu = -4\\) and at half-time team B has a lead of 15, \\(l= 15\\). Team B’s expected outcome as presented earlier is \\(l + \\mu (1-t)\\) or \\(15 - 4 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 13\\). If initial volatility is \\(\\sigma = 10.60\\) then the remaining volatility at half-time is \\(10.6/\\sqrt{2} = 7.50\\) and team B’s expected outcome of \\(13\\) in terms of standard deviations is \\(13/7.5 = 1.73\\). Thus team B’s expected outcome is at the 99th percentile of the distribution, \\(\\Phi ( 1.73 ) = 0.96\\), implying a 96% chance of winning.\nImplied Volatility\nThe previous discussion assumed that the variance (or volatility) parameter \\(\\sigma\\) was a known constant. We return to this important quantity now. We are now in a position to define the implied volatility implicit in the two betting lines that are available. Given our model, we will use the money-line odds to provide a market assessment of the probability of winning, \\(p\\), and the point spread to assess the expected margin of victory, \\(\\mu\\). The money line odds are shown for each team A and B and provide information on the payoff from a bet on the team winning. This calculation will also typically require an adjustment for the bookmaker’s spread. With these we can infer the implied volatility, \\(\\sigma_{IV}\\), by solving \\[\n\\sigma_{IV}: \\; \\; \\;  \\; \\; p = \\Phi \\left ( \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma_{IV}} \\right ) \\; \\; \\text{ which \\; gives} \\; \\;\n\\sigma_{IV} = \\frac{ \\mu }{ \\Phi^{-1} ( p ) } \\; .\n\\] Here \\(\\Phi^{-1}(p)\\) denotes the standard normal quantile function such that the area under the standard normal curve to the left of \\(\\Phi^{-1}(p)\\) is equal to \\(p\\). In our example we calculate this using the qnorm in R. Note that when \\(\\mu =0\\) and \\(p= \\frac{1}{2}\\) there’s no market information about the volatility as \\(\\mu / \\Phi^{-1} (p)\\) is undefined. This is the special case where the teams are seen as evenly matched- the expected outcome has a zero point spread and there is an equal probability that either team wins.\nTime Varying Implied Volatility\nUp to this point the volatility rate has been assumed constant through the course of the game, i.e., that the same value of \\(\\sigma\\) is relevant. The amount of volatility remaining in the game is not constant but the basic underlying parameters has been assumed constant. This need not be true and more importantly the betting markets may provide some information about the best estimate of the volatility parameter at a given point of time. This is important because time-varying volatility provides an interpretable quantity that can allow one to assess the value of a betting opportunity.\nWith the advent of online betting there is a virtually continuous traded contract available to assess implied expectations of the probability of team A winning at any time \\(t\\). The additional information available from the continuous contract allows for further update of the implied conditional volatility. We assume that the online betting market gives us a current assessment of \\(p_t\\), that is the current probability that team A will win. We will then solve for \\(\\sigma^2\\) and in turn define resulting time-varying volatility, as \\(\\sigma_{IV,t}\\), using the resulting equation to solve for \\(\\sigma_{IV,t}\\) with \\[\np_t = \\Phi \\left ( \\frac{ l + \\mu(1-t)  }{\\sigma_{IV,t} \\sqrt{1-t}} \\right )\n\\; \\text{ which \\; gives} \\; \\;\n\\sigma_{IV,t} = \\frac{ l + \\mu ( 1-t ) }{ \\Phi^{-1} ( p_t )  \\sqrt{1-t}}\n\\] We will use our methodology to find evidence of time-varying volatility in the SuperBowl XLVII probabilities.\nSuper Bowl XLVII: Ravens vs San Francisco 49ers\nSuper Bowl XLVII was held at the Superdome in New Orleans on February 3, 2013 and featured the San Francisco 49ers against the Baltimore Ravens. Going into Super Bowl XLVII the San Francisco 49ers were favorites to win which was not surprising following their impressive season. It was a fairly bizarre Super Bowl with a \\(34\\) minute power outage affecting the game by ultimately an exciting finish with the Ravens causing an upset victory \\(34-31\\). We will build our model from the viewpoint of the Ravens. Hence \\(X(t)\\) will correspond to the Raven’s score minus the San Francisco 49ers. Table 7.3 provides the score at the end of each quarter.\n\n\n\nTable 7.3: SuperBowl XLVII by Quarter\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)\n0\n\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\n1\n\n\n\n\nRavens\n0\n7\n21\n28\n34\n\n\n49ers\n0\n3\n6\n23\n31\n\n\n\\(X(t)\\)\n0\n4\n15\n5\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo determine the parameters of our model we first use the point spread which was set at the Ravens being a four point underdog, i.e. \\(\\mu=-4\\). This sets the mean of our outcome, \\(X(1)\\), as \\[\n\\mu = \\mathbb{E} \\left (X(1) \\right )=-4 .\n\\] In reality, it was an exciting game with the Ravens upsetting the 49ers by \\(34-31\\). Hence, the realised outcome is \\(X(1)= 34-31=3\\) with the point spread being beaten by \\(7\\) points or the equivalent of a touchdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Superbowl XLVII: Ravens vs 49ers: TradeSports contracts traded and dynamic probability of the Ravens winning\n\n\n\nTo determine the markets’ assessment of the probability that the Ravens would win at the beginning of the game we use the money-line odds. These odds were quoted as San Francisco \\(-175\\) and Baltimore Ravens \\(+155\\). This implies that a bettor would have to place $175 to win $100 on the 49ers and a bet of $100 on the Ravens would lead to a win of $155. We can convert both of these money-lines to implied probabilities of the each team winning, by the equations \\[\np_{SF} = \\frac{175}{100+175} = 0.686 \\; \\; \\text{ and} \\; \\; p_{Ravens} = \\frac{100}{100+155} = 0.392\n\\] The probability sum to one plus the market overround: \\[\np_{SF} + p_{Ravens} = 0.686+0.392 = 1.078\n\\] namely a \\(7.8\\)% edge for the bookmakers. Put differently, if bettors place money proportionally across both teams then the bookies vig will be \\[\n\\text{Vig} = \\dfrac{0.078}{0.078+1} = 0.072\n\\] This means that the bookmaker is expected to make a profit of 7.2% of the total amount staked, no matter what happens to the outcome of the game.\nTo account for this edge in our model, we use the mid-point of the spread to determine \\(p\\) implying that \\[\np = \\frac{1}{2} p_{Ravens} + \\frac{1}{2} (1 - p_{SF} ) = 0.353\n\\] From the Ravens perspective we have \\(p = \\mathbb{P}(X(1)&gt;0) =0.353\\).\nFigure 7.4 shows the evolution of the markets conditional probability of winning \\(p_t\\) for the Ravens. The data are from the online betting website TradeSports.com. Starting at \\(p=0.353\\) we see how dramatically the markets assessment of the Ravens winning can fluctuate. Given their commanding lead at half time, the probability has as high as \\(0.90\\). At the end of the four quarter when the 49ers nearly went into the lead with a touchdown, at one point the probability had dropped to \\(30\\)%.\nOur main question of interest is then: What implied volatility is consistent with market expectations?\nTo calculate the implied volatility of the Superbowl we substitute the pair \\((\\mu,p)\\) into our definition and solve for \\(\\sigma_{IV}\\). We obtain \\[\n\\sigma_{IV} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\Phi^{-1}(p)} = \\frac{-4}{-0.377}  = 10.60\n\\] where we have used \\(\\Phi^{-1} ( p) = qnorm(0.353) = -0.377\\). So on a volatility scale the \\(4\\) point advantage assessed for the 49ers is under a \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma\\) favorite. From Table 2, this is consistent with a win probability of \\(p=\\Phi(\\frac{1}{2})=0.69\\). Another feature is that a \\(\\sigma=10.6\\) is historically low, as a typical volatility of an NFL game is \\(14\\) (see Stern, 1991). However, the more competitive the game one might expect a lower volatility. In reality, the outcome \\(X(1)=3\\) was within one standard deviation of the model, which had an expectation of \\(\\mu=-4\\) and volatility \\(\\sigma=10.6\\). Another question of interest is\nWhat’s the probability of the Ravens winning given their lead at half time?\n\nAt half-time the Ravens were leading \\(21\\) to \\(6\\). This gives us \\(X(\\frac{1}{2})=21-6=15\\). From the online betting market we also have traded contracts on TradeSports.com that yield a current probability of \\(p_{\\frac{1}{2}} = 0.90\\). \nAn alternative view is to assume that the market assesses time varying volatility and the prices fully reflect the underlying probability. Here we ask the question\nWhat’s the implied volatility for the second half of the game?\nWe now have an implied volatility \\[\n\\sigma_{IV,t=\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{ l + \\mu ( 1-t ) }{ \\Phi^{-1} ( p_t )  \\sqrt{1-t}} = \\frac{15-2}{ \\Phi^{-1}(0.9) / \\sqrt{2} } = 14\n\\] where qnorm(0.9)=1.28. Notice that \\(14&gt; 10.6\\), our assessment of the implied volatility at the beginning of the game.\nWhat’s a valid betting strategy?\nAn alternative approach is to assume that the initial moneyline and point spread set the volatility and this stays constant throughout the game. This market is much larger than the online market and this is a reasonable assumption unless there has been material information as the game progresses such as a key injury.\nHence the market was expected a more typical volatility in the second half. If a bettor believed that there was no reason that \\(\\sigma\\) had changed from the initial \\(10.6\\) then their assessment of the Ravens win probability, under this models, would have been \\(\\Phi \\left ( 13/ (10.6/\\sqrt{2}) \\right ) = 0.96\\) and the \\(0.90\\) market rate would have been thought of as a betting opportunity.\nThe Kelly criterion (Kelly,1956) yields the betting rate \\[\n\\omega = p - \\dfrac{q}{b} = 0.96 - \\frac{0.1}{1/9} = 0.06\n\\] that is, \\(6\\)% of capital. A more realistic strategy is to use the fractional Kelly criterion, which scales the bet by a risk-aversion parameter \\(\\gamma\\). For example, in this case if \\(\\gamma =3\\), we would bet \\(0.06/3=0.02\\), or \\(2\\)% of our capital on this betting opportunity.\nFinally, odds changes can be dramatic at the end of the fourth quarter, and this Super Bowl was no exception. With the score at \\(34\\)–\\(29\\) and only a few minutes remaining, the 49ers were at first-and-goal. A few minutes after this, the probability of the Ravens winning had dropped precipitously from over \\(90\\)% to \\(30\\)%, see Figure 7.4. On San Francisco’s final offensive play of the game, Kaepernick threw a pass on fourth down to Michael Crabtree, but Ravens cornerback Jimmy Smith appeared to hold the wide receiver during the incompletion, No call was given and the final result was a Ravens win.\n\n\nExample 7.3 (Yahoo Stock Price Simulation) Investing in volatile stocks can be very risky. The Internet stocks during the late 1990’s were notorious for their volatility. For example, the leading Internet stock Yahoo! started 1999 at $62,rose to $122, then fell back to $55 in August, only to end the year at $216. Even more remarkable is the fact that by January 2000, Yahoo! has risen more than 100-fold from its offering price of $1.32 on April 15, 1996. In comparison, theNasdaq 100, a benchmark market index, was up about 5-fold during the same period.\nStock prices fluctuate somewhat randomly. Maurice Kendall, in his seminal 1953 paper on the random walk nature of stock and commodity prices, observed that “The series looks like a wandering one, almost as if once a week the Demon of Chance drew a random number from a symmetrical population of fixed dispersion and added to it the current price to determine next week’s price (p. 87).” While a pure random walk model for Yahoo!’s stock price is in fact not reasonable since its price cannot fall below zero, an alternative model that appears to provide reasonable results assumes that the logarithms of price changes, or returns, follow a random walk. This alternative model is the basis for the results in this example.\nTo evaluate a stock investment, we take the initial price as \\(X_0\\) and then we need to determine what the stock price might be in year \\(T\\), namely \\(X_T\\). Our approach draws from the Black-Scholes Model for valuing stock options. Technically, the Black-Scholes Model assumes that \\(X_T\\) is determined by the solution to a stochastic differential equation. This leads to the Geometric Brownian Motion \\[\nX_T = X_0 \\exp\\left( (\\mu - 1/2\\sigma^2)T + \\sigma B_T  \\right),\n\\] where \\(B_T\\) is a standard Brownian motion; that is, \\(B_0 = 0\\), \\(B_t - B_s\\) is independent of \\(B_s\\), and its distribution depends only on \\(t-s\\) with \\(B_t \\sim N(0,t)\\). Hence, \\(B_t = \\sqrt{t}Z\\), where \\(Z \\sim N(0,1)\\).\nThen, the expected value is \\[\\begin{align*}\nE(X_T) = &X_0 \\exp\\left( (\\mu - 1/2\\sigma^2)T \\right) E(\\exp(\\sigma B_T))\\\\\n& = X_0\\exp\\left( (\\mu - 1/2\\sigma^2)T \\right) E(\\exp(\\sigma \\sqrt{T}Z))\\\\\n& = X_0\\exp\\left( (\\mu - 1/2\\sigma^2)T \\right) E(\\exp(\\sigma \\sqrt{T}Z)) \\\\\n&= X_0\\exp\\left( (\\mu - 1/2\\sigma^2)T \\right) \\exp\\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2T \\right) = X_0\\exp\\left( \\mu T \\right).\n\\end{align*}\\] The \\(E(\\exp(\\sigma \\sqrt{T}Z)) = \\exp\\left( 1/2\\sigma^2T \\right)\\) is due to the moment property of the log-normal distribution. We can interpret \\(\\mu\\) as the expected rate of return \\[\n\\hat \\mu = \\frac{1}{T}\\log\\left( \\frac{X_T}{X_0} \\right).\n\\] This provides a way to estimate the expected rate of return from the expected value of the stock price at time \\(T\\), by plugging in the observed values of \\(X_0\\) and \\(X_T\\).\nThe variance is \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Var}(X_T) = &X_0^2 \\exp\\left( 2(\\mu - 1/2\\sigma^2)T \\right) \\text{Var}(\\exp(\\sigma B_T))\\\\\n& = X_0^2 \\exp\\left( 2(\\mu - 1/2\\sigma^2)T \\right) \\text{Var}(\\exp(\\sigma \\sqrt{T}Z))\\\\\n& = X_0^2 \\exp\\left( 2(\\mu - 1/2\\sigma^2)T \\right) \\exp\\left( \\sigma^2T \\right) - X_0^2\\exp\\left( 2(\\mu - 1/2\\sigma^2)T \\right)\\\\\n& = X_0^2\\exp\\left( 2\\mu T \\right)\\left( \\exp\\left( \\sigma^2T \\right) - 1 \\right).\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe important consequence of the model for predicting future prices is that \\(\\log(X_T/X_0)\\) has a normal distribution with mean \\((\\mu-\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2)T\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2 T\\) which is equivalent to saying that the ratio \\(X_T/X_0\\) has a log-normal distribution. It is interesting that although the Black-Scholes result is a standard tool for valuing options in finance the log-normal predictive distribution that follows from its assumptions is not commonly studied. In order to forecast \\(X_T\\) we need to estimate the unknowns \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) (recall \\(X_0\\) is known). The unknown parameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) can be interpreted as the instantaneous expected rate of return and the volatility, respectively. The mean parameter \\(\\mu\\) is known as the expected rate of return because the expected value of \\(X_T\\) is \\(X_0e^{\\mu T}\\). There are a number of ways of estimating the unknown parameters. One approach is to use an equilibrium model for returns, such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model or CAPM. We will discuss this model later. Another approach is to use historical data to estimate the parameters. For example, the expected rate of return can be estimated as the average historical return. The volatility can be estimated as the standard deviation of historical returns. The Black-Scholes model is a continuous time model, but in practice we use discrete time data. The Black-Scholes model can be adapted to discrete time by replacing the continuous time Brownian motion with a discrete time random walk.",

    "text": "7.6 Poisson Process\nA Poisson process is a fundamental stochastic process for modeling the occurrence of random events over time or space. It describes situations where events happen independently at a constant average rate, such as customer arrivals at a store, calls arriving at a call center, or goals scored in a soccer match.\nFormally, a counting process \\(\\{N(t), t \\geq 0\\}\\) is a Poisson process with rate parameter \\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\) if it satisfies the following properties:\n\n\\(N(0) = 0\\) (the process starts at zero)\nThe process has independent increments: for any \\(0 \\leq t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; \\ldots &lt; t_n\\), the random variables \\(N(t_2) - N(t_1), N(t_3) - N(t_2), \\ldots, N(t_n) - N(t_{n-1})\\) are independent\nThe process has stationary increments: for any \\(s &lt; t\\), the distribution of \\(N(t) - N(s)\\) depends only on the length of the interval \\(t - s\\)\nFor any interval of length \\(t\\), the number of events follows a Poisson distribution: \\[\nP(N(t) = k) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda t}(\\lambda t)^k}{k!}, \\quad k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots\n\\]\n\nThe parameter \\(\\lambda\\) represents the rate at which events occur per unit time. The expected number of events in an interval of length \\(t\\) is \\(\\E{N(t)} = \\lambda t\\), and the variance is \\(\\Var{N(t)} = \\lambda t\\).\nFigure 7.5 below shows three sample paths of a Poisson process with rate \\(\\lambda = 5\\) events per unit time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.5: Poisson Process Trajectories\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equivalent characterization of the Poisson process is through the inter-arrival times between consecutive events. If \\(T_1, T_2, \\ldots\\) denote the times between successive events, then these are independent and identically distributed exponential random variables with mean \\(1/\\lambda\\). This connection between the Poisson and exponential distributions is fundamental: the Poisson process counts events while the exponential distribution models the waiting time between events.\nThe Poisson process can be viewed from two complementary perspectives. From a continuous-time viewpoint, we track the evolution of the counting process \\(N(t)\\) as time progresses, asking questions about the probability of observing a certain number of events by time \\(t\\) or the distribution of event times. From a discrete count data perspective, we observe the number of events that occurred during a fixed time interval and use this to make inferences about the underlying rate parameter \\(\\lambda\\).\nChapter 3 introduced Poisson models in the context of count data and Bayesian inference. The Poisson distribution (discussed in the section on Poisson Model for Count Data) emerges naturally when we observe a Poisson process over a fixed time interval. For instance, when modeling the number of goals scored by a soccer team in a match, we implicitly assume that goals occur according to a Poisson process with some rate \\(\\lambda\\), and we observe the total count at the end of the match.\nThe Bayesian approach to learning about the rate parameter \\(\\lambda\\) (covered in the section on Poisson-Gamma: Learning about a Poisson Intensity in Chapter 3) becomes particularly powerful in the continuous-time setting. When we observe a Poisson process over time, we can update our beliefs about \\(\\lambda\\) as new events occur. The Gamma distribution serves as a conjugate prior for \\(\\lambda\\), meaning that if we start with a Gamma prior and observe events from a Poisson process, the posterior distribution remains in the Gamma family with updated parameters. This elegant updating mechanism allows us to refine our estimates of the event rate as we gather more data, balancing prior beliefs with observed evidence.\nThe connection between these perspectives is crucial for applications. In many real-world scenarios, we observe event counts over fixed intervals (discrete perspective) but need to make predictions about future events or the timing of the next event (continuous perspective). The Poisson process framework unifies these views, allowing us to seamlessly move between counting events and modeling their temporal dynamics.\n\nExample 7.4 (EPL Betting) Feng, Polson, and Xu (2016) employ a Skellam process (a difference of Poisson random variables) to model real-time betting odds for English Premier League (EPL) soccer games. Given a matrix of market odds on all possible score outcomes, we estimate the expected scoring rates for each team. The expected scoring rates then define the implied volatility of an EPL game. As events in the game evolve, they re-estimate the expected scoring rates and our implied volatility measure to provide a dynamic representation of the market’s expectation of the game outcome. They use real-time market odds data for a game between Everton and West Ham in the 2015-2016 season. We show how the implied volatility for the outcome evolves as goals, red cards, and corner kicks occur.\nGambling on soccer is a global industry with revenues of over $1 trillion a year (see “Football Betting - the Global Gambling Industry worth Billions,” BBC Sport). Betting on the result of a soccer match is a rapidly growing market, and online real-time odds exist (Betfair, Bet365, Ladbrokes). Market odds for all possible score outcomes (\\(0-0, 1-0, 0-1, 2-0, \\ldots\\)) as well as outright win, lose, and draw are available in real time. In this paper, we employ a two-parameter probability model based on a Skellam process and a non-linear objective function to extract the expected scoring rates for each team from the odds matrix. The expected scoring rates then define the implied volatility of the game.\nSkellam Process\nTo model the outcome of a soccer game between team A and team B, we let the difference in scores, \\(N(t) = N_A(t) - N_B(t)\\), where \\(N_A(t)\\) and \\(N_B(t)\\) are the team scores at time point \\(t\\). Negative values of \\(N(t)\\) indicate that team A is behind. We begin at \\(N(0) = 0\\) and end at time one with \\(N(1)\\) representing the final score difference. The probability \\(\\mathbb{P}(N(1) &gt; 0)\\) represents the ex-ante odds of team A winning. Half-time score betting, which is common in Europe, is available for the distribution of \\(N(\\frac{1}{2})\\).\nThen we find a probabilistic model for the distribution of \\(N(1)\\) given \\(N(t) = \\ell\\), where \\(\\ell\\) is the current lead. This model, together with the current market odds, can be used to infer the expected scoring rates of the two teams and then to define the implied volatility of the outcome of the match. We let \\(\\lambda^A\\) and \\(\\lambda^B\\) denote the expected scoring rates for the whole game. We allow for the possibility that the scoring abilities (and their market expectations) are time-varying, in which case we denote the expected scoring rates after time \\(t\\) by \\(\\lambda^A_t\\) and \\(\\lambda^B_t\\), respectively, instead of \\(\\lambda^A(1-t)\\) and \\(\\lambda^B(1-t)\\).\nThe Skellam distribution is defined as the difference between two independent Poisson variables given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nN_A(t) &= W_A(t) + W(t) \\\\\nN_B(t) &= W_B(t) + W(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(W_A(t)\\), \\(W_B(t)\\), and \\(W(t)\\) are independent processes with:\n\\[\nW_A(t) \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda^A t), \\quad W_B(t) \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda^B t).\n\\]\nHere \\(W(t)\\) is a non-negative integer-valued process to induce a correlation between the numbers of goals scored. By modeling the score difference, \\(N(t)\\), we avoid having to specify the distribution of \\(W(t)\\) as the difference in goals scored is independent of \\(W(t)\\). Specifically, we have a Skellam distribution:\n\\[\nN(t) = N_A(t) - N_B(t) \\sim \\text{Skellam}(\\lambda^A t, \\lambda^B t).\n\\tag{7.1}\\]\nAt time \\(t\\), we have the conditional distributions:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nW_A(1) - W_A(t) &\\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda^A(1-t)) \\\\\nW_B(1) - W_B(t) &\\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda^B(1-t)).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNow letting \\(N^*(1-t)\\), the score difference of the sub-game which starts at time \\(t\\) and ends at time 1 and the duration is \\((1-t)\\). By construction, \\(N(1) = N(t) + N^*(1-t)\\). Since \\(N^*(1-t)\\) and \\(N(t)\\) are differences of two Poisson process on two disjoint time periods, by the property of Poisson process, \\(N^*(1-t)\\) and \\(N(t)\\) are independent. Hence, we can re-express equation (Equation 7.1) in terms of \\(N^*(1-t)\\), and deduce\n\\[\n%N^*(1-t) = W^*_A(1-t) - W^*_B(1-t) \\sim Skellam(\\lambda^A (1-t),\\lambda^B (1-t) )\nN^*(1-t) = W^*_A(1-t) - W^*_B(1-t) \\sim \\text{Skellam}(\\lambda^A_t,\\lambda^B_t)\n\\]\nwhere \\(W^*_A(1-t) = W_A(1) - W_A(t)\\), \\(\\lambda^A = \\lambda^A_0\\) and \\(\\lambda^A_t=\\lambda^A(1-t)\\). A natural interpretation of the expected scoring rates, \\(\\lambda^A_t\\) and \\(\\lambda^B_t\\), is that they reflect the “net” scoring ability of each team from time \\(t\\) to the end of the game. The term \\(W(t)\\) models a common strength due to external factors, such as weather. The “net” scoring abilities of the two teams are assumed to be independent of each other as well as the common strength factor. We can calculate the probability of any particular score difference, given by \\(\\mathbb{P}(N(1)=x|\\lambda^A,\\lambda^B)\\), at the end of the game where the \\(\\lambda\\)’s are estimated from the matrix of market odds. Team strength and “net” scoring ability can be influenced by various underlying factors, such as the offensive and defensive abilities of the two teams. The goal of our analysis is to only represent these parameters at every instant as a function of the market odds matrix for all scores.\nAnother quantity of interest is the conditional probability of winning as the game progresses. If the current lead at time \\(t\\) is \\(\\ell\\), and \\(N(t)=\\ell=N_A(t)-N_B(t)\\), the Poisson property implied that the final score difference \\((N(1)|N(t)=\\ell)\\) can be calculated by using the fact that \\(N(1)=N(t)+N^*(1-t)\\) and \\(N(t)\\) and \\(N^*(1-t)\\) are independent. Specifically, conditioning on \\(N(t)=\\ell\\), we have the identity\n\\[ N(1)=N(t)+N^*(1-t)=\\ell+\\text{Skellam}(\\lambda^A_t,\\lambda^B_t). \\]\nWe are now in a position to find the conditional distribution (\\(N(1)=x|N(t)=\\ell\\)) for every time point \\(t\\) of the game given the current score. Simply put, we have the time homogeneous condition\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{P}(N(1)=x|\\lambda^A_t,\\lambda^B_t,N(t)=\\ell) &= \\mathbb{P}(N(1)-N(t)=x-\\ell |\\lambda^A_t,\\lambda^B_t,N(t)=\\ell) \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{P}(N^* (1-t)=x-\\ell |\\lambda^A_t,\\lambda^B_t)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\lambda^A_t\\), \\(\\lambda^B_t\\), \\(\\ell\\) are given by market expectations at time \\(t\\). See Feng et al. for details.\nMarket Calibration\nOur information set at time \\(t\\) includes the current lead \\(N(t) = \\ell\\) and the market odds for \\(\\{Win, Lose, Draw, Score\\}_t\\), where \\(Score_t = \\{ ( i - j ) : i, j = 0, 1, 2, ....\\}\\). These market odds can be used to calibrate a Skellam distribution which has only two parameters \\(\\lambda^A_t\\) and \\(\\lambda^B_t\\). The best fitting Skellam model with parameters \\(\\{\\hat\\lambda^A_t,\\hat\\lambda^B_t\\}\\) will then provide a better estimate of the market’s information concerning the outcome of the game than any individual market (such as win odds) as they are subject to a “vig” and liquidity.\nSuppose that the fractional odds for all possible final score outcomes are given by a bookmaker. Fractional odds, commonly used in the UK, express the ratio of profit to stake. For example, odds of \\(3:1\\) (read as “three-to-one”) mean that for every $1 wagered, the bettor receives $3 in profit if the bet wins, plus the original $1 stake returned, for a total payout of $4. In this case, if the bookmaker offers \\(3:1\\) odds on a 2-1 final score, the bookmaker pays out three times the amount staked by the bettor if the outcome is indeed 2-1. This contrasts with American money-line odds, where positive numbers indicate the profit on a $100 stake (e.g., +300 means $300 profit on $100 wagered), and negative numbers indicate the stake needed to win $100.\nThe market implied probability makes the expected winning amount of a bet equal to 0. For fractional odds of \\(3:1\\), the implied probability is calculated as \\(p = \\frac{1}{1+3} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\\) or 25%. We can verify this creates a fair bet: the expected winning amount is \\(\\mu = -1 \\times (1-1/4) + 3 \\times (1/4) = -0.75 + 0.75 = 0\\). We denote these odds as \\(odds(2,1) = 3\\). To convert all the available odds to implied probabilities, we use the identity\n\\[ \\mathbb{P}(N_A(1) = i, N_B(1) = j)=\\frac{1}{1+odds(i,j)}. \\]\nThe market odds matrix, \\(O\\), with elements \\(o_{ij}=odds(i-1,j-1)\\), \\(i,j=1,2,3...\\) provides all possible combinations of final scores. Odds on extreme outcomes are not offered by the bookmakers. Since the probabilities are tiny, we set them equal to 0. The sum of the possible probabilities is still larger than 1 (see Dixon and Coles (1997) and Dixon and Coles (1997)). This “excess” probability corresponds to a quantity known as the “market vig.” For example, if the sum of all the implied probabilities is 1.1, then the expected profit of the bookmaker is 10%. To account for this phenomenon, we scale the probabilities to sum to 1 before estimation.\nTo estimate the expected scoring rates, \\(\\lambda^A_t\\) and \\(\\lambda^B_t\\), for the sub-game \\(N^*(1-t)\\), the odds from a bookmaker should be adjusted by \\(N_A(t)\\) and \\(N_B(t)\\). For example, if \\(N_A(0.5)=1\\), \\(N_B(0.5)=0\\) and \\(odds(2,1)=3\\) at half time, these observations actually says that the odds for the second half score being 1-1 is 3 (the outcomes for the whole game and the first half are 2-1 and 1-0 respectively, thus the outcome for the second half is 1-1). The adjusted \\({odds}^*\\) for \\(N^*(1-t)\\) is calculated using the original odds as well as the current scores and given by\n\\[\n{odds}^*(x,y)=odds(x+N_A(t),y+N_B(t)).\n\\]\nAt time \\(t\\) \\((0\\leq t\\leq 1)\\), we calculate the implied conditional probabilities of score differences using odds information\n\\[\n\\mathbb{P}(N(1)=k|N(t)=\\ell)=\\mathbb{P}(N^*(1-t)=k-\\ell)=\\frac{1}{c}\\sum_{i-j=k-\\ell}\\frac{1}{1+{odds}^*(i,j)}\n\\]\nwhere \\(c=\\sum_{i,j} \\frac{1}{1+{odds}^*(i,j)}\\) is a scale factor, \\(\\ell=N_A(t)-N_B(t)\\), \\(i,j\\geq 0\\) and \\(k=0,\\pm 1,\\pm 2\\ldots\\).\nExample: Everton vs West Ham (3/5/2016)\nTable below shows the implied Skellam probabilities.\n\n\n\nTable 7.4: Table: Original odds data from Ladbrokes before the game started.\n\n\n\n\n\nEverton  West Ham\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n\n\n\n0\n11/1\n12/1\n28/1\n66/1\n200/1\n450/1\n\n\n1\n13/2\n6/1\n14/1\n40/1\n100/1\n350/1\n\n\n2\n7/1\n7/1\n14/1\n40/1\n125/1\n225/1\n\n\n3\n11/1\n11/1\n20/1\n50/1\n125/1\n275/1\n\n\n4\n22/1\n22/1\n40/1\n100/1\n250/1\n500/1\n\n\n5\n50/1\n50/1\n90/1\n150/1\n400/1\n\n\n\n6\n100/1\n100/1\n200/1\n250/1\n\n\n\n\n7\n250/1\n275/1\n375/1\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n325/1\n475/1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.4 shows the raw data of odds right the game. We need to transform odds data into probabilities. For example, for the outcome 0-0, 11/1 is equivalent to a probability of 1/12. Then we can calculate the marginal probability of every score difference from -4 to 5. We neglect those extreme scores with small probabilities and rescale the sum of event probabilities to one.\n\n\n\nTable 7.5: Market implied probabilities for the score differences versus Skellam implied probabilities at different time points.

As we see, the Skellam model appears to have longer tails. Different from independent Poisson modeling in Dixon and Coles (1997), our model is more flexible with the correlation between two teams. However, the trade-off of flexibility is that we only know the probability of score difference instead of the exact scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.6: The betting market data for Everton and West Ham is from ladbrokes.com. Market implied probabilities (expressed as percentages) for three different results (Everton wins, West Ham wins and draw) are marked by three distinct colors, which vary dynamically as the game proceeds. The solid black line shows the evolution of the implied volatility. The dashed line shows significant events in the game, such as goals and red cards. Five goals in this game are 13’ Everton, 56’ Everton, 78’ West Ham, 81’ West Ham and 90’ West Ham.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.6 examines the behavior of the two teams and represent the market predictions on the final result. Notably, we see the probability change of win/draw/loss for important events during the game: goals scoring and a red card penalty. In such a dramatic game, the winning probability of Everton gets raised to 90% before the first goal of West Ham in 78th minutes. The first two goals scored by West Ham in the space of 3 minutes completely reverses the probability of winning. The probability of draw gets raised to 90% until we see the last-gasp goal of West Ham that decides the game.\nFigure 7.6 plots the path of implied volatility throughout the course of the game. Instead of a downward sloping line, we see changes in the implied volatility as critical moments occur in the game. The implied volatility path provides a visualization of the conditional variation of the market prediction for the score difference. For example, when Everton lost a player by a red card penalty at 34th minute, our estimates \\(\\hat\\lambda^A_t\\) and \\(\\hat\\lambda^B_t\\) change accordingly. There is a jump in implied volatility and our model captures the market expectation adjustment about the game prediction. The change in \\(\\hat\\lambda_A\\) and \\(\\hat\\lambda_B\\) are consistent with the findings of Vecer, Kopriva, and Ichiba (2009) where the scoring intensity of the penalized team drops while the scoring intensity of the opposing team increases. When a goal is scored in the 13th minute, we see the increase of \\(\\hat\\lambda^B_t\\) and the market expects that the underdog team is pressing to come back into the game, an effect that has been well-documented in the literature. Another important effect that we observe at the end of the game is that as goals are scored (in the 78th and 81st minutes), the markets expectation is that the implied volatility increases again as one might expect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.7: Red line: the path of implied volatility throughout the game, i.e., \\(\\sigma_{t}^{red} = \\sqrt{\\hat\\lambda^A_t+\\hat\\lambda^B_t}\\).

    "text": "7.7 Stochastic Volatility: Financial Economics\nFinancial markets exhibit time-varying volatility—periods of calm trading alternate with episodes of extreme price movements. The October 1987 crash dramatically illustrated the limitations of constant volatility models: the Dow Jones index fell 23% in a single day, an event that had probability essentially zero under the lognormal model assumed by the Black-Scholes framework. This observation motivated the development of stochastic volatility models that allow uncertainty itself to evolve randomly over time.\nRobert Merton, who was a student of Samuelson, proposed a major extension to the work of Bachelier by introducing jumps to the model. The additive jump term addresses the issues of asymmetry and heavy tails in the distribution. Merton’s Jump Stochastic volatility model has a discrete-time version for log-returns, \\(y_t\\), with jump times, \\(J_t\\), jump sizes, \\(Z_t\\), and spot stochastic volatility, \\(V_t\\), given by the dynamics \\[\\begin{align*}\n    y_{t} & \\equiv \\log \\left( S_{t}/S_{t-1}\\right) =\\mu + V_t \\varepsilon_{t}+J_{t}Z_{t} \\\\V_{t+1} & = \\alpha_v + \\beta_v V_t + \\sigma_v \\sqrt{V_t} \\varepsilon_{t}^v\n\\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\mathbb{P} \\left ( J_t =1 \\right ) = \\lambda\\), \\(S_t\\) denotes a stock or asset price and log-returns \\(y^t = (y_1,\\ldots,y_t)\\) are the log-returns. The errors \\((\\varepsilon_{t},\\varepsilon_{t}^v)\\) are possibly correlated bivariate normals. The investor must obtain optimal filters for \\((V_t,J_t,Z_t)\\), and learn the posterior densities of the parameters \\((\\mu, \\alpha_v, \\beta_v, \\sigma_v^2 , \\lambda )\\). These estimates will be conditional on the information available at each time.\n\nMotivation: Combining Brownian Motion and Jumps\nThe Lévy-Itô decomposition provides the theoretical foundation for modeling asset prices. Recall that any Lévy process can be decomposed into three fundamental components: deterministic drift, continuous Brownian fluctuations, and discrete jumps. In finance, this decomposition maps naturally to observed price dynamics:\n\nDrift (\\(\\mu t\\)): The expected return on the asset, reflecting long-term growth trends\nBrownian component (\\(\\sigma B_t\\)): Continuous price fluctuations driven by the steady arrival of market information\n\nJump component (\\(\\sum_{i=1}^{N_t} Z_i\\)): Sudden price movements triggered by earnings announcements, regulatory changes, or macroeconomic shocks\n\nTraditional models like Black-Scholes use only the first two components, assuming constant volatility \\(\\sigma\\). However, empirical evidence overwhelmingly shows that volatility itself is stochastic and exhibits its own patterns: it clusters (high volatility follows high volatility), it mean-reverts to long-run averages, and it can experience sudden jumps during crises.\nStochastic volatility models extend the Lévy-Itô framework by allowing the volatility parameter to follow its own stochastic process. The most general formulation combines:\n\nBrownian motion for continuous price and volatility fluctuations\nPoisson processes for rare but important jump events in both prices and volatility\nCorrelation structure to capture the leverage effect—the empirical observation that volatility tends to rise when prices fall\n\nThis integration of the two fundamental stochastic processes creates a flexible modeling framework capable of capturing the rich dynamics observed in financial markets.\n\nExample 7.5 (Financial Crashes and the Need for Jumps) Consider the distribution of daily S&P 500 returns. Under a Gaussian model with annualized volatility of 15%, a one-day drop of 5% should occur roughly once every 10,000 years. Yet such events occurred multiple times in recent decades: October 1987 (-20.5%), October 2008 (-9.0%), March 2020 (-12.0%). The empirical distribution exhibits heavy tails—extreme events occur far more frequently than predicted by the normal distribution.\nJump-diffusion models accommodate these events naturally. Instead of treating crashes as impossible outliers, they model them as rare but expected occurrences from the Poisson jump component. This provides more realistic risk assessment and option pricing, particularly for out-of-the-money puts that protect against market crashes.\n\n\n\nThe Stochastic Volatility Model\nThe basic stochastic volatility (SV) model extends the geometric Brownian motion of Black-Scholes by allowing volatility to evolve as a latent stochastic process. In continuous time, the log-price \\(\\log S_t\\) and its variance \\(v_t\\) jointly evolve as:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nd\\log S_{t} &= \\mu dt + \\sqrt{v_t} dB_{t}^{s}  \\\\\nd\\log v_{t} &= \\kappa_{v}(\\theta_{v} - \\log v_t) dt + \\sigma_{v} dB_{t}^{v}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(B_{t}^{s}\\) and \\(B_{t}^{v}\\) are (potentially correlated) Brownian motions. The variance follows a mean-reverting process in logs with:\n\n\\(\\theta_v\\): Long-run average log-variance\n\\(\\kappa_v\\): Speed of mean reversion (how quickly volatility returns to its average)\n\\(\\sigma_v\\): Volatility of volatility (how much randomness in the volatility process)\n\nDiscretizing this model at daily or weekly intervals yields the discrete-time specification:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\ny_{t} &= \\mu + \\sqrt{v_{t-1}} \\varepsilon_{t}^{s}  \\\\\n\\log v_{t} &= \\alpha_{v} + \\beta_{v} \\log v_{t-1} + \\sigma_{v} \\varepsilon_{t}^{v}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(y_t = \\log(S_t/S_{t-1})\\) are log-returns, \\(\\varepsilon_{t}^{s}, \\varepsilon_{t}^{v} \\sim N(0,1)\\) are standard normal innovations, and the parameters relate to the continuous-time specification via \\(\\alpha_v = \\kappa_v \\theta_v \\Delta\\) and \\(\\beta_v = 1 - \\kappa_v \\Delta\\) for time interval \\(\\Delta\\).\nThis model exhibits several desirable features:\n\nVolatility clustering: Since \\(\\log v_t\\) follows an AR(1), periods of high volatility tend to persist\nStationarity: The mean-reverting specification ensures volatility doesn’t explode or collapse to zero\nFlexibility: The correlation between \\(\\varepsilon_t^s\\) and \\(\\varepsilon_t^v\\) allows for leverage effects\n\nAn important empirical regularity in equity markets is that volatility tends to increase when prices fall—a phenomenon known as the leverage effect. While originally attributed to changing debt-to-equity ratios as stock prices move, it is now understood as a more general feature of risk dynamics.\nTo incorporate the leverage effect, we allow the innovations in returns and volatility to be correlated:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\ny_{t} &= \\mu + \\sqrt{v_{t-1}} \\varepsilon_{t}^{s}  \\\\\n\\log v_{t} &= \\alpha_{v} + \\beta_{v} \\log v_{t-1} + \\sigma_{v}\\left[\\rho \\varepsilon_{t}^{s} + \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2} \\varepsilon_{t}^{v}\\right]\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(\\rho &lt; 0\\) for equity returns. A negative return shock (\\(\\varepsilon_t^s &lt; 0\\)) directly increases log-volatility through the \\(\\rho\\) term, generating the observed inverse relationship between prices and volatility.\nWhile stochastic volatility captures the time-varying nature of market uncertainty, it still relies on continuous Brownian motion for price movements. To accommodate the extreme events and heavy tails observed in returns, we augment the model with jump components—invoking the full Lévy-Itô decomposition.\nThe stochastic volatility with jumps (SVJ) model extends the basic SV specification by adding a Poisson-driven jump process to returns:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\ny_{t} &= \\mu + \\sqrt{v_{t-1}} \\varepsilon_{t}^{s} + J_t Z_t  \\\\\n\\log v_{t} &= \\alpha_{v} + \\beta_{v} \\log v_{t-1} + \\sigma_{v} \\varepsilon_{t}^{v}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(J_t \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(\\lambda)\\) indicates whether a jump occurs at time \\(t\\)\n\\(Z_t \\sim N(\\mu_Z, \\sigma_Z^2)\\) is the jump size when a jump occurs\n\\(\\lambda\\) is the jump intensity (probability of a jump per period)\n\nThe total variance of returns now decomposes into two sources:\n\\[\n\\text{Var}(y_t) = \\E{v_{t-1}} + \\lambda E[Z_t^2]\n\\]\nThe first term captures diffusive volatility from continuous fluctuations, while the second captures jump variance from discrete events. This allows the model to simultaneously fit the day-to-day variations (through \\(v_t\\)) and occasional crashes (through jumps).\nThe 2008 financial crisis revealed another important feature: volatility itself experiences sudden jumps. The VIX index (a measure of market volatility expectations) more than doubled in a matter of days during the Lehman Brothers collapse. To capture this, we extend the model to allow jumps in both returns and volatility.\nThe stochastic volatility with correlated jumps (SVCJ) model specifies:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\ny_{t} &= \\mu + \\sqrt{v_{t-1}} \\varepsilon_{t}^{s} + J_t Z_t  \\\\\nv_{t} &= \\alpha_{v} + \\beta_{v} v_{t-1} + \\sigma_{v}\\sqrt{v_{t-1}} \\varepsilon_{t}^{v} + J_t W_t\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere:\n\nThe same Bernoulli \\(J_t\\) triggers jumps in both returns and volatility (correlated jumps)\n\\(Z_t | W_t \\sim N(\\mu_Z + \\rho_J W_t, \\sigma_Z^2)\\) allows jump sizes to be correlated\n\\(W_t \\sim \\text{Exponential}(\\mu_W)\\) ensures volatility jumps are positive\n\nThe correlation parameter \\(\\rho_J &lt; 0\\) captures the empirical finding that large negative return jumps are typically accompanied by large positive volatility jumps. For example, during the March 2020 COVID-19 crash, the S&P 500 fell sharply while the VIX spiked to record levels.\nAn even more flexible specification, the stochastic volatility with independent jumps (SVIJ) model, allows jumps in returns and volatility to occur independently, governed by separate Poisson processes with intensities \\(\\lambda_Z\\) and \\(\\lambda_W\\). This provides maximum flexibility but requires more data to estimate reliably.\nTo understand the empirical importance of these model features, consider parameter estimates from S&P 500 daily returns (1980-1999):\n\n\n\nTable 7.7: Model features\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nSV\nSVJ\nSVCJ\nSVIJ\n\n\n\n\nStochastic volatility\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n\n\nReturn jumps\n–\n✓\n✓\n✓\n\n\nVolatility jumps\n–\n–\n✓\n✓\n\n\nIndependent jumps\n–\n–\n–\n✓\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe estimated average annualized volatility across models is remarkably stable (around 15%), closely matching the sample standard deviation of 16%. However, the decomposition of variance sources differs:\n\nSV model: All variation comes from the stochastic volatility component\nSVJ model: 85% from stochastic volatility, 15% from return jumps\nSVCJ model: 90% from stochastic volatility, 10% from return jumps\nSVIJ model: 92% from stochastic volatility, 8% from return jumps\n\nThe diminishing role of return jumps as we add volatility jumps reflects an important finding: much of what appears as “jumps in returns” in simpler models is actually driven by jumps in volatility. When volatility suddenly spikes, even Brownian motion can generate large price movements that might be misidentified as jumps.\nThe mean reversion parameter \\(\\kappa_v\\) also varies across specifications. In the SVCJ and SVIJ models, \\(\\kappa_v\\) roughly doubles compared to the SV model, indicating that volatility reverts more quickly when jumps account for sudden large moves. The volatility-of-volatility parameter \\(\\sigma_v\\) correspondingly falls, as jumps handle the extreme variations.\n\n\nBayesian Inference for Stochastic Volatility Models\nEstimating stochastic volatility models presents a significant challenge: the volatility \\(v_t\\) is never directly observed, appearing as a latent state variable. Classical maximum likelihood approaches require integrating out the entire volatility path, which is computationally intractable for nonlinear models with jumps.\nThe Bayesian approach via MCMC provides an elegant solution by treating the latent volatilities and jump indicators as parameters to be sampled alongside model parameters. The Clifford-Hammersley theorem structures the algorithm efficiently.\nFor the basic SV model with parameter vector \\(\\theta = (\\alpha_v, \\beta_v, \\sigma_v^2)\\) and latent volatilities \\(v = (v_1, \\ldots, v_T)\\), the joint posterior factors as:\n\\[\np(\\theta, v | y) \\propto p(y | v) p(v | \\theta) p(\\theta)\n\\]\nThe MCMC algorithm alternates between:\n\nParameter update: \\(p(\\theta | v, y)\\)\n\nGiven volatilities, returns are conditionally normal: \\(y_t | v_{t-1} \\sim N(\\mu, v_{t-1})\\)\nLog-volatilities follow AR(1): \\(\\log v_t | \\log v_{t-1} \\sim N(\\alpha_v + \\beta_v \\log v_{t-1}, \\sigma_v^2)\\)\nWith conjugate priors, conditional posteriors are standard (Normal-Inverse-Gamma)\n\nVolatility update: \\(p(v_t | v_{t-1}, v_{t+1}, \\theta, y)\\)\n\nThe conditional posterior for each \\(v_t\\) combines information from:\n\nThe likelihood \\(p(y_{t+1} | v_t)\\) (observed return depends on current volatility)\nThe state evolution \\(p(v_t | v_{t-1})\\) (Markov dynamics from previous period)\nThe forward evolution \\(p(v_{t+1} | v_t)\\) (Markov dynamics to next period)\n\nThis distribution is non-standard and requires Metropolis-Hastings sampling\n\n\nFor the jump-augmented models (SVJ, SVCJ, SVIJ), we additionally sample:\n\nJump indicators: \\(p(J_t | v, Z, \\theta, y)\\)\n\nEach \\(J_t \\in \\{0,1\\}\\) follows a Bernoulli posterior\nLarge observed returns increase the probability of \\(J_t = 1\\)\n\nJump sizes: \\(p(Z_t | J_t = 1, v, \\theta, y)\\)\n\nConditional on a jump occurring, the jump size has a Normal posterior\nThe posterior mean balances the jump prior and the size needed to explain the observed return\n\n\nThis modular structure allows us to build up from simpler models (SV) to more complex specifications (SVIJ) by adding components one at a time, reusing the same basic algorithmic building blocks.\nStochastic volatility models with jumps have become standard tools in quantitative finance for several applications:\nOption Pricing: The Black-Scholes model systematically misprices options, particularly out-of-the-money puts. The volatility smile—the observation that implied volatilities increase for strikes far from the current price—reflects the market’s recognition of jump risk and stochastic volatility. Jump-diffusion models with stochastic volatility can reproduce these patterns, providing more accurate prices and hedging strategies.\nRisk Management: Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall calculations based on constant-volatility Gaussian models dramatically underestimate tail risks. By properly accounting for stochastic volatility and jumps, firms can better quantify their exposure to extreme market movements. During the 2008 crisis, many institutions discovered their VaR models had severely underestimated potential losses.\nPortfolio Allocation: The presence of stochastic volatility creates hedging demands even for long-horizon investors. An investor who correctly anticipates that volatility is mean-reverting will reduce equity exposure when volatility is high (because expected returns are temporarily compressed) and increase exposure when volatility is low. This generates countercyclical trading strategies.\nMarket Timing: The predictable component of volatility can be exploited for tactical asset allocation. Since volatility tends to mean-revert, unusually high volatility signals elevated future returns (as compensation for risk), making it an opportune time to increase risky asset exposure. Conversely, unusually low volatility may warrant defensive positioning.\nThe integration of Brownian motion and Poisson processes through stochastic volatility models exemplifies how the Lévy-Itô decomposition provides not just mathematical elegance, but practical power for understanding and managing financial risk in modern markets.\n\n\n\n\nA.

    "text": "8.1 Making Predictions with Gaussian Processes\nA Gaussian Process (GP) is a collection of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint Gaussian distribution. It is a powerful tool for modelling and prediction in many fields and is particularly useful for regression and classification tasks in machine learning. A finite collection of \\(n\\) points drawn from a Gaussian Process is completely specified by its \\(n\\)-dimensional mean vector \\(\\mu\\) and covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\). In what follows we assume the process is indexed by a real variable \\(x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) and has real-valued outputs. The mean of the process (and a finite collection of points) is defined by function \\(m(x)\\) and covariance is defined by function \\(k(x, x')\\), where \\(x\\) and \\(x'\\) are points in the index space.\nThe mean function defines the average value of the function at point \\(x\\), and the covariance function, also known as the kernel, defines the extent to which the values of the function at two points \\(x\\) and \\(x'\\) are correlated. In other words, the kernel function is a measure of similarity between two input points. The covariance between two points is higher if they are similar, and lower if they are dissimilar. Thus a Gaussian Process is completely specified by its mean function and covariance function, and an instance of a one-dimensional GP is a function \\(f(x): \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\). The typical notation is \\[\nf(x) \\sim \\mathcal{GP}(m(x), k(x, x')).\n\\] The mean function \\(m(x) = \\mathbb{E}[f(x)]\\) represents the expected value of the function at point \\(x\\), and the covariance function \\(k(x, x') = \\mathbb{E}[(f(x) - m(x))(f(x') - m(x'))]\\) describes the amount of dependence between the values of the function at two different points in the input space.\nIn practice, the mean function is often less important than the covariance function. It is common to assume a zero mean, \\(m(x)=0\\), and concentrate on specifying an appropriate covariance kernel. The kernel function is often chosen to be a function of the distance between the two points \\(|x-x'|\\) or \\(\\|x-x'\\|_2\\) in higher dimensions. The most commonly used kernel function is the squared exponential kernel, which is a function of the squared distance between the two points. The squared exponential kernel is given by: \\[\nk(x, x') = \\sigma^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - x')^2}{2l^2}\\right)\n\\] where \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the variance parameter and \\(l\\) is the length scale parameter. The variance parameter controls the vertical variation of the function (its amplitude), whereas the length-scale parameter governs horizontal variation (the number and width of “bumps”). The length scale parameter determines how far apart two points must be to be considered dissimilar. The larger the length scale, the smoother the function. The length scale parameter is also called the bandwidth parameter. In this case the covariance decays exponentially with the distance between the points. Observe, that \\(k(x,x) = \\sigma^2\\) and \\(k(x,x') \\rightarrow 0\\) as \\(|x-x'| \\rightarrow \\infty\\).\nWe can illustrate a GP with a simulated example. First generate a sequence of 100 input points (indices)\nand then define the mean function and the covariance function\nThe covariance function depends only on the distance between two points, not on their absolute values. The squared exponential kernel is infinitely differentiable, which means that the GP is a very smooth function. The squared exponential kernel is also called the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. The covariance matrix is then defined as\nand we can generate a sample from the GP using the mvrnorm function from the MASS package and plot a sample\nFigure 8.1 displays 100 values of a function \\(f(x)\\) drawn from a GP with zero mean and a squared-exponential kernel at inputs \\(x=(0,0.1,0.2,\\ldots,10)\\). The realisation is smooth, with most values lying between -2 and 2. Because each diagonal element of the covariance matrix equals \\(\\sigma^2=1\\), the marginal variance is one. By properties of the normal distribution, approximately 95 percent of the points of \\(Y\\) should therefore fall within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. The mild oscillations arise because values with neighbouring indices are highly correlated.\nWe can generate a few more samples from the same GP and plot them together\nEach finite sample path differs from the next, yet all share a similar range, a comparable number of bumps, and overall smoothness. That’s what it means to have function realizations under a GP prior: \\(Y = f(x) \\sim \\mathcal{GP}(0, k(x, x'))\\)\nSuppose our observed data, consisting of inputs \\(X=(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) and outputs \\(Y=(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)\\), are a realisation of a GP. We can then use the GP to predict the outputs at new inputs \\(x_* \\in \\mathbb{R}^q\\). The joint distribution of the observed data \\(Y\\) and the new data \\(y_*\\) is given by \\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} Y \\\\ y_* \\end{bmatrix} \\sim \\mathcal{N} \\left ( \\begin{bmatrix} \\mu \\\\ \\mu_* \\end{bmatrix}, \\begin{bmatrix} K & K_* \\\\ K_*^T & K_{**} \\end{bmatrix} \\right )\n\\] where \\(K = k(X, X)\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}\\), \\(K_* = k(X, x_*)\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times q}\\), \\(K_{**} = k(x_*, x_*) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{q\\times q}\\), \\(\\mu = \\mathbb{E}[Y]\\), and \\(\\mu_* = \\mathbb{E}[y_*]\\). The conditional distribution of \\(y_*\\) given \\(y\\) is then given by \\[\ny_* \\mid Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{post}}, \\Sigma_{\\mathrm{post}}).\n\\] The mean of the conditional distribution is given by \\[\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{post}} = \\mu_* + K_*^TK^{-1} (Y - \\mu)\n\\tag{8.1}\\] and the covariance is given by \\[\n\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{post}} = K_{**} - K_*^T K^{-1} K_*.\n\\tag{8.2}\\]\nEquation 8.1 and Equation 8.2 are convenient properties of a multivariate normal distribution.\nNow, instead of using GP to fit a known function (\\(\\sin\\)), we will apply it to a real-world data set. We will use the motorcycle accident data set from the MASS package. The data set contains accelerator readings taken through time in a simulated experiment on the efficacy of crash helmets.\nIn summary, Gaussian Processes provide a robust and flexible framework for modeling and predicting in situations where uncertainty and correlation among data points play a critical role. Their versatility and powerful predictive capabilities make them a popular choice in various scientific and engineering disciplines. GPs are considered non-parametric, which means they can model functions of arbitrary complexity. Through the choice of the kernel function, GPs can model a wide range of correlations between the data points. The mean and covariance functions can incorporate prior knowledge about the behavior of the function being modeled. There are many areas of applications for GP. The main applications include predictive modeling, optimization, and uncertainty quantification. We will focus on the first two applications in the later sections. In predictive modeling we can use GPs to predict the value of a function at new points, taking into account the uncertainty of the prediction. GPs are particularly useful in spatial data analysis, where the correlation between data points is often related to their physical distance. Thus, GPs are quite often used for environmental modeling to analyze temperature or pollution levels over geographical areas.",

    "text": "Example 8.1 (Gaussian Process for \\(\\sin\\) function) We can use the GP to make predictions about the output values at new inputs \\(x_*\\). We use \\(x\\) in the [0,\\(2\\pi\\)] range and \\(y\\) to be the \\(y = \\sin(x)\\). We start by simulating the observed \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) pairs.\n\nn = 8; eps=1e-6\nX = matrix(seq(0, 2*pi, length=n), ncol=1)\nY = sin(X)\nK = outer(X[,1], X[,1], sqexpcov) + diag(eps, n)\n\nThe additive term diag(eps, n) \\(=\\epsilon I\\) adds a diagonal matrix with the small \\(\\epsilon\\) on the diagonal. This addition shifts the spectrum of \\(K\\) slightly and prevents eigenvalues from being exactly zero, ensuring that inverting or solving linear systems involving \\(K\\) remains numerically stable. In machine learning, this term is called jitter. Now we implement a function that calculates the mean and covariance of the posterior distribution of \\(y_*\\) given \\(Y\\).\nNow we generate a new set of inputs \\(x_*\\) and calculate the covariance matrices \\(K_*\\) and \\(K_{**}\\).\n\nq = 100\nXX = matrix(seq(-0.5, 2*pi + 0.5, length=q), ncol=1)\nKX = outer(X[,1], XX[,1],sqexpcov)\nKXX = outer(XX[,1],XX[,1], sqexpcov) + diag(eps, q)\n\nNotice that we did not add \\(\\epsilon I\\) to \\(K_*\\) = KX matrix, but we add it to \\(K_{**}\\) = KXX to guarantee that the resulting posterior covariance matrix is non-singular (invertible).

However, we can use the observed data to estimate those two parameters. In the context of GP models, they are called hyperparameters. We will use Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) procedure to estimate those hyperparameters. The likelihood of data that follows a multivariate normal distribution is given by \\[\np(Y \\mid X, \\sigma, l) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{n/2} |K|^{1/2}} \\exp \\left ( -\\frac{1}{2} Y^T K^{-1} Y \\right )\n\\] where \\(K = K(X,X)\\) is the covariance matrix. We assume the mean is zero, to simplify the formulas. The log-likelihood is given by \\[\n\\log p(Y \\mid X, \\sigma, l) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\log |K| - \\frac{1}{2} Y^T K^{-1} Y - \\frac{n}{2} \\log 2\\pi.\n\\]\nWe can implement a function that calculates the log-likelihood of the data given the hyperparameters \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(l\\) and use optim function to find the maximum of the log-likelihood function.\n\nloglik = function(par, X, Y) {\n  sigma = par[1]\n  l = par[2]\n  K = outer(X[,1],X[,1], sqexpcov,l,sigma) + diag(eps, n)\n  Si = solve(K)\n  return(-(-0.5 * log(det(K)) - 0.5 * t(Y) %*% Si %*% Y - (n/2)* log(2*pi)))\n}\npar = optim(c(1,1), loglik, X=X, Y=Y)$par\nprint(par)\n\n 1.5 2.4\n\n\nThe optim function returns the hyperparameters that maximize the log-likelihood function. We can now use those hyperparameters to make predictions about the output values at new inputs \\(x_*\\).\n\nl = par[2]; sigma = par[1]\npredplot = function(X, Y, XX, YY, l, sigma) {\n  K = outer(X[,1],X[,1], sqexpcov,l,sigma) + diag(eps, n)\n  KX = outer(X[,1], XX[,1],sqexpcov,l,sigma)\n  KXX = outer(XX[,1],XX[,1], sqexpcov,l,sigma) + diag(eps, q)\n  Si = solve(K)\n  mup = t(KX) %*% Si %*% Y # we assume mu is 0\n  Sigmap = KXX - t(KX) %*% Si %*% KX\n  YY = mvrnorm(100, mup, Sigmap)\n  plot_gp(mup, Sigmap, X, Y, XX, YY)\n}\npredplot(X, Y, XX, YY, l, sigma)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that our uncertainty is much narrower—the posterior distribution is considerably tighter. This is because we used the observed data to estimate the hyperparameters. We can also see that the posterior mean is closer to the true function \\(y = \\sin(x)\\). Although our initial guess of \\(\\sigma^2 = 1\\) and \\(2l^2 = 1\\) was not too far off, the model fits the data much better when we use the estimated hyperparameters.\nThe function optim we used above uses a derivative-based optimization algorithm and when derivative is not provided by the user, it uses a numerical approximation. Although we can use numerical methods to calculate the derivative of the log-likelihood function, it is faster and more accurate to use analytical derivatives, when possible. In the case of the GP’s log-likelihood, the derivative can be analytically calculated. To do it, we need a couple of facts from matrix calculus. If elements of matrix \\(K\\) are functions of some parameter \\(\\theta\\), then \\[\n\\frac{\\partial  Y^T K^{-1} Y}{\\partial \\theta} =  Y^T \\frac{\\partial K^{-1}}{\\partial \\theta} Y.\n\\] The derivative of the inverse matrix \\[\n\\frac{\\partial K^{-1}}{\\partial \\theta} = -K^{-1} \\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial \\theta} K^{-1}.\n\\] and the log of the determinant of a matrix \\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\log |K|}{\\partial \\theta} = \\mathrm{tr} \\left ( K^{-1} \\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial \\theta} \\right ),\n\\] we can calculate the derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to \\(\\theta\\) \\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\log p(Y \\mid X,\\theta)}{\\partial \\theta} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial \\log |K|}{\\partial \\theta}  + \\frac{1}{2} Y^T \\frac{\\partial K^{-1}}{\\partial \\theta}  Y.\n\\] Putting it all together, we get \\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\log p(Y \\mid X,\\theta)}{\\partial \\theta} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{tr} \\left ( K^{-1} \\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial \\theta} \\right ) + \\frac{1}{2} Y^T K^{-1} \\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial \\theta} K^{-1} Y.\n\\] In the case of squared exponential kernel, the elements of the covariance matrix \\(K\\) are given by \\[\nK_{ij} = k(x_i, x_j) = \\sigma^2 \\exp \\left ( -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(x_i - x_j)^2}{l^2} \\right ).\n\\] The derivative of the covariance matrix with respect to \\(\\sigma\\) is given by \\[\n\\frac{\\partial K_{ij}}{\\partial \\sigma} = 2\\sigma \\exp \\left ( -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(x_i - x_j)^2}{l^2} \\right );~\\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial \\sigma} = \\dfrac{2}{\\sigma}K.\n\\] The derivative of the covariance matrix with respect to \\(l\\) is given by \\[\n\\frac{\\partial K_{ij}}{\\partial l} = \\sigma^2 \\exp \\left ( -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(x_i - x_j)^2}{l^2} \\right ) \\frac{(x_i - x_j)^2}{l^3};~ \\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial l}  = \\frac{(x_i - x_j)^2}{l^3} K.\n\\] Now we can implement a function that calculates the derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(l\\).\n\n# Derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to sigma\ndloglik_sigma = function(par, X, Y) {\n  sigma = par[1]; l = par[2]\n  K = outer(X[,1],X[,1], sqexpcov,l,sigma) + diag(eps, n)\n  Si = solve(K)\n  dK = 2*K/sigma\n  tr = sum(diag(Si %*% dK))\n  return(-(-0.5 * tr + 0.5 * t(Y) %*% Si %*% dK %*% Si %*% Y))\n}\n# Derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to l\ndloglik_l = function(par, X, Y) {\n  sigma = par[1]; l = par[2]\n  K = outer(X[,1],X[,1], sqexpcov ,l,sigma) + diag(eps, n)\n  Si = solve(K)\n  dK =   outer(X[,1],X[,1], function(x, x1) (x - x1)^2)/l^3 * K\n  tr = sum(diag(Si %*% dK))\n  return(-(-0.5 * tr + 0.5 * t(Y) %*% Si %*% dK %*% Si %*% Y))\n}\n# Gradient function that returns a vector of derivatives\ngnlg = function(par,X,Y) {\n  return(c(dloglik_sigma(par, X, Y), dloglik_l(par, X, Y)))\n}\n\nNow we can use the optim function to find the maximum of the log-likelihood function and provide the derivative function we just implemented.\n\npar1 = optim(c(1,1), fn=loglik, gr=gnlg ,X=X, Y=Y,method=\"BFGS\")$par\nl = par1[2]; sigma = par1[1]\nprint(par1)\n\n 1.5 2.4\n\n\nThe result is the same compared to when we called optim without the derivative function. Even execution time is the same for our small problem. However, at larger scale, the derivative-based optimization algorithm will be much faster.\nFurthermore, instead of coding our own derivative functions, we can use an existing package, such as the laGP package, developed by Bobby Gramacy to estimate the hyperparameters. The laGP package uses the same optimization algorithm we used above, but it also provides better selection of the covariance functions and implements approximate GP inference algorithms for large scale problems, when \\(n\\) becomes large and inversion of the covariance matrix \\(K\\) is prohibitively expensive.\n\nlibrary(laGP)\ngp = newGP(X, Y, 1, 0, dK = TRUE)\nres = mleGP(gp, tmax=20)\nl.laGP = sqrt(res$d/2)\nprint(l.laGP)\n\n 2.4\n\n\nIn the newGP function defines a Gaussian process with square exponential covariance function and assumes \\(\\sigma^2 = 1\\), then mleGP function uses optimization algorithm to maximize the log-likelihood and returns the estimated hyperparameters d = \\(2l^2\\), we can see that the length scale is close to the one we estimated above. We will use the predplot convenience function to calculate the predictions and plot the data vs fit.\npredplot(X, Y, XX, YY, l, sigma)\npredplot(X, Y, XX, YY, l.laGP, 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) MLE Fit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) laGP Fit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: Posterior distribution over \\(y_*\\), given \\(Y\\)\n\n\n\nWe can see that there is visually no difference between the two fits. Thus, it seems irrelevant whether we keep sigma fixed \\(\\sigma=1\\) or estimate it using MLE. However, in other applications when uncertainty is larger, the choice of \\(\\sigma\\) is important when we use GP for regression and classification tasks. Even for our example, if we ask our model to extrapolate\nXX1 = matrix(seq(-4*pi, 6*pi + 0.5, length=q), ncol=1)\npredplot(X, Y, XX1, YY, l, sigma)\npredplot(X, Y, XX1, YY, l.laGP, 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMLE Fit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlaGP Fit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtrapolation: Posterior distribution over \\(y_*\\), given \\(Y\\)\n\n\n\nWe can see that outside of the range of the observed data, the model with \\(\\sigma=1\\) is more confident in its predictions.\n\n\n\nExample 8.3 (Gaussian Process for Motorcycle Accident Data) We first estimate the length scale parameter \\(l\\) using the laGP package.\n\nlibrary(MASS)\nX = mcycle$times\nY = mcycle$accel\ngp = newGP(matrix(X), Y, 2, 1e-6, dK = TRUE);\nmleGP(gp, tmax=10);\n\nNow we plot the data and the fit using the estimated length scale parameter \\(l\\).\n\nXX = matrix(seq(2.4, 55, length = 499), ncol=1)\np = predGP(gp, XX)\nN = 499\nq1 = qnorm(0.05, mean = p$mean, sd = sqrt(diag(p$Sigma)))\nq2 = qnorm(0.95, mean = p$mean, sd = sqrt(diag(p$Sigma)))\nq3 = qnorm(0.5, mean = p$mean, sd = sqrt(diag(p$Sigma)))\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(aes(x=X,y=Y)) + \n  geom_line(aes(x=XX,y=q3)) + \n  geom_ribbon(aes(x=XX,ymin=q1, ymax=q2), alpha=0.2)\n\n\n\n\nMotorcycle Accident Data.

The confidence interval is wider for time values between 0 and 10 and between 30 and 60, and less confident at the end close to the 60 mark. For some reason the acceleration values were not measured evenly.

    "text": "9.1 Multi-Armed Bandits\n“Information is the resolution of uncertainty.” Claude Shannon, 1948\nThus far we have discussed making decisions under uncertainty (Chapter 4 and Chapter 5) and two modes of data collection: field experiments and observational studies. In a field experiment we control the data‐generation process before the study begins, whereas in an observational study we have no such control and must work with whatever data are produced.\nWhat if we can choose which data to collect while the experiment is running? This leads to sequential (or adaptive) experimental design, in which each new observation is selected on the basis of the data gathered so far, creating a feedback loop between data generation and decision-making. The idea is illustrated in the following diagram:\nThere are multiple applications where this general framework can be applied and multiple algorithms that implement this concept. In this section, we will consider the most widely used among them:\nOne of the first practical demonstrations of reinforcement learning (then called trial-and-error learning) was Claude Shannon’s 1950s mechanical mouse Theseus, which learned to find its way through a maze.\nWhen the number of alternatives is large and the testing budget limited, a different approach to A/B testing —- the multi-armed bandit (MAB) can be more sample-efficient. Although the mathematical analysis and design of the experiments is slightly more complicated, the idea is simple. Instead of testing all alternatives at the same time, we test them sequentially. We start with a small number of alternatives and collect data. Based on the data we decide which alternative to test next. This way we can test more alternatives with the same number of samples. Thus, MABs allow us to explore and exploit simultaneously. MABs require that the outcome of each experiment is available immediately or with small enough delay to make a decision on the next experiment (Scott 2015). On the other hand, MABs are more sample efficient and allow us to find an optimal alternative faster. Thus, in the case when time is of the essence and there is an opportunity cost associated with delaying the decision, MABs are a better choice.\nFormally, there are \\(K\\) alternatives (arms) and each arm \\(a\\) is associated with a reward distribution \\(v_a\\), the value of this arm. The goal is to find the arm with the highest expected reward and accumulate the highest total reward in doing so. The reward distribution is unknown and we can only observe the reward after we select an arm \\(a\\) but we assume that we know the distribution \\(f_a(y\\mid \\theta)\\), where \\(a\\) is the arm index, \\(y\\) is the reward, and \\(\\theta\\) is the set of unknown parameters to be learned. The value of arm \\(v_a(\\theta)\\) is known, given \\(\\theta\\). Here are a few examples:\nA variation of the second example would include controlling for background variables, meaning adding covariates that correspond to variables that are not under our control. For example, we might want to control for the time of the day or the user’s location. This would allow us to estimate the effect of the design variables while controlling for the background variables. Another variation is to replace the binary outcome variable with a continuous variable, such as the time spent on the website or the amount of money spent on the website or count variable. In this case we simply use linear regression or another appropriate generalized linear model. Although at any given time, we might have our best guess about the values of parameters \\(\\hat \\theta\\), acting in a greedy way and choosing the arm with the highest expected reward \\(\\hat a = \\arg\\max_a v_a(\\hat \\theta)\\), we might be missing out on a better alternative. The problem is that we are not sure about our estimates \\(\\hat \\theta\\) and we need to explore other alternatives. Thus, we need to balance exploration and exploitation. A widely used and oldest approach for managing the explore/exploit trade-off in a multi-armed bandit problem is Thompson sampling. The idea is to use Bayesian inference to estimate the posterior distribution of the parameters \\(\\theta\\) and then sample from this distribution to select the next arm to test. The algorithm is as follows.\nAs the algorithm progresses, the posterior distributions of the arms are updated based on observed data, and arms with higher estimated success probabilities are favored for selection. Over time, Thompson Sampling adapts its beliefs and preferences, leading to better exploration and exploitation of arms.\nIt’s important to note that the effectiveness of Thompson Sampling depends on the choice of prior distributions and the updating process. The algorithm’s Bayesian nature allows it to naturally incorporate uncertainty and make informed decisions in the presence of incomplete information. The initial priors \\((\\alpha_i, \\beta_i)\\) can be set based on any available information about the arms, or as uniform distributions if no prior knowledge exists. This is a basic implementation of Thompson sampling. Variations exist for handling continuous rewards, incorporating side information, and adapting to non-stationary environments.",

    "text": "In online advertisements, we have \\(K\\) possible ads to be shown and probability of user clicking is given by vector \\(\\theta = (\\theta_1,\\ldots,\\theta_K)\\) of success probabilities for \\(K\\) independent binomial models, with \\(v_a(\\theta) = \\theta_a\\). The goal is to find the ad with the highest click-through rate.\nIn website design, we have two design variables, the color of a button (red or blue) and its pixel size (27 or 40), we introduce two dummy variables \\(x_c\\) for color, \\(x_s\\) for size and the probability of user clicking is given by \\[\n\\mathrm{logit} P(\\text{click} \\mid \\theta) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_x x_c + \\theta_s x_s + \\theta_{cs}x_cx_s,\n\\] with \\(v_a(\\theta) = P(\\text{click} \\mid \\theta)\\).\n\n\n\nInitial Beliefs. For each arm \\(k\\) (\\(k = 1,\\ldots,K\\)), define a prior belief about its reward distribution using a beta distribution with parameters \\(\\alpha_i\\) and \\(\\beta_i\\). These parameters represent the prior knowledge about the number of successes (\\(\\alpha_k\\)) and failures (\\(\\beta_k\\)) experienced with arm \\(k\\).\n\nSampling Parameters. For each arm \\(k\\), sample a reward \\[\n\\hat \\theta_k \\sim Beta(\\alpha_k, \\beta_k)\n\\]\nfrom the beta distribution. This simulates drawing a potential reward from the unknown true distribution of arm \\(i\\). A suboptimal greedy alternative is to select expected value of the parameter \\(\\hat \\theta_k = E(\\theta_k) =\\alpha_k/(\\alpha_k + \\beta_k)\\).\n\nChoosing the Best Arm. Select the arm \\(k\\) with the highest sampled reward \\(\\hat \\theta_k\\): \\[\na_t = \\arg\\max_i \\hat \\theta_k.\n\\]\nUpdating Beliefs. After observing the actual reward \\(R_t\\) for the chosen arm \\(a_t\\), update the parameters for that arm: \\[\n\\alpha_i = \\alpha_i + R_t, \\quad \\beta_i = \\beta_i + (1 - R_t)\n\\] This update incorporates the new information gained from the actual reward into the belief about arm \\(a_t\\)’s distribution.\nRepeat. Go back to step 2 and continue sampling, choosing, and updating until you reach a stopping point.\n\n\n\n\nWhen to End Experiments\nStep 2 of the TS algorithm can be replaced by calculating probability of an arm \\(a\\) being the best \\(w_{at}\\) and then choose the arm by sampling from the discrete distribution \\(w_{1t},\\ldots,w_{Kt}\\). The probability of an arm \\(a\\) being the best is given by \\[\nw_{at} = P(a \\text{ is optimal } \\mid y^t) = \\int P(a \\text{ is optimal } \\mid \\theta) P(\\theta \\mid y^t) d\\theta,\n\\] where \\(y^t = (y_1,\\ldots,y_t)\\) is the history of observations up to time \\(t\\). We can calculate the probabilities \\(w_{at}\\) using Monte Carlo. We can sample \\(\\theta^{(1)},\\ldots,\\theta^{(G)}\\) from the posterior distribution \\(p(\\theta \\mid y^t)\\) and calculate the probability as \\[\nw_{at}\\approx \\dfrac{1}{G}\\sum_{g=1}^G I(a = \\arg\\max_i v_i(\\theta^{(g)})),\n\\] where \\(I(\\cdot)\\) is the indicator function. This is simply the proportion of times the arm was the best in the \\(G\\) samples.\nAlthough using a single draw from posterior \\(p(\\theta \\mid y^t)\\) (as in the original algorithm) is equivalent to sampling proportional to \\(w_{at}\\), the explicitly calculated \\(w_{at}\\) yields a useful statistic that can be used to decide on when to end the experiment.\nWe will use the regret statistic to decide when to stop. Regret is the difference in values between the truly optimal arm and the arm that is apparently optimal at time \\(t\\). Although we cannot know the regret (it is unobservable), we can compute samples from its posterior distribution. We simulate the posterior distribution of the regret by sampling \\(\\theta^{(1)},\\ldots,\\theta^{(G)}\\) from the posterior distribution \\(p(\\theta \\mid y^t)\\) and calculating the regret as \\[\nr^{(g)} =  (v_a^*(\\theta^{(g)}) - v_{a^*_t}(\\theta^{(g)})),\n\\] Here \\(a^*\\) is the arm deemed best across all Monte Carlo draws and the first term is the value of the best arm within draw \\(g\\). We choose \\(a^*_t\\) as \\[\na^*_t = \\arg\\max_a w_{at}.\n\\]\nOften, it is convenient to measure the regret on the percent scale and then we use \\[\nr^{(g)} \\leftarrow r^{(g)}/v_{a^*_t}(\\theta^{(g)})\n\\]\nWe can demonstrate using simulated data. The function below generates samples \\(\\theta^{(g)}\\)\n\nbandit = function(x,n,alpha = 1,beta = 1,ndraws = 5000) {\n  set.seed(17) # Kharlamov\n  K &lt;- length(x) # number of bandits\n  prob &lt;- matrix(nrow = ndraws,ncol = K)\n  no = n - x\n  for (a in 1:K) {# posterior draws for each arm\n    prob[, a] = rbeta(ndraws,x[a] + alpha,no[a] + beta)\n  }\n  prob\n}\n\nSay we have three arms with 20, 30, and 40 sessions that have generated 12, 20, and 30 conversions.

The 95th percentile of the value distribution is the potential value remaining (CvR) in the experiment, which in this case works out to be about 16%.\n\nquantile(regret,0.95)\n\n 95% \n0.17 \n\n\nYou interpret this number as “We’re still unsure about the CvR for arm 3, but whatever it is, one of the other arms might beat it by as much as 16%.”\nGoogle Analytics, for example, “ends the experiment when there’s at least a 95% probability that the value remaining in the experiment is less than 1% of the champion’s conversion rate. That’s a 1% improvement, not a one percentage point improvement. So if the best arm has a conversion rate of 4%, then we end the experiment if the value remaining in the experiment is less than .04 percentage points of CvR”.\n\n\nContextual Bandits\nTraditional multi-armed bandit models, like the binomial model, assume independent observations with fixed reward probabilities. This works well when rewards are consistent across different groups and times. However, for situations with diverse user bases or fluctuating activity patterns, such as international audiences or browsing behavior, this assumption can be misleading.\nFor instance, companies with a global web presence may experience temporal effects as markets in Asia, Europe, and the Americas become active at different times of the day. Additionally, user behavior can change based on the day of the week, with people engaging in different browsing patterns and purchase behaviors. For example, individuals may research expensive purchases during work hours but make actual purchases on weekends.\nConsider an experiment with two arms, A and B. Arm A performs slightly better during the weekdays when users browse but don’t make purchases, while Arm B excels during the weekends when users are more likely to make purchases. If there is a substantial amount of traffic, the binomial model might prematurely conclude that Arm A is the superior option before any weekend traffic is observed. This risk exists regardless of whether the experiment is conducted as a bandit or a traditional experiment. However, bandit experiments are more susceptible to this issue because they typically run for shorter durations.\nTo mitigate the risk of being misled by distinct sub-populations, two methods can be employed. If the specific sub-populations are known in advance or if there is a proxy for them, such as geographically induced temporal patterns, the binomial model can be adapted to a logistic regression model. This modification allows for a more nuanced understanding of the impact of different factors on arm performance, helping to account for variations in sub-population behavior and temporal effects. \\[\n\\mathrm{logit} P(\\text{click}_a \\mid \\theta, x) = \\theta_{0a} + \\beta^Tx,\n\\] where \\(x\\) describes the circumstances or context of the observation. The success probability for selecting arm \\(a\\) under the context \\(x\\) is represented as \\(P(\\text{click}_a \\mid \\theta, x)\\). Each arm \\(a\\) has its own specific coefficient denoted as \\(\\beta_{0a}\\) with one arm’s coefficient set to zero as a reference point. Additionally, there is another set of coefficients represented as \\(\\beta\\) that are associated with the contextual data and are learned as part of the model. The value function can then be \\[\nv_a(\\theta) = \\mathrm{logit}^{-1}(\\beta_{0a}).\n\\]\nIf we lack knowledge about the crucial contexts, one option is to make the assumption that contexts are generated randomly from a context distribution. This approach is often exemplified by the use of a hierarchical model like the beta-binomial model. \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\theta_{at} &\\sim Beta(\\alpha_a,\\beta_a)\\\\\n\\text{click}_a \\mid \\theta &\\sim Binomial(\\theta_{at}),\n\\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\theta = \\{\\alpha_a,\\beta_a ~:~ a = 1,\\ldots,K \\}\\), with value function \\(v_a(\\theta) = \\alpha_a/\\beta_a\\)\n\n\nSummary of MAB Experimentation\nThe design phase begins with defining your arms by identifying the different options you want to evaluate, such as different website layouts, pricing strategies, or marketing campaigns. Next, choose a bandit algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation in various ways. Popular choices include Epsilon-greedy, Thompson Sampling, and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB). Then set your parameters by configuring the algorithm parameters based on your priorities and expected uncertainty. For example, a higher exploration rate encourages trying new arms earlier. Finally, randomize allocation by assigning users to arms randomly, ensuring unbiased data collection.\nDuring the analysis phase, track rewards by defining and measuring the reward metric for each arm, such as clicks, conversions, or profit. Monitor performance by regularly analyzing the cumulative reward and arm selection probabilities to see which arms are performing well and how the allocation strategy is adapting. Use statistical tools like confidence intervals or Bayesian methods to compare performance between arms and assess the significance of findings. Make adaptive adjustments by modifying the experiment based on ongoing analysis. You might adjust algorithm parameters, stop arms with demonstrably poor performance, or introduce new arms.\nStart with a small pool of arms to avoid information overload by testing a manageable number of options initially. Set a clear stopping criterion by deciding when to end the experiment based on a predetermined budget, time limit, or desired level of confidence in the results. Consider ethical considerations by ensuring user privacy and informed consent if the experiment involves personal data or user experience changes. Interpret results in context by remembering that MAB results are specific to the tested conditions and might not generalize perfectly to other contexts.\nBy following these steps and utilizing available resources, you can design and analyze effective MAB experiments to optimize your decision-making in various scenarios. Remember to adapt your approach based on your specific goals and context to maximize the benefits of this powerful technique.",

    "text": "9.2 Bellman Principle of Optimality\n\n“An optimum policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are, the remaining decision sequence must be optimum for the state resulting from the first decision.” – Richard Bellman\n\n\nExample 9.1 (Secretary Problem) The Secretary Problem, also known as the marriage problem or sultan’s dowry problem, is a classic problem in decision theory and probability theory. The scenario involves making a decision on selecting the best option from a sequence of candidates or options. The problem is often framed as hiring a secretary, but it can be applied to various situations such as choosing a house, a spouse, or any other scenario where you sequentially evaluate options and must make a decision.\nIn this problem, you receive \\(T\\) offers and must either accept or reject the offer “on the spot”. You cannot return to a previous offer once you have moved on to the next one. Offers are in random order and can be ranked against those previously seen. The aim is to maximize the probability of choosing the offer with the greatest rank. There is an optimal \\(r\\) (\\(1 \\le r &lt; T\\)) to be determined such that we examine and reject the first \\(r\\) offers. Then of the remaining \\(T - r\\) offers we choose the first one that is best seen to date.\nA decision strategy involves setting a threshold such that the first candidate above this threshold is hired, and all candidates below the threshold are rejected. The optimal strategy, known as the 37% rule, suggests that one should reject the first \\(r=T/e\\) candidates and then select the first candidate who is better than all those seen so far.\nThe reasoning behind the 37% rule is based on the idea of balancing exploration and exploitation. By rejecting the first \\(T/e\\) candidates, you gain a sense of the quality of the candidates but avoid committing too early. After that point, you select the first candidate who is better than the best among the initial \\(r\\) candidates.\nIt’s important to note that the 37% rule provides a probabilistic guarantee of selecting the best candidate with a probability close to 1/e (approximately 37%) as \\(T\\) becomes large.\nTo solve the secretary problem, we will use the principle of optimality due to Richard Bellman. The principle states that an optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are, the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with regard to the state resulting from the first decision. In other words, the policy is optimal from the first decision onwards.\nThe solution to the secretary problem can be found via dynamic programming. Given an agent with utility function \\(u(x,d)\\), with current state \\(x\\), and decision \\(d\\). The law of motion of \\(x_t\\) is given by \\(x_{t+1} = p(x_t,d_t)\\). Bellman principle of optimality states that the optimal policy is given by the following recursion \\[\nV(x_t) = \\max_{d_t} \\left \\{ u(x_t,d_t) + \\gamma \\mathbb{E} \\left [ V(x_{t+1}) \\right ] \\right \\}\n\\] where \\(\\gamma\\) is the discount factor. The optimal policy is given by \\[\nd_t^* = \\arg \\max_{d_t} \\left \\{ u(x_t,d_t) + \\gamma \\mathbb{E} \\left [ V(x_{t+1}) \\right ] \\right \\}.\n\\]\nNow, back to the secretary problem. Let \\(y^t = (y_1,\\ldots,y_t)\\) denote the history of observations up to time \\(t\\). State \\(x_t=1\\) if the \\(t\\)th candidate is the best seen so far and \\(x_t=0\\) otherwise. The decision \\(d_t=1\\) if the \\(t\\)th candidate is hired and \\(d_t=0\\) otherwise. The utility function is given by \\(u(x_t,d_t) = x_t d_t\\).  The Bellman equation is given by \\[\nP(\\text{best of T}\\mid x_t=1) = \\dfrac{P(\\text{best of T})}{P(x_t=1)} = \\dfrac{1/T}{1/t} = \\dfrac{t}{T}.\n\\] The \\(t\\)th offer is the best seen so far places no restriction on the relative ranks of the first \\(t-1\\) offers. Therefore, \\[\np(x_t=1,y^{t-1}) = p(x_t=1)p(y^{t-1})\n\\] by the independence assumption. Hence, we have \\[\np(x_t=1 \\mid y^{t-1}) = p(x_t=1) = \\dfrac{1}{t}.\n\\]\nLet \\(p^*(x_{t-1}=0)\\) be the probability under the optimal strategy. Now we have to select the best candidate, given we have seen \\(t-1\\) offers so far and the last one was not the best or worse. The probability satisfies the Bellman equation \\[\np^*(x_{t-1}=0) = \\frac{t-1}{t} p^*(x_{t}=0) + \\frac{1}{t}\\max\\left(t/T, p^*(x_{t}=0)\\right).\n\\] This leads to \\[\np^*(x_{t-1}=0) = \\frac{t-1}{T} \\sum_{\\tau=t-1}^{T-1}\\dfrac{1}{\\tau}.\n\\]\nRemember, the strategy is to reject the first \\(r\\) candidates and then select the first. The probability of selecting the best candidate is given by \\[\nP(\\text{success}) = \\dfrac{1}{T}\\sum_{a=r+1}^T \\dfrac{r}{a} \\approx  \\dfrac{1}{T}\\int_{r}^{T}\\dfrac{r}{a} = \\dfrac{r}{T} \\log \\left ( \\dfrac{T}{r} \\right ).\n\\] We optimize over \\(r\\) by setting the derivative \\[\n\\frac{\\log \\left(\\frac{T}{r}\\right)}{T}-\\frac{1}{T}\n\\] to zero, to find the optimal \\(r=T/e\\).\nIf we plug in \\(r=T/e\\) back to the probability of success, we get \\[\nP(\\text{success}) \\approx \\dfrac{1}{e} \\log \\left ( e \\right ) = \\dfrac{1}{e}.\n\\]\nMonte Carlo Simulations\nSimulations are a powerful tool for making decisions when we deal with a complex system, which is difficult or impossible to analyze mathematically. They are used in many fields, including finance, economics, and engineering. They can also be used to test hypotheses about how a system works and to generate data for statistical analysis.\nWe start by showing how the secretary problem can be analyzed using simulations rather than analytical derivations provided above.\n\nset.seed(17) # Kharlamov\nnmc = 1000\nn = 1000\nsz = 300\nrules = round(n*seq(0.002,0.8,length.out = sz))\nrules = unique(rules[rules&gt;0])\nsz = length(rules)\ncnt = rep(0,sz)\nquality = rep(0,sz)\nfor (i in 1:sz)\n{\n  for (j in 1:nmc){\n    x = sample(1:n,n)\n    screen = x[1:(rules[i]-1)]\n    best_screen = max(screen)\n    xchoice = x[(rules[i]):n]\n    better_candidates = which(xchoice &gt; best_screen)\n    if (length(better_candidates)==0)\n      choice = x[n]\n    else\n      choice = xchoice[min(better_candidates)]\n    cnt[i] = cnt[i] + (choice == max(x))\n    quality[i] = quality[i] + choice\n  }\n}\nd = data.frame(cnt=cnt, quality=quality,nmc=nmc, rules=rules)\n\n\nplot(d$rules, d$cnt/d$nmc, type='l', col=3, lwd=3, xlab=\"Number of Candidates Screened\", \n     ylab=\"Probability of Picking the Best\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(d$rules, d$quality/1000, type='l', col=3, lwd=3, xlab=\"Number of Candidates Screened\", \n     ylab=\"Average Quality of Candidate\")",

    "section": "9.3 Markov Decision Processes",
    "text": "9.3 Markov Decision Processes\nMarkov decision process (MDP) is a discrete time stochastic control process which provides a mathematical framework for modeling decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker. Almost all dynamic programming and reinforcement learning problems are formulated using the formalism of MDPs. MDPs are useful in various fields, including robotics, economics, and artificial intelligence. In fact, the multi-armed bandit problem considered before is a special case of MDP with one state. MDPs were known at least as early as the 1950s; a core body of research on Markov decision processes resulted from Ronald Howard’s 1960 book, Dynamic Programming and Markov Processes.\nA Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a mathematical framework used for modeling decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker. MDPs are useful in various fields, including robotics, economics, and artificial intelligence, particularly in reinforcement learning. An MDP is defined by:\n\nStates (\\(S\\)): A set of states representing different scenarios or configurations the system can be in. The key assumption here is the Markov property, which states that the future is independent of the past given the present. This means that the decision only depends on the current state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it.\nActions (\\(A\\)): A set of actions available in each state.\nTransition Probability (\\(P\\)): \\(P(s', r | s, a)\\) is the probability of transitioning to state \\(s'\\), receiving reward \\(r\\), given that action \\(a\\) is taken in state \\(s\\).\nReward (\\(R\\)): A reward function \\(R(s, a, s')\\) that gives the feedback signal immediately after transitioning from state \\(s\\) to state \\(s'\\), due to action \\(a\\).\nDiscount Factor (\\(\\gamma\\)): A factor between 0 and 1, which reduces the value of future rewards.\n\n\nMathematical Representation\nThe states \\(s_t\\) and rewards \\(R_t\\) in MDP are indexed by time \\(t\\). The state at time \\(t+1\\) is distributed according to the transition probability \\[\nP(s_{t+1}\\mid s_t,a_t).\n\\] The reward function is \\(R_s^a = E[R_{t+1} \\mid s, a]\\).\nThe Markov property of the state is that the transition probability depends only on the current state and action and not on the history of states and actions. \\[\nP(s_{t+1}\\mid s_t,a_t) = P(s_{t+1}\\mid s_t,a_t,s_{t-1},a_{t-1},\\ldots,s_0,a_0).\n\\] In other words, the future only depends on the present and not on the past history. The state is a sufficient statistic for the future.\nIn the case when the number of states is finite, we can represent the transition probability as a matrix \\(P_{ss'}^a = P(s_{t+1} = s' \\mid s_t = s, a_t = a)\\), where \\(s,s' \\in S\\) and \\(a \\in A\\). For a given action \\(a\\), the transition probability matrix \\(P^a\\) is a square matrix of size \\(|S| \\times |S|\\), where each row sums to 1 \\[\nP^a = \\begin{bmatrix}\nP_{11}^a & P_{12}^a & \\cdots & P_{1|S|}^a \\\\\nP_{21}^a & P_{22}^a & \\cdots & P_{2|S|}^a \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\nP_{|S|1}^a & P_{|S|2}^a & \\cdots & P_{|S||S|}^a\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\] The reward function is also a matrix \\(R_s^a = E[R_{t+1} \\mid s_t = s, a_t = a]\\).\nMarkov Reward Process\nWe can consider a simpler example of Markov Process. This is a special case of MDP when there is no action and the transition probability is simply a matrix \\(P_{ss'} = P(s_{t+1} = s' \\mid s_t = s)\\), where \\(s,s' \\in S\\). For a given action \\(a\\), the transition probability matrix \\(P^a\\) is a square matrix of size \\(|S| \\times |S|\\), where each row sums to 1.\n\nExample 9.2 (Student Example) The graph below represents possible states (nodes) and transitions (links). Each node has reward assigned to it which corresponds to the reward function \\(R(s)\\). The transition probabilities are shown on the links. The graph is a Markov Chain, a special case of MDP with no actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR\n    fb(\"Facebook; R=1\") --0.9--&gt; fb\n    fb--0.1--&gt;c1(\"Class 1; R=-2\")\n    c1--0.5--&gt;fb\n    c1--0.5--&gt;c2(\"Class 2; R=-2\")\n    c2--0.8--&gt;c3(\"Class 3; R=-2\")\n    c3--0.6--&gt;p(\"Pass; R=10\")\n    p--1.0--&gt;s(\"Sleep; R=0\")\n    c3--0.4--&gt;pub(\"Pub; R=3\")\n    pub--0.2--&gt;f(\"Fail; R=-20\")\n    f--1.0--&gt;s\n    pub--0.3--&gt;c3\n    pub--0.2--&gt;c1\n    pub--0.3--&gt;c2\n    c2--0.2--&gt;s\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we are to pick an initial state and sample a trajectory (path on the graph above) by picking a random action at each state, we will get a random walk on the graph. The reward for each state is shown in the graph. The discounted value of the trajectory is then \\[\nG_t = R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \\cdots = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\gamma^k R_{t+k+1},\n\\] where \\(\\gamma\\) is the discount factor. The discount factor is a number between 0 and 1 that determines the present value of future rewards. A discount factor of 0 makes the agent myopic and only concerned about immediate rewards. A discount factor of 1 makes the agent strive for a long-term high reward. The discount factor is usually denoted by \\(\\gamma\\) and is a parameter of the MDP. The discount of less than 1 is used to avoid infinite returns in cyclic Markov chains and allows us to discount less certain future rewards. The value of \\(\\gamma\\) is usually close to 1, for example 0.9 or 0.99. The value of \\(\\gamma\\) can be interpreted as the probability of the agent surviving from one time step to the next.\nWe can calculate sample returns \\(G_t\\) for this Markov Chain.

It can be drastically different from the reward value associated with the state. In our student example, the reward for the “Pub” state is 3, but the value is -1.2.\nThe value of a state can be calculated recursively using the Bellman equation \\[\\begin{align*}\nV(s) &= E[G_t \\mid s_t = s] \\\\\n&= E[R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \\cdots \\mid s_t = s] \\\\\n&= E[R_{t+1} + \\gamma G_{t+1} \\mid s_t = s] \\\\\n&= E[R_{t+1} + \\gamma V(s_{t+1}) \\mid s_t = s] \\\\\n&= \\sum_{s'} P(s' \\mid s) \\left[R(s) + \\gamma V(s')\\right].\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nExample 9.3 (Game of Chess as an MDP) We can consider a simple example of a game of chess.\nIn chess, a state \\(s\\) represents the configuration of the chessboard at any given time. This includes the positions of all the pieces (pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queen, and king) for both players (white and black). Each possible arrangement of these pieces on the chessboard is a unique state. The game starts in a standard initial state (the standard chess setup) and progresses through a series of states as moves are made. If the game is played to completion, it ends in a terminal state (checkmate, stalemate, or draw). Also if we reach a state that has been seen before multiple times in a row, we can stop the game and declare a draw. Thus, we need to remember the states we have seen before and essentially expand the state space to include the number of times we have seen the state. In a timed game, the game can also end when a player runs out of time.\nActions \\(a\\) in chess are the legal moves that can be made by the player whose turn it is to move. This includes moving pieces according to their allowed movements, capturing opponent pieces, and special moves like castling or en passant. The set of actions available changes with each state, depending on the position of the pieces on the board.\nIn chess, the transition probability is deterministic for the most part, meaning that the outcome of a specific action (move) is certain and leads to a predictable next state. For example, moving a knight from one position to another (assuming it’s a legal move) will always result in the same new configuration of the chessboard. However, in the context of playing against an opponent, there is uncertainty in predicting the opponent’s response, which can be seen as introducing a probabilistic element in the larger view of the game.\nDefining a reward function \\(R\\) in chess can be complex. In the simplest form, the reward could be associated with the game’s outcome: a win, loss, or draw. Wins could have positive rewards, losses negative, and draws could be neutral or have a small positive/negative value. Alternatively, more sophisticated reward functions can be designed to encourage certain strategies or positions, like controlling the center of the board, protecting the king, or capturing opponent pieces.\nChess is a game of perfect information, meaning all information about the game state is always available to both players. While the number of states in chess is finite, it is extremely large, making exhaustive state analysis (like traditional MDP methods) computationally impractical.\nIn practice, solving chess as an MDP, especially using traditional methods like value iteration or policy iteration, is not feasible due to the enormous state space. Modern approaches involve heuristic methods, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. For instance, advanced chess engines and AI systems like AlphaZero use deep neural networks and reinforcement learning to evaluate board positions and determine optimal moves, but they do not solve the MDP in the classical sense.\n\nThe goal in an MDP is to find a policy \\(a = \\pi(s)\\) (a function from states to actions) that maximizes the sum of discounted rewards: \\[\nV^\\pi(s) = E_{\\pi}[G_t \\mid S_t = s],\n\\] where \\[\nG_t = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^t R(s_t, \\pi(s_t), s_{t+1})\n\\]\nFunction \\(V^\\pi(s)\\) is the value of state s under policy \\(\\pi\\). Similarly we can define the action-value function \\(Q^\\pi(s,a)\\) as the value of taking action \\(a\\) in state \\(s\\) under policy \\(\\pi\\): \\[\nQ^\\pi(s,a) = E_{\\pi}[G_t \\mid S_t = s, A_t = a].\n\\]\nBellman Equations for MDP simply state that the value of a state is the sum of the immediate reward and the discounted value of the next state \\[\nV^\\pi(s) = E_{\\pi}[R_{t+1} + \\gamma V^{\\pi}(S_{t+1})\\mid S_t = s] = \\sum_{a\\in A}\\pi(a\\mid s)\\left(R_s^a + \\gamma \\sum_{s'\\in S}P^a_{ss'}V^pi(s') \\right).\n\\] The action-value function satisfies the following Bellman equation \\[\nQ^\\pi(s,a) = E_{\\pi}[R_{t+1} + \\gamma Q^{\\pi}(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1})\\mid S_t = s, A_t = a].\n\\] The value function can be defined as an expectation over the action-value function \\[\nV^\\pi(s) = E_{\\pi}[Q^\\pi(s,a)\\mid S_t = s] = \\sum_{a\\in A}\\pi(a\\mid s)Q^\\pi(s,a).\n\\] In matrix form, we have \\[\nQ^\\pi(s,a) = R_s^a + \\gamma \\sum_{s'\\in S}P_{ss'}^a V^\\pi(s') = R_s^s + \\gamma \\sum_{s'\\in S}P_{ss'}^a\\sum_{a'\\in A}\\pi(a'\\mid s')Q^\\pi(s',a').\n\\] Now we can define the Bellman equation in the matrix form \\[\nV^\\pi = R^\\pi + \\gamma P^\\pi V^\\pi.\n\\] The direct solution is then \\[\nV^\\pi = (I - \\gamma P^\\pi)^{-1}R^\\pi.\n\\] The optimal value function \\(V^*(s)\\) is the value function for the optimal policy \\(\\pi^*(s)\\) \\[\nV^*(s) = \\max_\\pi V^\\pi(s).\n\\] The optimal action-value function \\(Q^*(s,a)\\) is the action-value function for the optimal policy \\(\\pi^*(s)\\) \\[\nQ^*(s,a) = \\max_\\pi Q^\\pi(s,a).\n\\] The optimal policy \\(\\pi^*(s)\\) is the policy that maximizes the value function \\[\n\\pi^*(s) = \\arg\\max_a Q^*(s,a).\n\\] The optimal value function satisfies the Bellman optimality equation \\[\nV^*(s) = \\max_a Q^*(s,a).\n\\] and vice-versa \\[\nQ^*(s,a) = R_s^a + \\gamma \\sum_{s'\\in S}P_{ss'}^a V^*(s').\n\\]\nThe Bellman optimality equation is non-linear and is typically solved iteratively using Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, or Q-learning. Q-learning is an off-policy algorithm that learns the optimal policy by directly estimating the optimal action-value function \\(Q^*(s,a)\\). The algorithm iteratively updates the action-value function using the Bellman optimality backup. The off-policy means that the algorithm learns the optimal policy while following a different policy. The algorithm can learn the optimal policy while following a random policy, for example.\n\n\nMDP Solvers\nThe underlying approach behind all MDP solvers is to iteratively apply the Bellman equations until convergence. The main difference between the solvers is how they update the value function. All of them use dynamic programming approach to find optimal policy. Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. If a problem can be solved by combining optimal solutions to non-overlapping subproblems, the strategy is called divide and conquer instead. This is why dynamic programming is applicable to solving MDPs.\nFirst, we consider how to find the values of states under a given policy \\(\\pi\\). We can iteratively apply Bellman expectation backup. We update the values using the following update rule \\[\nV_{k+1}(s) = \\sum_{a} \\pi(a \\mid s) \\sum_{s'} P(s' \\mid s, a)[R(s, a, s') + \\gamma V_k(s')].\n\\] We will introduce the short-cut notation \\[  \nP_{ss'}^a = P(s' \\mid s, a), \\quad R_s^a = \\sum_{s'} P(s' \\mid s, a)R(s, a, s').\n\\] Then in matrix form the update rule becomes \\[\nV_{k+1} = R^{\\pi} + \\gamma P^{\\pi} V_k.\n\\]\nThe policy iteration algorithm involves two main steps: policy evaluation and policy improvement, which are iteratively applied until convergence. We start with an arbitrary value function, often initialized to zero for all states. \\[\\begin{align*}\nV_0(s) &= 0 \\\\\nV_{k+1} = & R^{\\pi} + \\gamma P^{\\pi} V_k\\\\\n\\pi_{k+1} &= \\arg\\max_a R^a + \\gamma P^a V_{k+1} = \\arg\\max_a Q^\\pi(s,a)\n\\end{align*}\\] The last step is to simply choose the action that maximizes the expected return in each state. Although it can be slow in practice, the convergence is guaranteed because the value function is a contraction mapping. We typically stop the iterations when the maximum change in the value function is below a threshold.\nIt can be used for calculating the optimal policy. The Bellman optimality equation is a fundamental part of finding the best policy in MDPs. \\[\nV^*(s) = \\max_a \\sum_{s', r} P(s', r | s, a)[r + \\gamma V^*(s')]\n\\] The optimal policy is then \\[\n\\pi^*(s) = \\arg\\max_a \\sum_{s', r} P(s', r | s, a)[r + \\gamma V^*(s')]\n\\] The optimal policy is the one that maximizes the value function. The optimal value function is the value function for the optimal policy. The optimal value function satisfies the Bellman optimality equation. The optimal policy can be found by maximizing the right hand side of the Bellman optimality equation.\nGiven an optimal policy, we can subdivide it into two parts: the optimal first action \\(A^*\\) and the optimal policy from the next state \\(S'\\). The optimal value \\(V^*\\) can be found using one-step lookahead \\[\nV^*(s) = \\max_a R_s^a +  \\gamma \\sum_{s'\\in S} P_{ss'}^a V^*(s')\n\\] This allows us to define another approach to solving MDPs, called value iteration. The value iteration algorithm starts with an arbitrary value function and iteratively applies the Bellman optimality backup. The algorithm updates the value function using the following update rule \\[\nV_{k+1}(s) = \\max_a R_s^a +  \\gamma \\sum_{s'\\in S} P_{ss'}^a V_k(s').\n\\] In matrix form, the update rule becomes \\[\nV_{k+1} = \\max_a R^a + \\gamma P^a V_k.\n\\] The algorithm stops when the maximum change in the value function is below a threshold. The optimal policy can be found by maximizing the right hand side of the Bellman optimality equation \\[\n\\pi^*(s) = \\arg\\max_a R_s^a +  \\gamma \\sum_{s'\\in S} P_{ss'}^a V^*(s').\n\\]\nIn practice, exactly solving the Bellman Expectation Equation in the policy evaluation step can be computationally expensive for large state spaces. Approximate methods may be used. Policy Iteration is particularly effective when the optimal policy needs to be very precise, as in high-stakes decision-making environments.\n\nExample 9.4 (MDP for a Maze) We use a mazemdp archive by Sally Gao, Duncan Rule, Yi Hao to demonstrate the value and policy iterations. Both are applied to the problem of finding an optimal policy for a maze. The maze is represented as a grid, with each cell either being a wall or empty. Agent (decision maker) does not know the maze structure and needs to find the optimal path from the start to the goal state. The agent starts in the bottom right corner and needs to reach the top left corner (marked as red). The agent can move up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally (actions). Moving into a wall keeps the agent in the same cell. Reaching the goal state gives a reward of +1, and all other transitions give a reward of 0. The goal is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the expected return (sum of discounted rewards) for the agent. In other words, the agent needs to find the shortest path to the exit.\nFigures below show the snapshot from policy (top row) and value (bottom row) iterations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(t=0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(t=12\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(t=24\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: Policy Iteration Solver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(t=0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(t=15\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(t=30\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.4: Value Iteration Solver\n\n\n\nThe policy iterations converged after 24 iterations.\n\n\nExample 9.5 (MDP for Forest Management) We can consider one of the classic examples of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Imagine you need to calculate an optimal policy to manage a forest to prevent possible fires. The goal is to decide between two possible actions to either ‘Wait’ or ‘Cut’. They correspond to balancing between ecological preservation and economic gain, considering the random event of a fire. We can break down the elements of this model.\n\nStates: Represent the age of the forest. The states are denoted as \\(\\{0, 1,\\ldots, S-1\\}\\), where 0 is the youngest state (just after a fire or cutting) and \\(S-1\\) is the oldest state of the forest.\nActions: There are two actions available:\n\n‘Wait’ (Action 0): Do nothing and let the forest grow for another year.\n‘Cut’ (Action 1): Harvest the forest, which brings immediate economic benefit but resets its state to the youngest.\n\nProbabilities: There’s a probability ‘p’ each year that a fire occurs, regardless of the action taken. If a fire occurs, the forest returns to state 0.\nTransition Matrix (P): This matrix defines the probabilities of moving from one state to another, given a specific action.\n\nWe will use mdp_example_forest function from the MDPtoolbox package to generate the transition probability matrix and reward matrix for the Forest example.\n\nlibrary(MDPtoolbox)\n# Define the transition and reward matrices for the Forest example\nres = mdp_example_forest(S=4,r1=10,r2=1,p=0.01)\n\nThis function generates a transition probability \\(P\\) of size \\((|A| \\times |S| \\times |S|\\), there are three states by default \\(S = \\{0,1,2\\}\\) and two actions.\nres$P[,,1]\nres$P[,,2]\n\n\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,] 0.01 0.99 0.00 0.00\n[2,] 0.01 0.00 0.99 0.00\n[3,] 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.99\n[4,] 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.99\n\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    1    0    0    0\n[2,]    1    0    0    0\n[3,]    1    0    0    0\n[4,]    1    0    0    0\n\n\n\nAs well as the reward matrix \\(R\\) of size \\(|S| \\times |A|\\).\n\nres$R\n\n     R1 R2\n[1,]  0  0\n[2,]  0  1\n[3,]  0  1\n[4,] 10  1\n\n\n\nmdp_value_iteration(res$P, res$R, discount = 0.9, epsilon = 1e-6, max_iter = 10000)\n\n \"MDP Toolbox WARNING: max_iter is bounded by  5000\"\n \"MDP Toolbox: iterations stopped, epsilon-optimal policy found\"\n\n\n 13 21 30 40\n\n$policy\n[1] 1 1 1 1\n\n$iter\n[1] 5\n\n$time\nTime difference of 0.0011 secs\n\n$epsilon\n[1] 1e-06\n\n$discount\n[1] 0.9\n\nmdp_policy_iteration(res$P, res$R, discount=0.9)\n\n  4.7  5.2  5.2 92.1\n\n$policy\n[1] 1 2 2 1\n\n$iter\n[1] 1\n\n$time\nTime difference of 0.011 secs\n\n\n\nA more general form of a value function is the action-value function \\(Q^\\pi(s,a)\\), which represents the expected return when starting from state \\(s\\), taking action \\(a\\), and following policy \\(\\pi\\) thereafter. \\[\nQ^\\pi(s,a) = E_{\\pi}\\left[G_t \\mid s_t = s, a_t = a\\right].\n\\] We can derive both the value and optimal policy functions from the action-value function: \\[\nV^\\pi(s) = \\sum_{a \\in A} \\pi(a|s) Q^\\pi(s,a)\n\\] \\[\n\\pi^*(s) = \\arg\\max_a Q^*(s,a)\n\\]\n\n\nModel-Free Methods\nBoth policy and value iterations we’ve considered thus far assume that transition probabilities between states given actions are known. However, this is often not the case in many real-world problems. Model-free methods learn through trial and error, by interacting with the environment and observing the rewards. The first method we consider is Monte Carlo methods. Monte Carlo methods for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are a class of algorithms used for finding optimal policies when the model of the environment (i.e., the transition probabilities and rewards) is unknown or too complex to model explicitly. These methods rely on learning from experience, specifically from complete episodes of interaction with the environment. Here’s a detailed look at how Monte Carlo methods work in the context of MDPs:\n\nGenerate Episodes: An episode is a sequence of states, actions, and rewards, from the start state to a terminal state. \\[\nS_0, A_0, R_1, S_1, A_1, R_2, \\ldots, S_{T-1}, A_{T-1}, R_T \\sim \\pi.\n\\] In Monte Carlo methods, these episodes are generated through actual or simulated interaction with the environment, based on a certain policy.\nEstimate Value Functions: Unlike dynamic programming methods, which update value estimates based on other estimated values, Monte Carlo methods update estimates based on actual returns received over complete episodes. This involves averaging the returns received after visits to each state. We use empirical mean to estimate the expected value.\nPolicy Improvement: After a sufficient number of episodes have been generated and value functions estimated, the policy is improved based on these value function estimates.\n\nMonte Carlo methods require complete episodes to update value estimates. This makes them particularly suitable for episodic tasks, where interactions naturally break down into separate episodes with clear starting and ending points. MC methods require sufficient exploration of the state space. This can be achieved through various strategies, like \\(\\epsilon\\)-greedy policies, where there’s a small chance of taking a random action instead of the current best-known action. In this case, the policy is given by \\[\n\\pi(a \\mid s) = \\begin{cases}\n1 - \\epsilon + \\frac{\\epsilon}{|A|} & \\text{if } a = \\arg\\max_{a'} Q(s,a') \\\\\n\\frac{\\epsilon}{|A|} & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\] where \\(\\epsilon\\) is the probability of taking a random action and \\(|A|\\) is the number of actions. The \\(\\epsilon\\)-greedy policy is an example of an exploration-exploitation strategy, where the agent explores the environment by taking random actions (exploration) while also exploiting the current knowledge of the environment by taking the best-known action (exploitation). The value of \\(\\epsilon\\) is typically decayed over time, so that the agent explores more in the beginning and exploits more later on.\nMonte Carlo methods are model-free, meaning they do not require a model of the environment (transition probabilities and rewards). They are also effective in dealing with high variance in returns, which can be an issue in some environments. However, they can be inefficient due to high variance and the need for many episodes to achieve accurate value estimates. They also require careful handling of the exploration-exploitation trade-off. The two main approaches for Monte Carlo methods are first-visit and every-visit methods.\n\nFirst-Visit MC: In this approach, the return for a state is averaged over all first visits to that state in each episode.\nEvery-Visit Monte Carlo: Here, the return is averaged over every visit to the state, not just the first visit in each episode.\n\nMonte Carlo Policy Iteration involves alternating between policy evaluation (estimating the value function of the current policy using Monte Carlo methods) and policy improvement (improving the policy based on the current value function estimate). This process is repeated until the policy converges to the optimal policy.\nTo find the optimal policy, a balance between exploration and exploitation must be maintained. This is achieved through strategies like \\(\\epsilon\\)-greedy exploration. In Monte Carlo Control, the policy is often improved in a greedy manner based on the current value function estimate.\nRecall that an arithmetic average can be updated recursively \\[\n\\bar{x}_n = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = \\frac{1}{n}\\left(x_n + \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_i\\right) = \\frac{1}{n}\\left(x_n + (n-1)\\bar{x}_{n-1}\\right) = \\bar{x}_{n-1} + \\frac{1}{n}(x_n - \\bar{x}_{n-1}).\n\\] This is called a running average. We can use this recursion to update the value function \\(V(s)\\) incrementally, each time we visit state \\(s\\) at time \\(t\\). \\[\nV(s_t) = V(s_t) + \\frac{1}{N(s_t)}(G_t - V(s_t)),\n\\] where \\(N(s_t)\\) is the number of times we visited state \\(s_t\\) before time \\(t\\) and \\(G_t\\) is the return at time \\(t\\). This is called first-visit Monte Carlo method. Alternatively, we can use every-visit Monte Carlo method, where we update the value function each time we visit state \\(s\\).\nAlternatively, we can use a learning rate \\(\\alpha\\) \\[\nV_{n+1} = V_n + \\alpha(G_n - V_n).\n\\] This is called constant step size update. The learning rate is a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned. The constant step size update is more convenient because it does not require keeping track of the number of visits to each state. The constant step size update is also more robust to non-stationary problems.\nTemporal Difference Learning (TD Learning) Similar to MC, TD methods learn directly from raw experience without a model of the environment. However, unlike MC methods, TD methods update value estimates based on other learned estimates, without waiting for the end of an episode. This is called bootstrapping. TD methods combine the sampling efficiency of Monte Carlo methods with the low variance of dynamic programming methods. They are also model-free and can learn directly from raw experience. However, they are more complex than MC methods and require careful tuning of the learning rate.\nA simple TD method is TD(0), which updates value estimates based on the current reward and the estimated value of the next state. The update rule is \\[\nV(S_t) = V(S_t) + \\alpha(R_{t+1} + \\gamma V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)),\n\\] where \\(\\alpha\\) is the learning rate. The TD(0) method is also called one-step TD because it only looks one step ahead. The \\(R_{t+1} + \\gamma V(S_{t+1})\\) term is called the TD target and is a biased estimate of \\(V(S_t)\\). The difference \\(R_{t+1} + \\gamma V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)\\) is called the TD error. The TD target is an estimate of the return \\(G_t\\) and the TD error is the difference between the TD target and the current estimate \\(V(S_t)\\). Although TD algorithms have lower variance than MC methods, they have higher bias. In practice TD methods are more efficient than MC methods.\n\n\nQ-Learning\nQ-learning is an off-policy algorithm that learns the optimal policy by directly estimating the optimal action-value function \\(Q^*(s,a)\\). The algorithm iteratively updates the action-value function using the Bellman optimality backup. The off-policy means that the algorithm learns the optimal policy while following a different policy. The algorithm can learn the optimal policy while following a random policy, for example. The algorithm can be summarized as follows: \\[\nQ(S_t,A_t) = Q(S_t,A_t) + \\alpha(R_{t+1} + \\gamma \\max_a Q(S_{t+1},a) - Q(S_t,A_t)),\n\\] where \\(\\alpha\\) is the learning rate. The algorithm can be summarized as follows:\n\nInitialize \\(Q(s,a)\\) arbitrarily\nRepeat for each episode:\n\nInitialize \\(S\\)\nRepeat for each step of the episode:\n\nChoose \\(A\\) from \\(S\\) using policy derived from \\(Q\\) (e.g., \\(\\epsilon\\)-greedy)\nTake action \\(A\\), observe \\(R\\), \\(S'\\)\n\\(Q(S,A) = Q(S,A) + \\alpha(R + \\gamma \\max_a Q(S',a) - Q(S,A))\\)\n\\(S = S'\\)\n\nUntil \\(S\\) is terminal\n\n\nThen we can simplify the update rule to \\[\nQ(S_t,A_t) = (1-\\alpha)Q(S_t,A_t) + \\alpha(R_{t+1} + \\gamma \\max_a Q(S_{t+1},a)).\n\\]\n\nExample 9.6 (Q-Learning and Deal or No Deal) Deal or No Deal is a popular TV show where a contestant is presented with a number of sealed boxes, each containing a prize. The contestant selects a box and then proceeds to open the remaining boxes one by one. After a certain number of boxes have been opened, the banker makes an offer to buy the contestant’s box. The contestant can either accept the offer and sell the box or reject the offer and continue opening boxes. The game continues until the contestant either accepts an offer or opens all the boxes. The goal is to maximize the expected value of the prize in the contestant’s box. The rule of thumb is to continue as long as there are two large prizes left. Continuation value is large. For example, with three prizes and two large ones, risk averse people will naively choose deal, when if they incorporated the continuation value they would choose no deal.\nLet \\(s\\) denote the current state of the system and \\(a\\) an action. The \\(Q\\)-value, \\(Q_t(s,a)\\), is the value of using action \\(a\\) today and then proceeding optimally in the future. We use \\(a=1\\) to mean no deal and \\(a=0\\) means deal. The Bellman equation for \\(Q\\)-values becomes \\[\nQ_{t} ( s , a) = u( s , a  ) + \\sum_{ s^\\star } P( s^\\star | s ,a ) \\max_{ a } Q_{t+1} ( s^\\star , a )\n\\] where \\(u(s,a)\\) is the immediate utility of taking action \\(a\\) in state \\(s\\). The value function and optimal action are given by \\[\nV(s) = \\max_a Q ( s , a ) \\; \\; \\text{and} \\; \\;  a^\\star = \\text{argmax}  Q ( s , a )\n\\]\nTransition Matrix: Consider the problem where you have three prizes left. Now \\(s\\) is the current state of three prizes. \\[\ns^\\star = \\{ \\text{all \\; sets \\; of \\; two \\; prizes} \\} \\; \\; \\text{and} \\; \\; P( s^\\star | s, a =1) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\] where the transition matrix is uniform to the next state. There’s no continuation for \\(P( s^\\star | s, a =0)\\).\nUtility: The utility of the next state depends on the contestant’s value for money and the bidding function of the banker \\[\nu( B ( s^\\star ) ) = \\frac{ B ( s^\\star )^{1-\\gamma} -1 }{1 - \\gamma }\n\\] in power utility case.\nExpected value implies \\(B( s ) = \\bar{s}\\) where \\(s\\) are the remaining prizes.\nThe website uses the following criteria: with three prizes left: \\[\nB( s) = 0.305 \\times \\text{big} + 0.5 \\times \\text{small}\n\\] and with two prizes left \\[\nB( s) = 0.355 \\times \\text{big} + 0.5 \\times \\text{small}   \n\\]\nThree prizes left: \\(s = \\{ 750 , 500 , 25 \\}\\).\nAssume the contestant is risk averse with log-utility \\(U(x) = \\ln x\\). Banker offers the expected value we get \\[\nu( B( s = \\{ 750 , 500 , 25 \\}) ) = \\ln ( 1275/3  ) = 6.052\n\\] and so \\(Q_t ( s , a= 0 ) = 6.052\\).\nIn the continuation problem, \\(s^\\star = \\{ s_1^\\star , s_2^\\star , s_3^\\star  \\}\\) where \\(s_1^\\star = \\{750,500 \\}\\) and \\(s_2^\\star = \\{ 750,25 \\}\\) and \\(s_3^\\star = \\{ 500,25 \\}\\).\nWe’ll have offers \\(625 , 387.5 , 137.5\\) under the expected value. As the banker offers expected value the optimal action at time \\(t+1\\) is to take the deal \\(a=0\\) with Q-values given by \\[\\begin{align*}\nQ_{t} ( s , a=1) & = \\sum_{ s^\\star } P( s^\\star | s ,a =1) \\max_{ a } Q_{t+1} ( s^\\star , a ) \\\\\n& = \\frac{1}{3} \\left (  \\ln (625) + \\ln (387.5) + \\ln (262.5) \\right ) = 5.989\n\\end{align*}\\] as immediate utility \\(u( s,a ) = 0\\). Hence as \\[\nQ_{t} ( s , a=1)=5.989 &lt;  6.052 = Q_{t} ( s , a=0)\n\\] the optimal action is \\(a^\\star = 0\\), deal. Continuation value is not large enough to overcome the generous (expected value) offered by the banker.\nSensitivity analysis: we perform it by assuming different Banker’s bidding function. If we use the function from the website (2 prizes): \\[\nB( s) = 0.355 \\times \\text{big} + 0.5 \\times \\text{small},\n\\] Hence \\[\\begin{align*}\nB( s_1^\\star = \\{750,500 \\}) &  = 516.25 \\\\\nB( s_2^\\star = \\{ 750,25 \\}) & =  278.75 \\\\\nB( s_3^\\star = \\{ 500,25 \\}) &  = 190  \n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe optimal action with two prizes left for the contestant is \\[\\begin{align*}\nQ_{t+1} ( s_1^\\star , a=1) & = \\frac{1}{2} \\left (  \\ln (750) + \\ln (500) \\right ) = 6.415 \\\\\n& &gt; 6.246 = Q_{t+1} ( s_1^\\star , a=0) = \\ln \\left ( 516.25 \\right ) \\\\\nQ_{t+1} ( s_1^\\star , a=1) & = \\frac{1}{2} \\left (  \\ln (750) + \\ln (25) \\right ) = 4.9194 \\\\\n& &lt; 5.63 = Q_{t+1} ( s_1^\\star , a=0)  = \\ln \\left ( 278.75 \\right ) \\\\\nQ_{t+1} ( s_1^\\star , a=1) & = \\frac{1}{2} \\left (  \\ln (500) + \\ln (25) \\right ) = 4.716 \\\\\n& &lt; 5.247 = Q_{t+1} ( s_1^\\star , a=0)  = \\left ( 516.25 \\right ) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\] Hence future optimal policy will be no deal under \\(s_1^\\star\\), and deal under \\(s_2^\\star , s_3^\\star\\).\nTherefore solving for \\(Q\\)-values at the previous step gives \\[\\begin{align*}\nQ_{t} ( s , a=1) & = \\sum_{ s^\\star } P( s^\\star | s ,a =1) \\max_{ a } Q_{t+1} ( s^\\star , a ) \\\\\n& = \\frac{1}{3} \\left (  6.415+ 5.63 + 5.247 \\right ) = 5.764\n\\end{align*}\\] with a monetary equivalent as \\(\\exp(5.764  ) = 318.62\\).\nWith three prizes we have \\[\\begin{align*}\nQ_{t} ( s , a=0) & = u( B( s = \\{ 750 , 500 , 25 \\}) ) \\\\\n& = \\ln \\left ( 0.305 \\times 750 + 0.5 \\times 25 \\right ) \\\\\n& = \\ln ( 241.25 ) = 5.48.\n\\end{align*}\\] The contestant is offered $ 241.\nNow we have \\(Q_{t} ( s , a=1)= 5.7079  &gt; 5.48 = Q_{t} ( s , a=0)\\) and the optimal action is \\(a^\\star = 1\\), no deal. The continuation value is large. The premium is $ 241 compared to $319, a 33% premium.",

    "text": "9.4 Bayesian Optimization\nBayesian optimization is a sequential design strategy for global optimization of black-box functions that does not assume any functional forms. It is particularly useful when the objective function is expensive to evaluate. Bayesian optimization uses a surrogate model to approximate the objective function and an acquisition function to decide where to sample next. The surrogate model is typically a Gaussian process (GP) model, which is a probabilistic model that defines a distribution over functions. The acquisition function is a heuristic that trades off exploration and exploitation to decide where to sample next. Bayesian optimization is a global optimization method, meaning it does not require derivatives and can find the global optimum of the objective function. It is also sample-efficient, meaning it can find the optimum with fewer samples than other methods. However, it can be slow in practice and is not suitable for high-dimensional problems.\nGiven a function \\(f(x)\\) that is not known analytically (it can represent, for example, output of a complex computer program), the goal is to optimize \\[\nx^* = \\arg\\min_x f(x).\n\\]\nThe Bayesian approach to this problem is the following:\n\nDefine a prior distribution over \\(f(x)\\)\nCalculate \\(f\\) at a few points \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\)\nRepeat until convergence:\n\nUpdate the prior to get the posterior distribution over \\(f(x)\\)\nChoose the next point \\(x^+\\) to evaluate \\(f(x)\\)\nCalculate \\(f(x^+)\\)\n\nPick \\(x^*\\) that corresponds to the smallest value of \\(f(x)\\) among evaluated points\n\nThe prior distribution is typically a Gaussian process (GP) model, which is a probabilistic model that defines a distribution over functions. The GP model is defined by a mean function \\(m(x)\\) and a covariance function \\(k(x,x')\\). The mean function is typically set to zero. The covariance function is typically a squared exponential function \\[\nk(x,x') = \\sigma_f^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-x')^2}{2l^2}\\right),\n\\] where \\(\\sigma_f^2\\) is the signal variance and \\(l\\) is the length scale. The covariance function defines the similarity between two points \\(x\\) and \\(x'\\). The covariance function is also called a kernel function. The kernel function is a measure of similarity between inputs \\(x\\) and \\(x'\\).\nNow we need to decide where to sample next. We can use the acquisition function to decide where to sample next. The acquisition function is a heuristic that trades off exploration and exploitation to decide where to sample next. The expected improvement (EI) function is a popular acquisition function. Suppose \\[\nf^* = \\min y\n\\] is the minimum value of \\(f(x)\\) among evaluated points. At a given point \\(x\\) and function value \\(y = f(x)\\), the expected improvement function is defined as \\[\na(x) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\max(0, f^* - y)\\right],\n\\] The function that we calculate expectation of \\[\nu(x) = \\max(0, f^* - y)\n\\] is the utility function. Thus, the acquisition function is the expected value of the utility function.\nThe acquisition function is high when \\(y\\) is likely to be lower than \\(f^*\\), and low when \\(y\\) is likely to be higher than \\(f^*\\). Given the GP prior, we can calculate the acquisition function analytically. The posterior distribution of Normal \\(y \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\), then the acquisition function is \\[\\begin{align*}\na(x) &= \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\max(0, f^* - y)\\right] \\\\\n&= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\max(0, f^* - y) \\phi(y,\\mu,\\sigma^2) dy \\\\\n&= \\int_{-\\infty}^{f^*} (f^* - y) \\phi(y,\\mu,\\sigma^2) dy\n\\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\phi(y,\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\) is the probability density function of the normal distribution. A useful identity is \\[\n\\int y \\phi(y,\\mu,\\sigma^2) dy =\\frac{1}{2} \\mu ~  \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{y-\\mu }{\\sqrt{2} \\sigma }\\right)-\\frac{\\sigma\n   e^{-\\frac{(y-\\mu )^2}{2 \\sigma ^2}}}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi }},\n\\] where \\(\\Phi(y,\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\) is the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution. Thus, \\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{f^*} y \\phi(y,\\mu,\\sigma^2) dy = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu (1+\\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{f^*-\\mu }{\\sqrt{2} \\sigma\n   }\\right))-\\frac{\\sigma  e^{-\\frac{(f^*-\\mu )^2}{2 \\sigma ^2}}}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} = \\mu \\Phi(f^*,\\mu,\\sigma^2) + \\sigma^2 \\phi(f^*,\\mu,\\sigma^2).\n\\]\nwe can write the acquisition function as \\[\na(x) = \\dfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\sigma^2 \\phi(f^*,\\mu,\\sigma^2) + (f^*-\\mu)\\Phi(f^*,\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\right)\n\\]\nWe can implement it\n\nacq &lt;- function(xx,p, fstar) {\n  x = matrix(xx, ncol=1)\n  d = fstar - p$mean\n  s = sqrt(diag(p$Sigma))\n  return(s*dnorm(d) + d*pnorm(d))\n}\n\n\nExample 9.7 (Taxi Fleet Optimisation) We will use the taxi fleet simulator from Emukit project. For a given demand (the frequency of trip requests) and the number of taxis in the fleet, it simulates the taxi fleet operations and calculates the profit. The simulator is a black-box function, meaning it does not have an analytical form and can only be evaluated at specific points. The goal is to find the optimal number of taxis in the fleet that maximizes the profit. We will use Bayesian optimization to solve this problem.\n\n\n\nTaxi Simulator Visualization\n\n\nWe start with initial set of three designs \\(x = (10,30,90)\\), where \\(x\\) is the number of the taxis in the fleet and observe the corresponding profits profit=(3.1,3.6,6.6). When \\(x=10\\), the demand for taxis exceeds the supply and passengers need to wait for their rides, leading to missed profit opportunities. At another extreme when we have 90 taxis, the profit is slightly better. However, there are many empty taxis, which is not profitable. The optimal number of taxis must be somewhere in the middle. Finally, we try 30 taxis and observe that the profit is higher than both of our previous attempts. However, should we increase or decrease the number of taxis from here? We can use Bayesian optimization to answer this question. First we define a convenience function to plot the GP emulator.\n\nplotgp = function(x,y,XX,p) {\n  q1 = qnorm(0.05, mean = p$mean, sd = sqrt(diag(p$Sigma)))\n  q2 = qnorm(0.95, mean = p$mean, sd = sqrt(diag(p$Sigma)))\n  q3 = qnorm(0.5, mean = p$mean, sd = sqrt(diag(p$Sigma)))\n  ggplot() + \n    geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n    geom_line(aes(x=XX,y=q3), col=2, lwd=2) + \n    geom_ribbon(aes(x=XX, ymin=q1, ymax=q2), fill=\"blue\", alpha=0.2)\n}\n\nNow, we fit the GP emulator using our initial set of observed taxi-profit pairs.\n\nlibrary(laGP)\nlibrary(mvtnorm)\nx = matrix(c(10,90,30), ncol=1)\nxx = seq(1,100, length=500)\nXX &lt;- matrix(xx, ncol = ncol(x))\nprofit = -c(3.1,3.6,6.6)\ngp &lt;- newGP(x, profit, 1000, 1e-6, dK = TRUE)\np &lt;- predGP(gp, XX)\nplotgp(x,profit,XX,p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of maximizing the profit, we minimize the negative profit. We see that there is potentially a better value at around 50 taxis. We can use the acquisition function to decide where to sample next. We define two functions: nextsample that uses the acquisition function to decide where to sample next and updgp that updates the GP emulator with the new sample. Then we call those two functions twice. First time, EI suggests 44 and second time it suggests 42. We update the GP emulator with the new samples and plot the updated emulator. We see that the GP emulator is updated to reflect the new samples.\nnextsample = function(){\n  ei = acq(xx,p,min(profit))\n  plot(xx,ei, type='l', col=2, lwd=2)\n  xnext = as.integer(xx[which.max(ei)])\n  return(xnext)\n}\nupdgp = function(xnext,f){\n  profit &lt;&lt;- c(profit, f)\n  x &lt;&lt;- c(x, xnext)\n  updateGP(gp, matrix(xnext,ncol=1), f)\n  p &lt;&lt;- predGP(gp, XX)\n  plotgp(x,profit,XX,p)\n}\nnextsample(); #44\nupdgp(44, -8.4);\nnextsample(); # 57\nupdgp(57, -7.1);\nnextsample(); # 45\nupdgp(45, -8.5);\nnextsample(); # 100\nupdgp(100, -3.3);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we run nextsample one more time, we get 47, close to our current best of 45. Further, the model is confident at this location. It means that we can stop the algorithm and declare victory.\n\nnextsample()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 47",

    "text": "9.5 Concluding Remarks\nIn this chapter, we explored the foundational concepts of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and their central role in reinforcement learning. We saw how MDPs provide a flexible mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision-making under uncertainty, with applications ranging from robotics and operations research to online recommendation systems and resource allocation in business.\nThrough both analytical derivations and Monte Carlo simulations, we examined classic problems such as the secretary problem and taxi fleet optimization, illustrating how simulation and Bayesian optimization can be used to make effective decisions in complex, uncertain environments. The use of Gaussian Process (GP) emulators and acquisition functions like Expected Improvement (EI) demonstrates the power of combining probabilistic modeling with principled exploration strategies—a hallmark of modern reinforcement learning.\nAs you continue your study of reinforcement learning, remember that the real world rarely presents us with simple, fully known models. The techniques introduced here—modeling uncertainty, simulating outcomes, and iteratively improving decisions—are essential tools for tackling the challenges of real-world AI and data-driven decision making. Whether you are optimizing ad placements, managing supply chains, or designing intelligent agents, the principles of MDPs and Bayesian optimization will serve as a strong foundation for your work.\n\n\n\n\nScott, Steven L. 2015. “Multi-Armed Bandit Experiments in the Online Service Economy.” Applied Stochastic Models in Business and Industry 31 (1): 37–45.",

    "text": "10.1 The Wisdom and Madness of Crowds\nData collected by early telescopes played a crucial role in the development of statistical techniques during the 18th century, just as Internet and mobile devices do in the 21st. Massive astronomical data sets inspired scientists such as Carl Friedrich Gauss, Pierre-Simon Laplace, and Simeon Denis Poisson to devise data-driven methods, including the method of least squares and the Poisson distribution. These methods not only revolutionized astronomy but are also used nowadays in various fields, such as physics, engineering, and economics. The development of these methods marked a significant shift in the scientific approach, enabling more rigorous analysis and interpretation of observational data. The integration of data and statistical methods laid the foundation for modern data science and statistics, demonstrating the power and versatility of data-driven approaches.\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries data collection was often limited to manual measurements or observations, and the amount of available data was typically much smaller compared to the massive datasets encountered in modern data science. Scientists like Gauss and Poisson often conducted carefully designed experiments, collected their own data, and performed manual calculations without the aid of computers or advanced statistical software. The focus of their work was often on theoretical developments in mathematics, physics and astronomy, and the data was used to test and validate their theories. We can consider one of those studies from the early 18th century.\nMotivated by the analysis of planetary orbits and determining the shape of the Earth, later in 1805, Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) published the first clear and concise explanation of the least squares method in his book “Nouvelles methodes pour la determination des orbites des cometes”. The method of least squares is a powerful statistical technique used today to fit a mathematical model to a set of data points. Its goal is to find the best-fitting curve that minimizes the sum of the squared distances (also known as residuals) between the curve and the actual data points. Compared to the approach proposed by Boscovich, the least squares method is less robust to measurement errors and inconsistencies. However, from a computational point of view, it is more efficient and various algorithms exist for efficient calculation of curve parameters. This computational efficiency is crucial for modern data analysis, where datasets can be massive and complex, making least squares a fundamental tool in statistics and data analysis, offering a powerful and widely applicable approach to data fitting and model building.\nLegendre provided a rigorous mathematical foundation for the least squares method, demonstrating its theoretical underpinnings and proving its optimality under certain conditions. This mathematical basis helped establish the credibility and legitimacy of the method, paving the way for its wider acceptance and application. Legendre actively communicated his ideas and collaborated with other mathematicians, such as Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855), who also contributed significantly to the development of the least squares method. While evidence suggests Gauss used the least squares method as early as 1795, his formal publication came later than Legendre’s in 1809. Despite the delay in publication, Gauss independently discovered the method and applied it to various problems, including celestial mechanics and geodesy. He developed efficient computational methods for implementing the least squares method, making it accessible for practical use by scientists and engineers. While Legendre’s clear exposition and early publication brought the least squares method to the forefront, Gauss’s independent discovery, theoretical development, practical applications, and contributions to computational methods were equally crucial in establishing the method’s significance and impact. Both mathematicians played vital roles in shaping the least squares method into the powerful statistical tool it is today.\nAnother French polymath Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749-1827) extended the methods of Boscovich and showed that the curve fitting problem could be solved by ordering the candidate slopes and finding the weighted median. Besides that, Laplace made fundamental contributions to probability theory, developing the Bayesian approach to inference. Most of Laplace’s work was in the field of celestial mechanics, where he used data from astronomical observations to develop mathematical models and equations describing the gravitational interactions between celestial bodies. His analytical methods and use of observational data were pioneering in the field of celestial mechanics. Furthermore, he developed methods for estimating population parameters from samples, such as the mean and variance and pioneered the use of random sampling techniques, which are essential for ensuring the validity and generalizability of statistical inferences. These contributions helped lay the foundation for modern sampling theory and survey design, which are crucial for conducting reliable and representative studies. Overall, Laplace’s contributions to data analysis were profound and enduring. His work in probability theory, error analysis, sampling methods, and applications significantly advanced the field and laid the groundwork for modern statistical techniques. He also played a crucial role in promoting statistical education and communication, ensuring that these valuable tools were accessible and utilized across various disciplines.\nBoscovich used what we call today a linear regression analysis. This type of analysis relies on the assumption that the relationship between the independent (sine squared of the latitude) and dependent (arc length) variables is linear. Francis Galton was the person who coined the term “regression” in the context of statistics. One of the phenomena he studied was the relationship between the heights of parents and their children. He found that the heights of children tended to regress towards the average height of the population, which led him to use the term “regression” to describe this phenomenon. Galton promoted a data-driven approach to research that continues to shape statistical practice today. Furthermore, he introduced the concept of quantiles, which divide a population into equal-sized subpopulations based on a specific variable. This allowed for a more nuanced analysis of data compared to simply considering the mean and median. He also popularized the use of percentiles, which are specific quantiles used to express the proportion of a population below a certain value.\nGalton used regression analysis to show that the offspring of exceptionally large or small seed sizes of sweet peas tended to be closer to the average size. He also used it for family studies and investigated the inheritance of traits such as intelligence and talent. He used regression analysis to assess the degree to which these traits are passed down from parents to offspring.\nGalton’s overall approach to statistics was highly influential. He emphasized the importance of quantitative analysis, data-driven decision-making, and empirical research, which paved the way for modern statistical methods and helped to establish statistics as a recognized scientific discipline.\nThere are many modern applications of using data to solve problems. We will discuss one of them.\n“Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.” This observation opens Charles Mackay’s 1841 work Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, one of the earliest systematic examinations of collective human behavior. Yet just sixty-six years later, Francis Galton would document the opposite phenomenon: a crowd of nearly 800 people accurately estimating the weight of an ox to within 1% of its true value. How can crowds be both mad and wise? And what does this duality tell us about aggregating data and building intelligent systems?\nThe tension between collective wisdom and collective madness cuts to the heart of modern data science and artificial intelligence. When we combine multiple predictions, aggregate diverse data sources, or build ensemble models, we implicitly trust in the wisdom of aggregation. Yet history—from the Dutch tulip mania of 1637 to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s—reminds us that crowds can be spectacularly, catastrophically wrong. Understanding when and why crowds exhibit wisdom versus madness has profound implications for how we design AI systems, interpret market prices, and aggregate human judgment.",

    "text": "Historical Delusions and Economic Bubbles\nCharles Mackay’s Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds (Mackay 1841) chronicled three major categories of collective folly: economic manias, alchemical and prophetic delusions, and the social dynamics of witch hunts and fortune-telling. His most enduring contribution lies in documenting economic bubbles, particularly three spectacular episodes from the 17th and 18th centuries.\nThe Dutch tulip mania of 1636-1637 represents perhaps the purest example of speculative madness. At the height of the mania, single tulip bulbs sold for more than ten times the annual income of a skilled craftsman. A Semper Augustus bulb reportedly sold for 6,000 florins—enough to purchase one of the grandest houses on the most fashionable canal in Amsterdam. The market wasn’t driven by the intrinsic value of tulips or even their aesthetic beauty, but by the expectation that prices would continue rising. When the bubble inevitably collapsed in February 1637, fortunes vanished overnight, leaving behind ruined merchants and a cautionary tale about the dangers of collective speculation.\nThe South Sea Bubble of 1720 in England followed a similar trajectory but on a larger scale. The South Sea Company, granted a monopoly on trade with South America, saw its stock price rise from £128 in January to over £1,000 by August—despite generating minimal actual revenue from trade. The company’s success spawned a wave of similarly dubious ventures, including companies “for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.” When confidence finally broke, the collapse devastated the British economy and ruined thousands of investors, including Isaac Newton, who reportedly lamented, “I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.”\nThe Mississippi Scheme in France, orchestrated by Scottish financier John Law, created the third great bubble Mackay chronicled. Law convinced the French government to establish a national bank and a trading company with monopoly rights to develop French Louisiana. Through a complex scheme of debt conversion and money printing, Law inflated both the currency and company shares to unsustainable levels. When the bubble burst in 1720, it destroyed the French economy and created such trauma that France wouldn’t establish another national bank for decades.\nMackay’s analysis identified common patterns across these episodes:\n\nGradual inception: Bubbles begin with a kernel of truth—tulips were genuinely valuable, the South Sea Company did have a trade monopoly, Louisiana held economic potential.\nSocial contagion: As early investors profit, others join not from fundamental analysis but from observing their neighbors’ gains.\nSuspension of skepticism: Normal risk assessment breaks down as stories of easy wealth dominate rational calculation.\nNew era thinking: Participants convince themselves “this time is different,” that old rules no longer apply.\nCatastrophic collapse: Once confidence breaks, the crowd rushes for the exits, and prices collapse faster than they rose.\n\nWhile modern historians have questioned some of Mackay’s details—the tulip mania may have been less extreme and more localized than he portrayed—his central insight endures: crowds can synchronize on beliefs wildly divorced from reality, sustaining collective delusions until the inevitable reckoning.\n\n\nGalton’s Ox: The Wisdom of Aggregation\nFrancis Galton approached crowd behavior from a different angle. As we discussed earlier in this chapter, Galton pioneered quantitative approaches to inheritance, regression, and correlation. In 1907, he attended a livestock fair in Plymouth where nearly 800 people paid sixpence each to guess the dressed weight of an ox. The crowd included expert butchers and farmers as well as complete novices. After the competition, Galton obtained all the tickets and analyzed the distribution of guesses (Galton 1907).\nThe ox weighed 1,198 pounds when dressed. The median estimate from the crowd: 1,207 pounds—an error of less than 1%, or just 9 pounds. This remarkable accuracy led Galton to conclude that the result was “more creditable to the trustworthiness of a democratic judgment than might have been expected.”\nGalton’s statistical analysis revealed several fascinating patterns. The probable error of a single randomly selected estimate was ±37 pounds (about 3.1% of the true weight). Yet the median captured the true weight with far greater precision. The distribution wasn’t symmetric: estimates above the median had a quartile deviation of 45 pounds (3.7%), while estimates below deviated by only 29 pounds (2.4%). This asymmetry suggested systematic cognitive bias—people were more likely to overestimate than underestimate weight.\nThe middlemost 50% of estimates ranged from 1,178 to 1,252 pounds, a spread of 74 pounds around the true value. Galton observed that competitors appeared to “have erred normally in the first instance, and then to have magnified all errors that were negative and to have minified all those that were positive”—a remarkably prescient description of what modern psychologists would call anchoring and adjustment biases.\nWhat made the crowd wise? Several conditions aligned:\nIndependence: Each person wrote their estimate privately, without conferring. There was no oratory, no group discussion, no opportunity for social influence to create correlated errors.\nDiversity: The crowd mixed genuine experts (butchers who judged livestock daily) with laypeople relying on crude heuristics. This heterogeneity ensured errors weren’t systematically biased in the same direction.\nIncentive alignment: The sixpence fee deterred frivolous guesses (as Galton noted, it was “sufficiently high to prevent much ‘practical joking’”), while prizes motivated genuine effort.\nAppropriate aggregation: Galton chose the median rather than the mean, making the result robust to outliers and extreme estimates.\nThe experiment demonstrated a fundamental principle: aggregating diverse, independent estimates can produce accuracy exceeding individual expertise. No single person—not even the most experienced butcher—was as accurate as the median of the crowd. The collective judgment extracted signal from the noise of individual errors.\n\n\nSmart Money, Dumb Money: Learning from Crowds\nIf Galton showed how aggregation creates wisdom, Heaton and Polson’s 2012 paper reveals how it can perpetuate madness (Heaton and Polson 2012). Their work examines financial markets where two types of traders coexist: “smart money” who know true probabilities, and “dumb money” who hold systematically incorrect beliefs. Like in Galton’s ox-guessing crowd, market participants report their estimates by actively betting against each other, and prices reflect the proportion of money on each side—not a probability-weighted average of beliefs.\nSuppose an asset can default or not default. Smart money knows the true default probability is 30%, while dumb money believes it’s only 10%. If dumb money constitutes 45% of the market, they’ll bet heavily against default, placing 45% of total market capital on “no default.” Smart money, knowing default is more likely, bets the remaining 55% on default. The equilibrium price for “default” becomes 0.55—simply the proportion betting on that outcome—which overestimates the true 30% probability.\nThis creates systematic inefficiency. Dumb money consistently loses because they bet at unfavorable odds, while smart money earns predictable profits. Yet the market doesn’t naturally correct this imbalance. Smart money can’t arbitrage away all the mispricing because they have limited capital. The inefficiency persists. The central question is then Can dumb money learn from market prices that they are the dumb money?\nThis proves surprisingly difficult. When dumb money observes the market split 45-55, they know disagreement exists—but which side is which? Is the 45% minority the sophisticated insiders exploiting the 55% majority? Or is the 45% the naive crowd being taken advantage of by the 55%? The market price contains the information needed to identify one’s type, but that information is obscured by fundamental ambiguity about market composition. Heaton and Polson formalize this using Bayesian learning. The posterior odds that you’re dumb money equal: \\[\n\\frac{P(\\text{I am dumb money} \\mid \\text{price})}{P(\\text{I am smart money} \\mid \\text{price})} = \\frac{P(\\text{price} \\mid \\text{I am dumb money})}{P(\\text{price} \\mid \\text{I am smart money})} \\times \\frac{P(\\text{I am dumb money})}{P(\\text{I am smart money})}\n\\]\nLearning requires two conditions: (1) the likelihood ratio must favor being dumb money given the observed price, and (2) your prior must assign non-zero probability to being dumb. When smart and dumb money are equally balanced, the likelihood ratio equals 1. No amount of observation can update beliefs about one’s type. Paradoxically, increasing smart money toward this 50/50 balance might reduce market efficiency by making it harder for dumb money to learn.\nAs the authors note, “there is a sense in which the essence of being the dumb money is thinking too strongly that one is the smart money.” Learning requires assigning non-zero prior probability to being systematically wrong—a “psychologically difficult self-evaluation” that may be precisely what defines dumb money. Overconfidence isn’t just a symptom of being dumb money; it’s what prevents learning that one is dumb money.\nEven if dumb money suspects they might be wrong, they must accurately estimate the proportion of dumb money in the market. But identifying market composition is notoriously difficult. During the dot-com bubble, for instance, dumb money “had been laughing all the way to the bank”—their short-term success reinforced confidence that they were actually the smart money.\nEven if dumb money concludes they’re probably dumb money, learning must be strong enough to reverse their position. Merely adjusting beliefs slightly won’t change which side of the bet appears attractive. The paper illuminates why certain markets remain persistently inefficient. It’s not just that dumb money exists, but that dumb money cannot learn it is dumb money. The very characteristics that make someone dumb money—overconfidence, poor base rate estimation, unwillingness to question fundamental assumptions—are precisely those that prevent self-correction.\nThe authors cite the 2008 financial crisis as a real-world example. A handful of hedge funds bet against subprime mortgages at extremely favorable odds. As Michael Lewis documented in The Big Short, the constraint wasn’t demand for the bet—smart money was willing—but supply. Finding enough counterparties willing to take the other side proved difficult. Yet even as the crisis unfolded, many “dumb money” participants couldn’t learn their type until catastrophic losses forced the realization.\nThe contrast between Galton’s wise crowd and Heaton and Polson’s mad market reveals critical lessons for building intelligent systems. Galton’s ox-guessing competition succeeded because it created ideal conditions for wisdom:\nStatistical independence: Errors weren’t correlated. When one person overestimated, another’s underestimate balanced it out. This is why ensemble machine learning methods work: combining independent models reduces variance while preserving low bias. Random forests, for instance, decorrelate decision trees by training on random subsets of data and features, ensuring individual tree errors don’t reinforce each other.\nDiversity of approach: The crowd used heterogeneous methods—some people estimated volume then converted to weight, others compared to familiar animals, butchers relied on professional experience. This diversity ensured systematic biases in one approach were offset by different biases in another. Similarly, ensemble methods benefit from combining fundamentally different model types (e.g., neural networks, tree-based models, and linear models) rather than multiple instances of the same architecture.\nAppropriate aggregation: Galton used the median, which is robust to outliers. In modern ensemble methods, we similarly choose aggregation schemes carefully: majority voting for classification, median or trimmed mean for regression, weighted combinations based on confidence. The aggregation method matters as much as the individual models.\nNo strategic interaction: Participants weren’t betting against each other or trying to exploit others’ mistakes. Each estimate represented genuine belief. This differs fundamentally from adversarial settings where agents game the system.\nHeaton and Polson’s market differs on crucial dimensions:\nSystematic subgroup bias: Dumb money isn’t randomly wrong—they’re systematically wrong in the same direction. Aggregating their bets doesn’t cancel errors; it embeds bias in prices. In machine learning, if multiple models share the same systematic bias (say, all trained on biased data), ensembling won’t fix the problem. Voting among biased models just entrenches the bias.\nStrategic interaction: Market participants bet against each other. Prices reflect not just beliefs but capital constraints and risk appetite. Smart money can’t arbitrage away all inefficiency. Similarly, in adversarial machine learning settings (spam detection, fraud detection, adversarial attacks on neural networks), the presence of strategic agents fundamentally changes aggregation dynamics.\nCircular inference: Prices reflect participants’ own bets, creating a circularity: dumb money observes prices that partially reflect their own behavior and must infer whether they’re on the right or wrong side. In machine learning, this resembles the challenge of training on data that includes your model’s own predictions—a form of feedback loop that can amplify rather than correct errors.\nBarriers to self-correction: Dumb money cannot learn its type without assigning prior probability to being wrong and accurately estimating market composition. In machine learning, this parallels the challenge of model selection uncertainty: an algorithm must know which class of model is appropriate before it can learn parameters. Choosing the wrong model class can be more damaging than getting parameters slightly wrong.\n\nDesigning Robust AI Systems\nThese lessons suggest several principles for building intelligent systems. Independence is important. Training on different data subsets through bagging creates independence by ensuring each model sees a different sample of the data. Using different features, as in random forests, prevents models from making identical mistakes based on the same input patterns. Employing different algorithms through stacking combines fundamentally different approaches to the same problem. Adding noise through techniques like dropout and data augmentation decorrelates errors by introducing controlled randomness that prevents models from overfitting to identical patterns.\nCalibrate confidence: Overconfidence is as dangerous in AI as in markets. Dumb money thinks it’s smart money; overfit models are “confident but wrong.” Calibration—ensuring predicted probabilities match actual frequencies—helps prevent this. Techniques like temperature scaling, Platt scaling, and isotonic regression adjust model confidence to better reflect true uncertainty.\nAvoid feedback loops: Be cautious when models influence the data they’ll later train on. This occurs in recommender systems, where showing users content based on past behavior creates training data from that very behavior. Financial trading algorithms face similar challenges when their price predictions actually affect market prices. Search engines encounter this when their ranking algorithms influence user clicks, which then become training data for future ranking decisions. Content moderation systems create feedback loops when automated decisions generate the training data for future automation, potentially amplifying initial biases or errors.\nProvide unambiguous feedback: Unlike markets where feedback is delayed and noisy, AI systems should enable rapid, clear feedback about prediction quality. This accelerates learning and prevents prolonged periods of confident incorrectness.\n\n\nThe Bias-Variance Tradeoff Revisited\nGalton’s experiment beautifully illustrates the bias-variance tradeoff. Individual estimates had high variance (probable error of 3.1%) but low bias (median off by only 0.8%). The median reduced variance dramatically while preserving the low bias—a core principle in statistical learning.\nEnsemble methods exploit the same principle. If individual models have low bias but high variance, averaging reduces variance without increasing bias. This explains why bagging (bootstrap aggregating) works so well: by training multiple models on random data subsets, we create high-variance predictors whose errors largely cancel when averaged.\nHowever, if models have systematic bias, averaging won’t help—it may even hurt. If all models in an ensemble underestimate values for a particular subgroup (perhaps due to underrepresentation in training data), taking their average still underestimates. This is the “dumb money” problem: when errors are correlated and biased in the same direction, aggregation entrenches rather than eliminates the problem.\n\n\nInformation Markets and Prediction Platforms\nModern prediction markets attempt to harness Galton’s wisdom while avoiding Heaton and Polson’s madness. Platforms like Metaculus, Good Judgment Open, and Manifold Markets aggregate forecasts from diverse participants to predict future events—from election outcomes to technological breakthroughs.\nThese platforms implement several design principles to promote wisdom over madness:\nProper scoring rules: Participants are rewarded for accuracy, not just correct predictions. The Brier score, for instance, penalizes both overconfidence and underconfidence, incentivizing honest reporting of beliefs rather than strategic betting.\nReputation systems: Track forecaster accuracy over time, weighting predictions by historical performance. This effectively filters out “dumb money” by giving less influence to consistently poor predictors.\nExtremization: Research by Tetlock and others shows that aggregated predictions often benefit from “extremizing”—adjusting the consensus forecast away from 50% toward the extremes. If the average forecast is 70%, adjusting to 75% often improves accuracy. This suggests crowds are sometimes too cautious, insufficiently updating on shared information.\nTransparency: Display the distribution of forecasts, not just the median. This reveals when consensus is strong versus when the crowd is divided, providing information about uncertainty in the aggregate.\nIncentive alignment: Some platforms use real money (prediction markets), while others use reputation points or tournament prizes. The key is creating genuine incentive to be accurate rather than to follow the crowd or game the system.\nEarly evidence suggests these platforms can achieve impressive accuracy. Before the 2020 U.S. presidential election, prediction markets aggregated thousands of bets to estimate Biden’s probability of victory at around 60-70%, roughly matching sophisticated polling models. During the COVID-19 pandemic, forecasting platforms predicted vaccine development timelines more accurately than many expert committees. The success of these platforms validates Galton’s core insight: properly aggregated diverse judgments can rival or exceed expert predictions.\nThe arc from Mackay through Galton to Heaton and Polson traces the evolution of our understanding of collective intelligence. Mackay warned that crowds “go mad in herds,” documenting the catastrophic consequences of synchronized delusion. Galton demonstrated that crowds can extract wisdom from noise through proper aggregation of independent judgments. Heaton and Polson revealed the subtle conditions under which madness persists—when systematic bias, strategic interaction, and barriers to learning prevent self-correction.\nFor AI and machine learning, these lessons are foundational. Every ensemble method, every data aggregation scheme, every model averaging technique implicitly bets on the wisdom of aggregation. But wisdom isn’t automatic—it emerges from independence, diversity, appropriate aggregation methods, and absence of systematic bias. When these conditions fail, we get not intelligence but amplified error: overfit models that are confident but wrong, biased algorithms that entrench inequality, feedback loops that amplify rather than correct mistakes.\nThe unreasonable effectiveness of data depends not just on having more data, but on aggregating it wisely. As we build increasingly sophisticated AI systems that combine multiple models, integrate diverse data sources, and make consequential decisions, the distinction between wisdom and madness—between Galton’s ox and Mackay’s tulips—becomes ever more critical. The crowds we build into our algorithms must be wise ones, designed with intention to harness collective intelligence while guarding against collective delusion.\n\n\n\n\nAltić, Mirela Slukan. 2013. “Exploring Along the Rome Meridian: Roger Boscovich and the First Modern Map of the Papal States.” In History of Cartography: International Symposium of the ICA, 2012, 71–89.

    "text": "11.1 Why Pattern Matching?\n“Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future.” Niels Bohr, Danish physicist and Nobel laureate\nThe history of data analysis is closely intertwined with the development of pattern matching techniques. The ability to identify and understand patterns in data has been crucial for scientific discoveries, technological advancements, and decision-making. From the early days of astronomy to modern machine learning, pattern matching has played a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of the world around us. This chapter explores the key concepts of pattern matching, its historical development, and its impact on data analysis.\nData science involves two major steps: collection and cleaning of data and building a model or applying an algorithm. In this chapter we present the process of building predictive models. To illustrate the process, think of your data as being generated by a black box in which a set of input variables \\(x\\) go through the box and generate an output variable \\(y\\).\nFor Gauss, Laplace, and many other scientists, the central challenge was estimating parameters when the functional form of the relationship was already known—often linear (as in the Earth-shape example) or multiplicative (e.g., Newton’s \\(F=ma\\)). In many modern problems, however, the relationship itself is unknown and defies simple mathematical description; human behaviour and natural language are prominent examples (Halevy, Norvig, and Pereira (2009)).\nIn such cases a pattern-matching approach can uncover the hidden relationships directly from data. Pattern matching means identifying recurring sequences, relationships, or structures within a dataset—much like finding a puzzle piece that completes a picture. Recognising these patterns yields insights, reveals trends, supports prediction, and ultimately improves decisions. Initial pattern-matching studies have often sparked major scientific advances, as the early history of mammography illustrates.",

    "text": "Example 11.1 (Mammography and Early Pattern Matching) The use of mammograms for breast cancer detection relied on simple pattern matching in its initial stages. Radiologists visually examined the X-ray images for specific patterns indicative of cancer, such as dense areas of tissue appearing different from surrounding breast tissue (masses) and small white spots of calcium deposits called microcalcifications. These patterns were associated with early-stage cancer and could be easily missed by visual inspection alone.\nRadiologists relied on their expertise and experience to identify these patterns and distinguish them from normal breast tissue variations. This process was subjective and prone to errors, particularly with subtle abnormalities or in dense breasts. Subtle abnormalities, especially in dense breasts, could be easily missed using visual assessment alone. Despite these limitations, pattern matching played a crucial role in the early detection of breast cancer, saving countless lives. It served as the foundation for mammography as a screening tool.\nAlbert Solomon, a German surgeon, played a pivotal role in the early development of mammography (Nicosia et al. (2023)). His most significant contribution was his 1913 monograph, “Beitr{\"a}ge zur Pathologie und Klinik der Mammakarzinome” (Contributions to the Pathology and Clinic of Breast Cancers). In this work, he demonstrated the potential of X-ray imaging for studying breast disease. He pioneered the use of X-rays, he compared surgically removed breast tissue images with the actual tissue and was able to identify characteristic features of cancerous tumors, such as their size, shape, and borders. He was one of the first to recognize the association between small calcifications appearing on X-rays and breast cancer.\nThe presence of calcium deposits is correlated with breast cancer and is still a prevailing imaging biomarker for its detection. Although the discovery of the deposit-cancer association induced scientific discoveries, the molecular mechanisms that lead to the formation of these calcium deposits, as well as the significance of their presence in human tissues, have not been completely understood (Bonfiglio et al. (2021)).\n\n\nRichard Feynman on Pattern Matching and Chess\nRichard Feynman, the renowned physicist, was a strong advocate for the importance of pattern matching and its role in learning and problem-solving. He argued that many scientific discoveries start with pattern matching. He emphasized that experts in any field, whether it’s chess, science, or art, develop a strong ability to identify and understand relevant patterns in their respective domains.\nHe often used the example of chess to illustrate this concept (Feynman (n.d.)). Feynman argued that a skilled chess player doesn’t consciously calculate every possible move. Instead, they recognize patterns on the board and understand the potential consequences of their actions. For example, a chess player might recognize that having a knight in a certain position is advantageous and will lead to a favorable outcome. This ability to identify and understand patterns allows them to make quick and accurate decisions during the game. Through playing and analyzing chess games, players develop mental models that represent their understanding of the game’s rules, strategies, and potential patterns. These mental models allow them to anticipate their opponent’s moves and formulate effective responses.\nHe emphasized that this skill could be transferred to other domains, such as scientific research, engineering, and even everyday problem-solving.\nHere is a quote from his interview:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRichard Feynman\n\n\n\nLet’s say a chess game. And you don’t know the rules of the game, but you’re allowed to look at the board from time to time, in a little corner, perhaps. And from these observations, you try to figure out what the rules are of the game, what [are] the rules of the pieces moving.\nYou might discover after a bit, for example, that when there’s only one bishop around on the board, that the bishop maintains its color. Later on you might discover the law for the bishop is that it moves on a diagonal, which would explain the law that you understood before, that it maintains its color. And that would be analogous we discover one law and later find a deeper understanding of it.\nAh, then things can happen–everything’s going good, you’ve got all the laws, it looks very good–and then all of a sudden some strange phenomenon occurs in some corner, so you begin to investigate that, to look for it. It’s castling–something you didn’t expect…\nAfter you’ve noticed that the bishops maintain their color and that they go along on the diagonals and so on, for such a long time, and everybody knows that that’s true; then you suddenly discover one day in some chess game that the bishop doesn’t maintain its color, it changes its color. Only later do you discover the new possibility that the bishop is captured and that a pawn went all the way down to the queen’s end to produce a new bishop. That could happen, but you didn’t know it.\n\n\nIn an interview on Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), he compares human and machine intelligence:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRichard Feynman\n\n\n\nFirst of all, do they think like human beings? I would say no and I’ll explain in a minute why I say no. Second, for “whether they be more intelligent than human beings: to be a question, intelligence must first be defined. If you were to ask me are they better chess players than any human being? Possibly can be, yes,”I’ll get you some day”. They’re better chess players than most human beings right now!\n\n\nBy 1996, computers had become stronger than grandmasters. With the advent of deep neural networks in 2002, Stockfish 15 is way stronger. A turning point on our understanding of AI algorithms was AlphaZero and chess.\nAlphaGo coupled with deep neural networks and Monte Carlo simulation provided a gold standard for chess. AlphaZero showed that neural networks can self-learn by competing against itself. Neural networks are used to pattern match and interpolate both the policy and value function. This implicitly performs “feature selection”. Whilst humans have heuristics for features in chess, such as control center, king safety and piece development, AlphaZero “learns” from experience. With a goal of maximizing the probability of winning, neural networks have a preference for initiative, speed and momentum and space over minor material such as pawns. Thus reviving the old school romantic chess play.\nFeynman discusses how machines show intelligence:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRichard Feynman\n\n\n\nWith regard to the question of whether we can make it to think like [human beings], my opinion is based on the following idea: That we try to make these things work as efficiently as we can with the materials that we have. Materials are different than nerves, and so on. If we would like to make something that runs rapidly over the ground, then we could watch a cheetah running, and we could try to make a machine that runs like a cheetah. But, it’s easier to make a machine with wheels. With fast wheels or something that flies just above the ground in the air. When we make a bird, the airplanes don’t fly like a bird, they fly but they don’t fly like a bird, okay? They don’t flap their wings exactly, they have in front, another gadget that goes around, or the more modern airplane has a tube that you heat the air and squirt it out the back, a jet propulsion, a jet engine, has internal rotating fans and so on, and uses gasoline. It’s different, right?\nSo, there’s no question that the later machines are not going to think like people think, in that sense. With regard to intelligence, I think it’s exactly the same way, for example they’re not going to do arithmetic the same way as we do arithmetic, but they’ll do it better.\n\n\nBoth of us happen to know Beatrice Rana, a professional pianist. During one of our discussions she compared modern AI systems to produce incredible results to a pianist capable of remembering and reproducing complex pieces of music. She called it “intelligenza artigiana”, the intelligence of hands.",

    "text": "11.2 Unsupervised Learning\nPrediction and forecasting is the most frequent problem in data analysis and the most common approach to solve the prediction problem is via pattern matching. Prediction and forecasting are two closely related concepts that are often used interchangeably. In business and engineering the main motivation for prediction and forecasting is to make better decisions. In science, the main motivation is to test and validate theories.\nPrediction and forecasting help to identify trends and patterns in historical data that would otherwise remain hidden. This allows analysts to make informed decisions about the future based on what they know about the past. By using prediction models, analysts can identify potential risks and opportunities that may lie ahead. This information can then be used to develop proactive strategies to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities.\nIn many business applications the concern is improving efficiency of a system. For example to improve logistic chains and to optimally allocate resources, we need to forecast demand and supply and to predict the future prices of the resources. By predicting future sales, businesses can better plan their marketing and sales efforts. This can lead to increased sales and profitability. Prediction and forecasting can be used to identify and mitigate potential risks, such as financial losses, supply chain disruptions, and operational failures.\nBelow we provide an example of an unsupervised learning approach to forecasting. Formally, unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is not provided with labeled data. The goal is to find patterns in the data without any prior knowledge of the structure of the data. In the example below we use the 2012 US presidential election data to forecast the probability of Obama winning the election.\n\nExample 11.2 (Obama Elections) This example demonstrates a Bayesian approach to election forecasting using polling data from the 2012 US presidential election. The goal is to predict the probability of Barack Obama winning the election by combining polling data across different states.\nThe data used includes polling data from various pollsters across all 50 states plus DC. Each state has polling percentages for Republican (GOP) and Democratic (Dem) candidates along with their electoral vote counts. The data is aggregated by state, taking the most recent polls available.\nThe techniques applied involve Bayesian simulation using a Dirichlet distribution to model uncertainty in polling percentages. Monte Carlo simulation runs 10,000 simulations of the election to estimate win probabilities. The analysis is conducted state-by-state, calculating Obama’s probability of winning each individual state. Electoral college modeling combines state probabilities with electoral vote counts to determine the overall election outcome. The simulation runs the entire election multiple times to account for uncertainty and determines the likelihood of Obama reaching the required 270 electoral votes to win. This approach demonstrates how pattern matching through statistical modeling can be used for prediction, showing how polling data can be transformed into probabilistic forecasts of election outcomes.\nWe start by loading the data and aggregating it by state.\n\nlibrary(plyr)\n# Source: \"http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2012/Pres/pres_polls.csv\"\nelection.2012 = read.csv(\"../data/pres_polls.csv\")\n# Remove a pollster: elect2012 &lt;- election.2012[!grepl('Rasmussen', election.2012$Pollster),]\nelect2012 &lt;- election.2012\n# Aggregrate the data\nelect2012 &lt;- ddply(elect2012, .(state), subset, Day == max(Day))\nelect2012 &lt;- ddply(elect2012, .(state), summarise, R.pct = mean(GOP), O.pct = mean(Dem), EV = mean(EV))\n\nknitr::kable(elect2012[1:25,], caption = \"Election 2012 Data\",longtable=TRUE)\nknitr::kable(elect2012[26:51,], caption = \"Election 2012 Data\",longtable=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nElection 2012 Data\n\n\nstate\nR.pct\nO.pct\nEV\n\n\n\n\nAlabama\n61\n38\n9\n\n\nAlaska\n55\n42\n3\n\n\nArizona\n54\n44\n11\n\n\nArkansas\n61\n37\n6\n\n\nCalifornia\n38\n59\n55\n\n\nColorado\n47\n51\n9\n\n\nConnecticut\n40\n58\n7\n\n\nD.C.\n7\n91\n3\n\n\nDelaware\n40\n59\n3\n\n\nFlorida\n49\n50\n29\n\n\nGeorgia\n53\n45\n16\n\n\nHawaii\n28\n71\n4\n\n\nIdaho\n65\n33\n4\n\n\nIllinois\n41\n57\n20\n\n\nIndiana\n54\n44\n11\n\n\nIowa\n47\n52\n6\n\n\nKansas\n60\n38\n6\n\n\nKentucky\n61\n38\n8\n\n\nLouisiana\n58\n41\n8\n\n\nMaine\n41\n56\n4\n\n\nMaryland\n37\n62\n10\n\n\nMassachusetts\n38\n61\n11\n\n\nMichigan\n45\n54\n16\n\n\nMinnesota\n45\n53\n10\n\n\nMississippi\n56\n44\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElection 2012 Data\n\n\n\nstate\nR.pct\nO.pct\nEV\n\n\n\n\n26\nMissouri\n54\n44\n10\n\n\n27\nMontana\n55\n41\n3\n\n\n28\nNebraska\n61\n38\n5\n\n\n29\nNevada\n46\n52\n6\n\n\n30\nNew Hampshire\n46\n52\n4\n\n\n31\nNew Jersey\n41\n58\n14\n\n\n32\nNew Mexico\n43\n53\n5\n\n\n33\nNew York\n36\n63\n29\n\n\n34\nNorth Carolina\n51\n48\n15\n\n\n35\nNorth Dakota\n59\n39\n3\n\n\n36\nOhio\n48\n50\n18\n\n\n37\nOklahoma\n67\n33\n7\n\n\n38\nOregon\n43\n54\n7\n\n\n39\nPennsylvania\n47\n52\n20\n\n\n40\nRhode Island\n36\n63\n4\n\n\n41\nSouth Carolina\n55\n44\n9\n\n\n42\nSouth Dakota\n58\n40\n3\n\n\n43\nTennessee\n60\n39\n11\n\n\n44\nTexas\n57\n41\n38\n\n\n45\nUtah\n73\n25\n6\n\n\n46\nVermont\n31\n67\n3\n\n\n47\nVirginia\n48\n51\n13\n\n\n48\nWashington\n42\n56\n12\n\n\n49\nWest Virginia\n62\n36\n5\n\n\n50\nWisconsin\n46\n53\n10\n\n\n51\nWyoming\n69\n28\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then run the simulation and plot probabilities by state.\n\nlibrary(MCMCpack)\nprob.Obama &lt;- function(mydata) {\n    p &lt;- rdirichlet(1000, 500 * c(mydata$R.pct, mydata$O.pct, 100 - mydata$R.pct - \n        mydata$O.pct)/100 + 1)\n    mean(p[, 2] &gt; p[, 1])\n}\nwin.probs &lt;- ddply(elect2012, .(state), prob.Obama)\nwin.probs$Romney &lt;- 1 - win.probs$V1\nnames(win.probs)[2] &lt;- \"Obama\"\nwin.probs$EV &lt;- elect2012$EV\nwin.probs &lt;- win.probs[order(win.probs$EV), ]\nrownames(win.probs) &lt;- win.probs$state\n\nWe then plot the probabilities of Obama winning by state.\n\nlibrary(usmap)\nplot_usmap(data = win.probs, values = \"Obama\") + \n  scale_fill_continuous(low = \"red\", high = \"blue\", name = \"Obama Win Probability\", label = scales::comma) + theme(legend.position = \"right\")\n\n\n\n\nProbabilities of Obama winning by state\n\n\n\n\nWe use those probabilities to simulate the probability of Obama winning the election.

The actual result of 365 electoral votes falls within the simulated range, demonstrating the model’s validity. The 270-vote threshold needed to win the presidency is clearly marked and serves as a critical reference point.\nWe used a relatively simple model to simulate the election outcome. The model uses Dirichlet distributions to capture uncertainty in state-level polling percentages. Obama’s win probabilities vary significantly across states, reflecting the competitive nature of the election. The simulation approach accounts for both sampling uncertainty and the discrete nature of electoral vote allocation. The histogram of simulated results shows the distribution of possible outcomes. The actual Obama total of 365 electoral votes is marked and falls within the reasonable range of simulated outcomes. This validates the probabilistic approach to election forecasting.\nThis analysis demonstrates how Bayesian methods can be effectively applied to complex prediction problems with multiple sources of uncertainty, providing both point estimates and measures of uncertainty around those estimates.",

    "text": "11.3 Supervised Learning\nThe problem of supervised learning is to learn patterns from observed data to make predictions on new, unseen data. The key idea is that we have input-output pairs \\((x_i, y_i)\\) where we know the correct output \\(y_i\\) for each input \\(x_i\\), and we use these examples to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs.\nSupervised learning has become ubiquitous across modern engineering, business, and technology applications. In manufacturing, predictive maintenance systems use sensor data from industrial equipment to forecast potential failures, enabling proactive maintenance that reduces downtime and costs. Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on supervised learning for object detection, lane recognition, and decision-making systems that process real-time sensor data from cameras, LiDAR, and radar. In healthcare, supervised learning powers diagnostic imaging systems that can detect diseases from X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans with accuracy rivaling human radiologists.\nFinancial institutions employ supervised learning for fraud detection, credit scoring, and algorithmic trading systems that analyze vast amounts of transaction data. Smart cities utilize supervised learning for traffic flow optimization, energy consumption forecasting, and air quality monitoring. Many companies use prediction models for customer churn, helping identify early warning signs of dissatisfaction. Marketing teams leverage supervised learning for customer segmentation, campaign optimization, and lead scoring to improve conversion rates. Supply chain optimization uses supervised learning to forecast demand, optimize inventory levels, and predict delivery times. These applications demonstrate how supervised learning has evolved from simple prediction tasks to complex, real-time decision-making systems that operate across diverse domains.\nA typical prediction problem involves building a rule that maps observed inputs \\(x\\) into the output \\(y\\). The inputs \\(x\\) are often called predictors, features, or independent variables, while the output \\(y\\) is often called the response or dependent variable. The goal is to find a predictive rule \\[\ny = f(x).\n\\]\nThe map \\(f\\) can be viewed as a black box which describes how to find the output \\(y\\) from the input \\(x\\). One of the key requirements of \\(f\\) is that we should be able to efficiently find this function using an algorithm. In the simple case \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) are both univariate (scalars) and we can view the map as\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR\n    x --&gt; f((f))\n    f --&gt; y\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of machine learning is to reconstruct this map from observed data. In a multivariate setting \\(x = (x_1,\\ldots,x_p)\\) is a list of \\(p\\) variables. This leads to a model of the form \\(y = f(x_1,\\ldots,x_p)\\). There are a number of possible goals of analysis, such as estimation, inference or prediction. The main one being prediction.\nThe prediction task is to calculate a response that corresponds to a new feature input variable. An example of inference is the task of establishing causation, with the goal of extracting information about the nature of the black box association of the response variable to the input variables.\nIn either case, the goal is to use data to find a pattern that we can exploit. The pattern will be “statistical” in its nature. To uncover the pattern we use a training dataset, denoted by \\[\nD = (y_i,x_i)_{i=1}^n\n\\]\nwhere \\(x_i\\) is a set of \\(p\\) predictors and \\(y_i\\) is response variable. Prediction problem is to use a training dataset \\(D\\) to design a rule that can be used for predicting output values \\(y\\) for new observations \\(x\\).\nLet \\(f(x)\\) be predictor of \\(y\\), we will use notation \\[\n\\hat{y} = f(x).\n\\]\nTo summarize, we will use the following notation.\n\n\n\n\\(y\\)\noutput variable (response/outcome)\n\n\n\\(x\\)\ninput variable (predictor/covariate/feature)\n\n\n\\(f(x)\\)\npredictive rule\n\n\n\\(\\hat y\\)\npredicted output value\n\n\n\nWe distinguish several types of input or output variables. First, binary variables that can only have two possible values, e.g. yes/no, left/right, 0/1, up/down, etc. A generalization of binary variable is a categorical variable that can take a fixed number of possible values, for example, marriage status. Additionally, some of the categorical variable can have a natural order to them, for example education level or salary range. Those variables are called ordinal. Lastly, the most common type of a variable is quantitative which is described by a real number.\nDepending on the type of the output variable, there are three types of prediction problems.\n\nTypes of output variables and corresponding prediction problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput Variable Type\nDescription\nPrediction Problem\n\n\n\n\nBinary\n\\(y\\in \\{0,1\\}\\)\nClassification\n\n\nCategorical\n\\(y\\in \\{0,\\ldots,K\\}\\) for \\(K\\) possible categories\nClassification\n\n\nQuantitative\n\\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) (any real number)\nRegression\n\n\nOrdinal\n\\(y\\) has natural ordering\nRanking\n\n\n\nHere are some examples of prediction problems:\nBinary Classification: Predicting whether an email is spam or not spam involves input variables such as email content, sender information, presence of certain keywords, and email length. The output variable is \\(y \\in \\{0,1\\}\\) where 0 = not spam, 1 = spam. The goal is to classify new emails as spam or legitimate.\nCategorical Classification: Predicting the type of social media content based on text and image features uses input variables including text content, image features, user engagement metrics, posting time, and hashtags. The output variable is \\(y \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}\\) where 0 = news, 1 = entertainment, 2 = educational, 3 = promotional, 4 = personal. The goal is to automatically categorize social media posts for content moderation and recommendation systems.\nRegression (Quantitative): Predicting house prices based on features uses input variables such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, age of house, and lot size. The output variable is \\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) (house price in dollars). The goal is to predict the selling price of a new house.\nRanking (Ordinal): Predicting customer satisfaction ratings involves input variables including product quality, customer service experience, delivery time, and price. The output variable is \\(y \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}\\) where 1 = very dissatisfied, 5 = very satisfied. The goal is to predict customer satisfaction level for new customers.\nThere are several simple predictive rules we can use to predict the output variable \\(y\\). For example, in the case of regression problem, the simplest rule is to predict the average value of the output variable. This rule is called the mean rule and is defined as \\[\n\\hat f(x) = \\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i.\n\\]\nNotice, this model does not depend on the input variable \\(x\\) and will predict the same value for all observations. This rule is simple and easy to implement, but it is not very accurate. In case of binary \\(y\\), we can apply thresholding to the mean rule to obtain a binary classifier. \\[\nf(x) = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } \\bar{y} &gt; 0.5, \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } \\bar{y} \\leq 0.5.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nA more sophisticated rule is the nearest neighbor rule. This rule predicts the output value \\(y\\) for a new observation \\(x\\) by finding the closest observation in the training dataset and using its output value. The nearest neighbor rule is defined as \\[\nf(x) = y_{i^*},\n\\] where \\[i^* = \\arg\\min_{i=1,\\ldots,n} \\|x_i - x\\|\\] is the index of the closest observation in the training dataset. These two models represent two extreme cases of predictive rules: the mean rule is “stubborn” (it always predicts the same value) and the nearest neighbor rule is “flexible” (can be very sensitive to small changes in the inputs). Using the language of statistics the mean rule is of high bias and low variance, while the nearest neighbor rule is of low bias and high variance. Although those two rules are simple, they sometimes lead to useful models that can be used in practice. Further, those two models represent a trade-off between accuracy and complexity (the bias-variance trade-off). We will discuss this trade-off in more detail in the later section.\nThe mean model and nearest neighbor model belong to a class of so-called non-parametric models. The non-parametric models do not make explicit assumption about the form of the function \\(f(x)\\). In contrast, parametric models assume that the predictive rule \\(f(x)\\) is a specific function defined by vector of parameters, which we will denote as \\(\\theta\\). A typical notation is then \\[\nf_{\\theta}(x).\n\\]\nTraditional modeling culture employs statistical models characterized by single-layer transformations, where the relationship between input variables and output is modeled through direct, interpretable mathematical formulations. These approaches typically involve linear combinations, additive structures, or simple nonlinear transformations that maintain analytical tractability and statistical interpretability. The list of widely used models includes:\n\n\n\nTable 11.1: Traditional statistical models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\nFormula\nParameters\n\n\n\n\nLinear Regression\n\\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\ldots + \\beta_p x_p\\)\n\\(\\theta = (\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_p)\\)\n\n\nGeneralized Linear Model (GLM)\n\\(y = f^{-1}(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\ldots + \\beta_p x_p)\\)\n\\(\\theta = (\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_p)\\)\n\n\nGeneralized Additive Model (GAM)\n\\(y = \\beta_0 + f_1(x_1) + \\ldots + f_k(x_k)\\)\n\\(\\theta = (\\beta_0, f_1, \\ldots, f_k)\\)\n\n\nPrincipal Component Regression (PCR)\n\\(y = \\beta^T (W x),\\quad W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times p},\\ k &lt; p\\)\n\\(\\theta = (\\beta, W)\\)\n\n\nSliced Inverse Regression (SIR)\n\\(y = f(\\beta_1^T x,\\, \\beta_2^T x,\\, \\ldots,\\, \\beta_k^T x,\\, \\epsilon)\\)\n\\(\\theta = (\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\ldots, \\beta_k)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast to these traditional single-layer approaches, Deep Learning employs sophisticated high-dimensional multi-layer neural network architectures that can capture complex, non-linear relationships in data through hierarchical feature learning. Each layer transforms the input data by applying an affine transformation and a non-linear activation function. The depth and complexity of these architectures allow deep learning models to automatically discover intricate patterns and representations from raw input data, making them particularly effective for tasks involving high-dimensional inputs such as image recognition, natural language processing, and complex time series analysis. Unlike traditional statistical models that rely on hand-crafted features, deep learning models learn hierarchical representations directly from the data, with early layers capturing simple features (like edges in images) and deeper layers combining these into more complex, abstract representations.\nWe wish to find map \\(f\\) such that \\[\\begin{align*}\ny &= f ( x ) \\\\\ny &=  f ( x_1 , \\ldots , x _p )\n\\end{align*}\\]\nEssentially, the goal is to perform the pattern matching, also known as nonparametric regression. It involves finding complex relationships in data without assuming a specific functional form. In deep learning, we use composite functions rather than additive functions. We write the superposition of univariate functions as \\[\nf = f_1 \\circ \\ldots \\circ f_L   \\; \\; \\text{versus}  \\; \\; f_1 +  \\ldots + f_L\n\\] where the composition of functions creates a hierarchical structure. Each function \\(f_i\\) is a combination of a linear transformation and a non-linear activation function \\[\nf_i(x) = \\sigma(W_i x + b_i),\n\\] The composition of functions creates a hierarchical structure. Then the set of parameters that we need to find is \\(\\theta = (W_1, b_1, \\ldots, W_L, b_L)\\).",

    "section": "11.4 Model Estimation",
    "text": "11.4 Model Estimation\nThere are two main approaches to finding the set of parameters \\(\\theta\\). The first is optimization approach that minimizes a loss function. Loss function measures how well predictive rule \\(f\\) captures the relationship between input and output variables. The most common loss function is the mean squared error (MSE). The second approach is to use full Bayesian inference and to calculate the distribution over parameter \\(\\theta\\) given the observed data.\nBoth approaches start with formulating likelihood function. Likelihood is a function that tells us how probable the observed data is, given a particular value of the parameter in a statistical model. It is not the same as probability; instead, it’s a function of the parameter, with the data fixed. Suppose you flip a biased coin 10 times and get 7 heads. You want to estimate the probability of getting heads on a single toss. You try different values of \\(\\theta\\) and ask: “How likely is it to get exactly 7 heads out of 10 flips if the true probability is \\(\\theta\\)?” This leads to the likelihood function. Formally, given \\(y_i \\sim f(y_i\\mid x_i,  \\theta)\\): iid samples from a distribution with parameter \\(\\theta\\), the likelihood function is defined as \\[\nL(\\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n p(y_i\\mid x_i,  \\theta).\n\\] It treats the data \\(D = (y_i,x_i)_{i=1}^n\\) as fixed and varies \\(\\theta\\).\nLikelihood connects our model to the data generating process by quantifying how likely it is to observe the actual data we have under different parameter values. For example, if we assume our data follows a normal distribution \\(y \\sim N(f_\\theta(x), \\sigma^2)\\) with mean \\(f_\\theta(x)\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), the likelihood function would be:\n\\[\nL(\\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y_i - f_\\theta(x_i))^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right).\n\\tag{11.1}\\]\nFor the case of classification problem, we assume that \\(y_i\\) follows a Bernoulli distribution \\(y_i \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p_i)\\). The likelihood function is defined as \\[\nL(\\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{y_i} (1-p_i)^{1-y_i}.\n\\] Here \\(p_i\\) is the probability of the response variable taking on a value of 1, given the input variables. A typical approach to calculate \\(p_i\\) is to use logistic function \\(\\sigma(\\cdot)\\) \\[\\begin{align*}\nf_{\\beta}(x_i) = & \\beta^Tx_i\\\\\np_i  = & \\sigma(f_{\\beta}(x_i)) =  \\frac{e^{f_{\\beta}(x_i)}}{1+e^{f_{\\beta}(x_i)}},\n\\end{align*}\\] Notice, that logistic function \\(\\sigma(\\cdot)\\) is restricted to output values in \\((0,1)\\).\nThe optimization-based approach is to find the set of parameters \\(\\theta\\) that maximizes the likelihood function. \\[\n\\theta^* = \\arg\\max_{\\theta} L(\\theta).\n\\]\nAlthough most often, it is easier to optimize the log-likelihood function. We simply take the negative logarithm of the likelihood function \\[\nl(\\theta) = -\\log L(\\theta) =  -\\sum_{i=1}^n \\log p(y_i\\mid x_i,  \\theta).\n\\] Notice, the log-likelihood function is a sum of log-likelihoods for each data point. This is a more convenient form for optimization algorithms.\nWhy does the solution not change? Since the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, if \\(L(\\theta_1) &gt; L(\\theta_2)\\), then \\(\\log L(\\theta_1) &gt; \\log L(\\theta_2)\\). This means that the parameter value that maximizes the likelihood function will also maximize the log-likelihood function. The maximum point stays the same, just the function values are transformed.\nThe value of parameters \\(\\theta\\) that maximizes the log-likelihood is called the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE).\nNow, rather than maximizing the log-likelihood function, we minimize the negative log-likelihood function \\[\n\\theta^* = \\arg\\min_{\\theta} l(\\theta).\n\\] This problem is called the least squares problem.\nThen the negative log-likelihood function is called the loss function. Thus the problem of finding maximum likelihood estimate is equivalent to minimizing the loss function.\nLet’s calculate the loss function that corresponds to the normal likelihood function given by Equation 11.1. Using the fact that logarithm of product is a sum of logarithms, we can rewrite the likelihood function as \\[\nl(\\theta) = -\\sum_{i=1}^n \\log \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y_i - f_\\theta(x_i))^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right).\n\\] Inside the sum, we have a product of two terms. The first term is a constant with respect to \\(\\theta\\) and the second term is a function of \\(\\theta\\). We can rewrite the likelihood function as \\[\nl(\\theta) = -\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[\\log \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} + \\log \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y_i - f_\\theta(x_i))^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\right].\n\\]\nThe first term \\(\\log \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\) is a constant with respect to \\(\\theta\\), so we can drop it from the optimization problem. The second term can be simplified using the fact that \\(\\log \\exp(x) = x\\):\n\\[\nl(\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[\\frac{(y_i - f_\\theta(x_i))^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right] + C,\n\\]\nwhere \\(C\\) is a constant that does not depend on \\(\\theta\\). Since we are maximizing the log-likelihood, we can drop the constant term and the negative sign:\n\\[\nl(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f_\\theta(x_i))^2.\n\\]\nThis is the mean squared error (MSE) loss function, which is the most commonly used loss function for regression problems. The factor \\(\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\) is often absorbed into the learning rate or regularization parameter in optimization algorithms. Thus, another name of the estimator is the least squares estimator. It is the same as the maximum likelihood estimator, assuming that the \\(f_\\theta(x_i)\\) is normally distributed.\n\nPenalized Likelihood\nWhile maximum likelihood estimation provides a principled approach to parameter estimation, we can often find better estimators using what is called a penalized likelihood. In fact, there are certain cases, when penalized estimator leads to universally better estimators. In statistics, we would say that MLE is inadmissible, meaning there exists another estimator (James-Stein) that is strictly better in terms of risk. Later in Chapter 18 we will discuss the theory of penalized estimators in more detail.\nPenalized likelihood addresses overfitting by adding a regularization term to the likelihood function. Instead of maximizing just the likelihood, we maximize:\n\\[\nL_{\\text{penalized}}(\\theta) = L(\\theta) \\cdot \\exp(\\lambda \\phi(\\theta))\n\\]\nOr equivalently, we minimize the negative log-likelihood plus a penalty: \\[\nl(\\theta) =\\sum_{i=1}^n l(y_i, f_{\\theta} (x_i)) +\\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p \\phi(\\theta_j),\n\\] where \\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\) is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of regularization, and \\(\\phi(\\theta)\\) is the penalty function that measures model complexity. In machine learning the technique of adding the penalty term to the loss function is called regularization.\nRegularization can be viewed as constraint on the model space. The techniques were originally applied to solve ill-posed problems where a slight change in the initial data could significantly alter the solution. Regularization techniques were then proposed for parameter reconstruction in a physical system modeled by a linear operator implied by a set of observations. It had long been believed that ill-conditioned problems offered little practical value, until Tikhonov published his seminal paper Andrey Nikolayevich Tikhonov et al. (1943) on regularization. Andrei N. Tikhonov (1963) proposed methods for solving regularized problems of the form \\[\n\\min_\\beta  ||y- X\\beta||^2_2   + \\lambda||(\\beta - \\beta^{(0)})||^q_q.\n\\] Here \\(\\lambda\\) is the weight on the regularization penalty and the \\(\\ell_q\\)-norm is defined by \\(||\\beta||_q^q = \\sum_i \\beta_i^q\\). This optimization problem is a Lagrangian form of the constrained problem given by \\[\n\\mbox{minimize}_{\\beta}\\quad||y- X\\beta||^2_2\\qquad\\mbox{subject to }\\sum_{i=1}^{p}\\phi(\\beta_i) \\le s.\n\\] with \\(\\phi(\\beta_i) = (\\beta_i - \\beta_i^{(0)})^q\\).\nLater, sparsity became a primary driving force behind new regularization methods. The idea is that the vector of parameters \\(\\beta\\) is sparse, meaning that most of its elements are zero. This is a natural assumption for many models, such as the linear regression model. We will discuss the sparsity in more detail later in the book.\nThere are multiple optimization algorithms that can be used to find the solution to the penalized likelihood problem. Later in the book we will discuss the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm, which is a popular tool for training deep learning models.",

    "text": "11.5 Prediction Accuracy\nAfter we fit our model and find the optimal value of the parameter \\(\\theta\\), denoted by \\(\\hat \\theta\\), we need to evaluate the accuracy of the predictive model. It involves comparing the model’s predictions to actual outcomes. We can simply use the value of the loss function from the training step to evaluate model’s predictive power. However, this only tells us how well the model fits the training data. It doesn’t tell us how well the model will perform on unseen data. To evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data, we need to use a different approach.\nThe most common approach is to split the data into training and test sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance. This approach is known as the train-test split. It is a simple and effective way to evaluate how well model predicts for unseen inputs.\nAnother approach is to use cross-validation. It involves splitting the data into smaller subsets and using them to train and test the model multiple times. When our sample size is small, this allows for a more robust estimate of the model’s performance than simply splitting the data into a single training and test set. For small data sets, simple train-test split approach will be sensitive to choice of test samples, thus the estimated predicted performance will be unstable (high variance). Cross-validation helps to reduce this variance by averaging the performance across multiple folds. This makes the performance estimate more robust and less sensitive to the choice of test samples.\nCross-validation involves several steps. The data is randomly divided into \\(k\\) equal-sized chunks (folds). For each fold, the model is trained on \\(k-1\\) folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated \\(k\\) times, ensuring each fold is used for testing once. The performance of the model is evaluated on each fold using a chosen metric, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. The average of the performance metrics across all k folds is reported as the final estimate of the model’s performance.\nA common choice for \\(k\\) is 5 or 10. When \\(k=1\\), this is known as leave-one-out cross-validation. This method can be computationally expensive but is less likely to overfit the data. Stratified cross-validation ensures that each fold contains approximately the same proportion of each class as in the entire dataset. This is important for imbalanced datasets where one class is significantly larger than the others.\nNotice, that cross-validation requires re-training the model multiple times, which can be computationally expensive. Thus, for large datasets, we typically prefer simple train-test split. However, for small datasets, cross-validation can provide a more robust estimate of the model’s performance.\nEither method is limited to evaluating the model’s performance on data that is available to the modeler. What if we start using our model on data that is different from the training and test sets? Unlike in physics, when a model represents a law that is universal, in data science, we are dealing with data that is generated by a process that is not necessarily universal. For example, if we are building a model to predict the price of a house, we can train and test the model on data from a specific city. However, if we start using the model to predict the price of a house in a different city, the model might not perform as well. This is because the data from the new city might be different from the data used to train and test the model. This is known as the problem of generalization. It refers to the ability of a model to perform well on data that is different from the training and test sets.\n\nEvaluation Metrics for Regression\nThere are several metrics that can be used to evaluate the performance of regression models. We can simply use the same function as we use for fitting the model, e.g. least squares \\[\n\\text{MSE} = \\dfrac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i -\\hat y_i)^2,\n\\] here \\(\\hat y_i\\) is the predicted value of the i-th data point by the model \\(\\hat y_i = f(x_i,\\hat\\theta)\\) and \\(m\\) is the total number of data points used for the evaluation. This metric is called the Mean Squared Error (MSE). It is the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values. Lower MSE indicates better model performance, as it means the model’s predictions are closer to the actual values.\nA slight variation of this metric is Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). This is the square root of MSE and is also commonly used due to its units being the same as the target variable. \\[\n\\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\text{MSE}}.\n\\] However, MSE is sensitive to outliers, as it squares the errors, giving more weight to large errors. This can lead to misleading results when the data contains outliers.\nMean Absolute Error (MAE) solves the sensitivity to the outliers problem. It is the mean of the absolute errors, providing a more robust measure than MSE for skewed error distributions \\[\n\\text{MAE} = \\dfrac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^n |y_i -\\hat y_i|.\n\\] A variation of it is the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), which is the mean of the absolute percentage errors \\[\n\\text{MAPE} = \\dfrac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left | \\dfrac{y_i -\\hat y_i}{y_i} \\right |.\n\\]\nAlternative way to measure the predictive quality is to use the coefficient of determination, also known as the R-squared value, which measures the proportion of variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. Higher R-squared indicates better fit. However, R-squared can be misleading when comparing models with different numbers of features. R-squared is defined as follows \\[\nR^2 = 1 - \\dfrac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i -\\hat y_i)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i -\\bar y_i)^2},\n\\] where \\(\\bar y_i\\) is the mean of the target variable. R-squared is a relative measure of fit, so it can be used to compare different models. However, it is not an absolute measure of fit, so it cannot be used to determine whether a model is good or bad. It is also sensitive to the number of features in the model, so it cannot be used to compare models with different numbers of features.\nFinally, we can use graphics to evaluate the model’s performance. For example, we can create a scatterplot of the actual and predicted values of the target variable to visually compare them. We can also plot the histogram or a boxplot of the residuals (errors) to see if they are normally distributed.\n\n\nEvaluation Metrics for Classification\nAccuracy is the most fundamental metric used to evaluate models. It is defined as the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. The formula is given by \\[\\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{\\text{TP+TN}}{\\text{TP+TN+FP+FN}},\\] where TP, TN, FP, and FN are the numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, respectively. However, it can be misleading for imbalanced datasets where one class is significantly larger than others. For example, if 95% of the data belongs to one class, a model that always predicts this class will be 95% accurate, even though it’s not very useful.\nA more comprehensive understanding of model performance can be achieved by calculating the sensitivity (precision) and specificity (recall) as well as confusion matrix discussed in Section 2.4. The confusion matrix is\n\n\n\nActual/Predicted\nPositive\nNegative\n\n\n\n\nPositive\nTP\nFN\n\n\nNegative\nFP\nTN\n\n\n\nPrecision measures the proportion of positive predictions that are actually positive. It is useful for evaluating how good the model is at identifying true positives. Recall measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model. It is useful for evaluating how good the model is at not missing true positives.\nThen we can use those to calculate F1 Score which is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced view of both metrics. The formula is given by \\[\n\\text{F1 Score} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\text{Precision} \\cdot \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}}.\n\\] Higher F1 score indicates better overall performance. If misclassifying certain instances is more costly than others, weighted metrics account for these different costs. For imbalanced datasets, metrics like F1 score or balanced accuracy are important to avoid misleading interpretations.\nSometimes, we use multiple metrics to get a comprehensive assessment of the model’s performance. Additionally, consider comparing the model’s performance to a baseline model or other existing models for the same task. Sometimes, it is hard to beat a “coin flip” classification model, when the model predicts the class randomly with equal probability. In regression, a simple baseline model is \\(f(x_i) = \\bar y\\), which is the mean of the target variable.\n\n\n\n\nBonfiglio, Rita, Annarita Granaglia, Raffaella Giocondo, Manuel Scimeca, and Elena Bonanno. 2021. “Molecular Aspects and Prognostic Significance of Microcalcifications in Human Pathology: A Narrative Review.” International Journal of Molecular Sciences 22 (120).\n\n\nFeynman, Richard. n.d. “Feynman :: Rules of Chess.”\n\n\nHalevy, Alon, Peter Norvig, and Fernando Pereira. 2009. “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data.” IEEE Intelligent Systems 24 (2): 8–12.\n\n\nNicosia, Luca, Giulia Gnocchi, Ilaria Gorini, Massimo Venturini, Federico Fontana, Filippo Pesapane, Ida Abiuso, et al. 2023. “History of Mammography: Analysis of Breast Imaging Diagnostic Achievements over the Last Century.” Healthcare 11 (1596).\n\n\nTikhonov, Andrei N. 1963. “Solution of Incorrectly Formulated Problems and the Regularization Method.” Sov Dok 4: 1035–38.\n\n\nTikhonov, Andrey Nikolayevich et al. 1943. “On the Stability of Inverse Problems.” In Dokl.

    "text": "12.1 Statistical Properties of Linear Models\nThe simplest form of a parametric model is a linear model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the output variable. There are several ways to specify such a family of functions, for example as linear combinations of inputs \\[\nf_{\\beta}(x)=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1 + \\ldots + \\beta_p x_p.\n\\] Technically, this is not a linear function. In mathematics, it is called an affine function, which is a linear function with an additional constant term (\\(\\beta_0\\)). However, if we add a dummy variable \\(x_0 = 1\\) to the input vector \\(x\\), we can rewrite the function as a linear function of the parameters \\(\\beta = (\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\ldots,\\beta_p)\\) using vector notation \\[\nf_{\\beta}(x) = \\beta^Tx, ~ x = (1,x_1,\\ldots,x_p).\n\\]\nNote that instead of using a generic notation \\(\\theta\\) for the parameters, we use \\(\\beta\\) to emphasize that we are talking about the parameters of the linear model. The vector \\(\\beta\\) is called the regression coefficients.\nRegression analysis is the most widely used statistical tool for understanding relationships among variables. It provides a conceptually simple method for investigating functional relationships between one or more factors and an outcome of interest. This relationship is expressed in the form of an equation, which we call the model, connecting the response or dependent variable and one or more explanatory or predictor variables.\nA more general form of a linear model is a linear combination of basis functions \\[\nf_{\\beta}(x)= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\psi_1(x) + \\ldots + \\beta_M \\psi_M(x) = \\beta^T \\psi(x),\n\\] where \\(\\psi_1,\\ldots,  \\psi_M\\) are the basis functions and \\(\\psi(x) = (1, \\psi_1(x),\\ldots,\\psi_M(x))\\).\nNotice in the latter case, the function \\(f\\) is linear in the parameters \\(\\beta = (\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\ldots, \\beta_p)\\) but not in the input variables \\(x\\). The goal of the modeler is to choose an appropriate set of predictors and basis functions that will lead to a good reconstruction of the input-output relations. After we’ve specified what the function \\(f\\) is, we need to find the best possible values of parameters \\(\\beta\\).\nFinding a predictive rule \\(f_{\\beta}(x)\\) starts by defining the criterion of what is a good prediction. We assume that the function \\(f_{\\beta}(x)\\) is parameterized by a vector of parameters \\(\\beta\\) and we want to find the best value of \\(\\beta\\) that will give us the best prediction.\nWe will use a loss function that quantifies the difference between the predicted and actual values of the output variable. It is closely related to the loss function used in decision theory (thus the name). In decision theory, a loss function is a mathematical representation of the “cost” associated with making a particular decision in a given state of the world. It quantifies the negative consequences of choosing a specific action and helps guide decision-makers towards optimal choices. You can think of the loss function in predictive problems as a “cost” associated with making an inaccurate prediction given the values of the input variables \\(x\\).\nThe least squares loss function, discussed in Chapter 11, is the sum of squared differences between the predicted and actual values. Given observed data set \\(\\{(x_1,y_1),\\ldots,(x_n,y_n)\\}\\), the least squares estimator is the value of \\(\\beta\\) that minimizes the sum of squared errors \\[\n\\min_{\\beta}\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat y_i)^2, ~ \\hat y_i =  \\hat \\beta^T \\psi(x).\n\\]\nIn the unconditional case, when we do not observe any inputs \\(x\\), the least squares estimator is the sample mean. We can solve this minimization problem by taking the derivative of the loss function and setting it to zero \\[\n\\frac{d}{d\\beta}\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\beta_0)^2 = -2\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\beta_0) = 0\n\\] which gives us the solution \\[\n\\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\n\\] which is the sample average.\nWe used lm function to fit the linear model for the housing data. This function uses least squares loss function to estimate the parameters of the line. One of the nice properties of the least squares estimator is that it has a closed-form solution. This means that we can find the values of the parameters that minimize the loss function by solving a system of linear equations rather than using an optimization algorithm. The linear system is obtained by taking the gradient (multivariate derivative) of the loss function with respect to the parameters and setting it to zero. The loss function \\[\n\\mathcal{L}(\\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f_{\\beta}(x_i))^2\n\\] is a quadratic function of the parameters, so the solution is unique and can be found analytically. The gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters is \\[\n\\nabla \\mathcal{L}(\\beta) = -2\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f_{\\beta}(x_i))\\nabla f_{\\beta}(x_i).\n\\] Given that \\(f_{\\beta}(x_i) = \\beta^T \\psi(x_i)\\), the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters is \\[\n\\nabla \\mathcal{L}(\\beta)  = -2\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\beta^T \\psi(x_i))\\psi(x_i)^T.\n\\] Setting the gradient to zero gives us the normal equations \\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\psi(x_i)^T = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\beta^T \\psi(x_i) \\psi(x_i)^T.\n\\] In matrix form, the normal equations are \\[\n\\Psi^Ty = \\Psi^T\\Psi\\beta\n\\tag{12.1}\\] where \\(\\Psi\\) is the design matrix with rows \\(\\psi(x_i)^T\\) and \\(y\\) is the vector of output values. The solution to the normal equations is \\[\n\\hat{\\beta} = (\\Psi^T\\Psi)^{-1}\\Psi^Ty.\n\\]\nThe function solve solves the Equation 12.1, and indeed finds the same values as the lm function. Essentially this is what the lm function does under the hood. The solve function uses the elimination method to solve the system of linear equations. The method we all learned when we were introduced to linear equations. The technique is known in linear algebra as LU decomposition.\nIn our housing example we used a linear model to predict the price of a house based on its square footage. The model is simple and easy to interpret, making it suitable for both prediction and interpretation. The model provides insights into the relationship between house size and price, allowing us to understand how changes in house size affect the price. The model can also be used to make accurate predictions of house prices based on square footage. This demonstrates the versatility of linear models for both prediction and interpretation tasks.\nLet’s consider another example of using a linear model that allows us to understand the relationship between the performance of stock portfolio managed by John Maynard Keynes and overall market performance.\nPreviously we demonstrated how the Central Limit Theorem enables us to derive key statistical properties of the sample mean, including its asymptotic normality, unbiasedness, and the relationship between sample size and estimation precision. These same principles extend naturally to linear models, where we can derive analogous properties for the least squares estimators of regression coefficients.\nFirst, we introduce a regression model using the language of probability. A regression model assumes that the mean of the output variable \\(y\\) depends linearly on predictors \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_p\\) \\[\ny = \\beta_0 +  \\beta_1 x + \\ldots + \\beta_p x_p + \\epsilon,~ \\text{where}~\\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2).\n\\] Often, we use simpler dot-product notation \\[\ny = \\beta^Tx + \\epsilon,\n\\] where \\(\\beta = (\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\ldots,\\beta_p)\\) is the vector of regression coefficients and \\(x = (1,x_1,\\ldots,x_p)\\) is the vector of predictors, with 1 appended to the beginning.\nA more convenient form of the model is as follows \\[\ny \\mid x \\overset{iid}{\\sim}  N(\\beta^Tx, \\sigma^2).\n\\]\nThe additional term \\(\\epsilon\\) is a random variable that captures the uncertainty in the relationship between \\(y\\) and \\(x\\); it is called the error term or the residual. The error term is assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). Thus, the linear regression model has a new parameter \\(\\sigma^2\\) that models dispersion of \\(y_i\\) around the mean \\(\\beta^Tx\\), let’s see an example.",

    "text": "Estimates and Intervals\nIn our housing example, we estimated the parameter \\(\\beta_1\\) to be equal to 113.12 and made a conclusion that the price of the house goes up by that amount when the living area goes up by one unit. However, the estimated value is based on a sample. The sample is a result of well-designed data collection procedure and is representative of the population, and we should expect the estimated value to be close to the true value. However, the estimated value is not the true value of the parameter, but an estimate of it. The true value of the parameter is unknown and the estimated value is subject to sampling error.\nThe sampling error is modeled by the normal distribution. The standard error of the estimate is a measure of the uncertainty in the estimated value of the parameter. The standard error is calculated from the sample data and is used to calculate confidence intervals and p-values for the estimated parameter.\nWe used the lm function to estimate the parameters of the linear model. The estimated values of the parameters are given in the Estimate column of the output. The estimated value of the intercept is \\(\\hat \\beta_0 = 13.439394\\) and the estimated value of the slope is \\(\\hat \\beta_1 = 113.1225418\\). These values are calculated using the least squares loss function, which minimizes the sum of squared differences between the predicted and actual values of the output variable. The estimated values of the parameters are subject to sampling error, which is modeled by the normal distribution. The standard error of the estimates is given in the Std. Error column of the output. The standard error is a measure of the uncertainty in the estimated values of the parameters. The t-statistic is the ratio of the estimated coefficient to its standard error. The p-value is the probability of observing a value at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. In this case, the p-value for the livingArea coefficient is less than 0.05, so we conclude that the coefficient is statistically significant. This means that the size of the house is a statistically significant predictor of the price. The Residual standard error is the standard deviation of the residuals \\(\\hat y_i - y_i,~i=1,\\ldots,n\\).\n\nExample 12.3 (House Prices) Let’s go back to the Saratoga Houses dataset\n\nd = read.csv(\"../data/SaratogaHouses.csv\")\nd$price = d$price/1000; d$livingArea = d$livingArea/1000\nl = lm(price ~ livingArea, data=d)\nl %&gt;% tidy() %&gt;% kable()\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n13\n5.0\n2.7\n0.01\n\n\nlivingArea\n113\n2.7\n42.2\n0.00\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output of the lm function has several components. Besides calculating the estimated values of the coefficients, given in the Estimate column, the method also calculates standard error (Std. Error) and t-statistic (t value) for each coefficient. The t-statistic is the ratio of the estimated coefficient to its standard error. The p-value (Pr(&gt;|t|)) is the probability of observing a value at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. The null hypothesis is that the coefficient is equal to zero. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we typically reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the coefficient is statistically significant. In this case, the p-value for the livingArea coefficient is less than 0.05, so we conclude that the coefficient is statistically significant. This means that the size of the house is a statistically significant predictor of the price. The Residual standard error is the standard deviation of the residuals \\(\\hat y_i - y_i,~i=1,\\ldots,n\\).\n\nThe estimated values of the parameters were calculated using least squares loss function discussed above. The residual standard error is also relatively easy to calculate from the model residuals \\[\ns_e = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{n-2} \\sum_{i=1}^n ( \\hat y_i - y_i )^2 }.\n\\] Now the question is, how was the p-value for the estimates calculated? And why did we assume that \\(\\epsilon\\) is normally distributed in the first place? The normality of \\(\\epsilon\\) and as a consequence, the conditional normality of \\(y \\mid x \\overset{iid}{\\sim}  N(\\beta^Tx, \\sigma^2)\\) is easy to explain; it is simply due to mathematical convenience. Plus, this assumption happens to describe the reality well in a wide range of applications. One of those conveniences is our ability to calculate the mean and variance of the distribution of \\(\\hat \\beta_0\\) and \\(\\hat \\beta_1\\).\nTo understand how to calculate the p-values, we first notice that there is uncertainty about the values of the parameters \\(\\beta_i\\)s. To get a feeling for the amount of variability in our experiments, imagine that we have two sample data sets. For example, we have housing data from two different realtor firms. Do you think that the estimated value of price per square foot will be the same for both of those? The answer is no. Let’s demonstrate with an example; we simulate 20 data sets from the same distribution and estimate 20 different linear models.\n\nset.seed(92) #Kuzy\nd = read.csv(\"../data/SaratogaHouses.csv\")\nd$price = d$price/1000; d$livingArea = d$livingArea/1000\nplot(d$livingArea, d$price, pch=20, col=\"blue\", xlab=\"Living Area\", ylab=\"Price\")\nfor (i in 1:10) {\n  # Sample with replacement\n  dnew = d[sample(1:nrow(d),replace=T),]\n  # Fit a linear model\n  l = lm(price ~ livingArea, data=dnew, subset = sample(1:nrow(d),100))\n  abline(l, col=\"green\", lwd=3)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1: Twenty different linear models estimated using randomly selected subsample of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1 shows the results of this simulation. We can see that the estimated coefficients \\(\\hat \\beta_i\\) are different for each of the 20 samples. This is due to the sampling error. The sampling error is the difference between the estimated value of a parameter and its true value. The value of \\(\\beta_1\\) will differ from sample to sample. In other words, it will be a random variable. The sampling distribution of \\(\\beta_1\\) describes how it varies over different samples with the \\(x\\) values fixed. Statistical view of linear regression allows us to calculate confidence and prediction intervals for estimated parameters. It turns out that when least squares principle is used, the estimated \\(\\hat\\beta_1\\) is normally distributed: \\(\\hat\\beta_1\\mid \\beta_1 \\sim N( \\beta_1 , s_1^2 )\\). Let’s see how we can derive this result.\nThe extension of the central limit theorem, sometimes called the Lindeberg CLT, states that a linear combination of independent random variables that satisfy some mild condition are approximately normally distributed. We can show that estimates of \\((\\beta_0\\ldots,\\beta_p)\\) are linear combinations of the observed values of \\(y\\) and are therefore normally distributed. Indeed, if we write the linear regression model in matrix form \\[\nY = X \\beta + \\epsilon,\n\\] where \\(Y\\) is the vector of observed values of the dependent variable, \\(X\\) is the matrix of observed values of the independent variables, \\(\\beta\\) is the vector of unknown parameters, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is the vector of errors. Then, if we take the derivative of the loss function for linear regression and set it to zero, we get the following expression for the estimated parameters \\[\n\\hat \\beta =  AY,\n\\] where \\(A = (X^TX)^{-1}X^T\\). Due to Lindeberg central limit theorem, \\(\\hat \\beta\\) is normally distributed. This is a useful property that allows us to calculate confidence intervals and p-values for the estimated parameters.\nNow, we need to compute the mean and variance of \\(\\hat \\beta\\). The mean is easy to compute, since the expectation of the sum is the sum of expectations, we have \\(\\hat{\\beta} = A(X\\beta + \\epsilon)\\), hence \\[\n\\hat{\\beta} = \\beta + A\\epsilon\n\\]\nThe expectation and variance of \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) are then: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\E{\\hat{\\beta}} = & \\E{\\beta + A\\epsilon} = \\E{\\beta} + \\E{A\\epsilon} = \\beta\\\\\n\\Var{\\hat{\\beta}} = & \\Var{A\\epsilon} = A\\Var{\\epsilon}A^T = \\sigma^2 A(X^TX)^{-1}A^T = \\sigma^2 (X^TX)^{-1}\n\\end{align*}\\] Putting together the expectation and variance, we get the following distribution for \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\): \\[\n\\hat{\\beta} \\sim N(\\beta, \\sigma^2 (X^TX)^{-1}).\n\\]\nWe can think of the estimated coefficients \\(\\hat \\beta_i\\) as an average amount of change in \\(y\\), when \\(x_i\\) goes up by one unit. Since this average was calculated using a sample data, it is subject to sampling error and the sampling error is modeled by the normal distribution. Assuming that residuals \\(\\epsilon\\) are independently normally distributed with a variance that does not depend on \\(x\\) (homoscedasticity), we can calculate the mean and variance of the distribution of \\(\\hat \\beta_i\\). This is a useful property that allows us to calculate confidence intervals and p-values for the estimated parameters.\nIn summary, the statistical view of the linear regression model is useful for understanding the uncertainty associated with the estimated parameters. It also allows us to calculate confidence intervals and prediction intervals for the output variable.\n\nAverage value of output \\(y\\) is a linear function of input \\(x\\) and lie on the straight line of regression \\(\\hat y_i = \\beta^Tx_i\\).\nThe values of \\(y\\) are statistically independent.\nThe true value of \\(y = \\hat y_i + \\epsilon_i\\) is a random variable, and it is normally distributed around the mean with variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). This variance is the same for all values of \\(y\\).\nThe estimated values of the parameters \\(\\hat \\beta_i\\) are calculated from observed data and are subject to the sampling error and we are not certain about them. This uncertainty is modeled by the normally distributed around the true values \\(\\beta\\). Given that errors \\(\\epsilon_i\\) are homoscedastic and independent, we have \\(Var(\\hat{\\beta}) = \\sigma^2 (X^TX)^{-1}\\).\n\nAgain, consider a house example. Say in our data we have 10 houses with the same squire footage, say 2000. Now the third point states, that the prices of those houses should follow a normal distribution and if we are to compare prices of 2000 sqft houses and 2500 sqft houses, they will have the same standard deviation. The second point means that price of one house does not depend on the price of another house.\nAll of the assumptions in the regression model can be written using probabilist notations: \\[\ny \\mid x \\overset{iid}{\\sim}  N(\\beta^Tx, \\sigma^2).\n\\]\nIn the case when we have only one predictor the variance of the estimated slope \\(\\hat \\beta_1\\) is given by \\[\n\\Var{\\hat \\beta_1} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n ( x_i - \\bar{x} )^2 } = \\frac{ \\sigma^2 }{ (n-1) s_x^2 },\n\\] where \\(s_x^2\\) is the sample variance of \\(x\\). Thus, there are three factors that impact the size of standard error for \\(\\beta_1\\): sample size (\\(n\\)), error variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)), and \\(x\\)-spread, \\(s_x\\).\nWe can empirically demonstrate the sampling error by simulating several samples from the same distribution and estimating several linear models. We can see that the estimated coefficients \\(\\hat \\beta_i\\) are normally distributed around the true values \\(\\beta_i\\). If we plot coefficients for 1000 different models, we can see that the empirical distribution resembles a normal distribution.\n\nset.seed(92) #Kuzy\n# Read housing data\nd = read.csv(\"../data/SaratogaHouses.csv\")\nd$price = d$price/1000; d$livingArea = d$livingArea/1000\n# Simulate 1000 samples\nn = 1000\n# Create a matrix to store the results\nbeta = matrix(0, nrow=n, ncol=2)\n# Simulate 1000 samples\nfor (i in 1:n) {\n  # Sample with replacement\n  dnew = d[sample(1:nrow(d),replace=T),]\n  # Fit a linear model\n  l = lm(price ~ livingArea, data=dnew)\n  # Store the coefficients\n  beta[i,] = coef(l)\n}\nind = 2\n# Plot the results\nplot(beta[,1], beta[,2], col=\"blue\", xlab=\"Intercept\", ylab=\"Slope\", bg=\"lightblue\", cex=0.8)\nabline(h=coef(l)[2], lwd=3, col=\"red\")\nabline(v=coef(l)[1], lwd=3, col=\"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX = cbind(1, d$livingArea)\n# Calculate the variance of the coefficients\nvar = sigma(l)^2 * solve(t(X) %*% X)\nvarb = var[ind,ind]/0.63\nhist(beta[,ind], col=\"blue\", xlab=\"Intercept\", main=\"\",freq=F)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbt = seq(80,140,0.1)\n\nAccounting for uncertainty in \\(\\hat \\beta\\)s we can calculate confidence intervals for the predicted average \\(\\hat y\\). When we additionally account for the uncertainty in the predicted value \\(\\hat y\\), we can calculate prediction intervals.\nAnother advantage of adopting a statistical view of the linear regression model is ability to quantify information about potential outliers. Outliers are points that are extreme relative to our model predictions. Recall, that residual is \\(e_i  = y_i- \\hat y_i\\). Since our predicted value \\(\\hat y_i\\) follows a normal distribution, the residual also follows a normal distribution, since it is a difference of normal random variable \\(\\hat y_i\\) and a constant \\(y_i\\). It easy to see that \\[e_i \\sim N(0, s_e^2),\\] where \\(s_e^2\\) is an empirical estimate of the error’s variance.\nConsider the relation between the fitted values \\(\\hat y_i\\) and residuals \\(e_i\\). Our predictions are given by the line. The residual \\(e_i\\) and predicted value \\(\\hat y_i\\) for the \\(i\\)th observation are related via \\[\ny_i = \\hat{y}_i + ( y_i - \\hat{y}_i ) = \\hat{y}_i + e_i.\n\\]\nResiduals allow us to define outliers. They simply have large residuals. We re-scale the residuals by their standard errors. This lets us define \\[r_i = \\frac{ e_i }{ s_{ e} } =\\frac{y_i - \\hat{y}_i   }{ s_{ e } }\\] Since residuals follow normal distribution \\(e \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\), in 95% of the time we expect the standardized residuals to satisfy \\(- 2 &lt; r_i &lt; 2\\). Any observation with \\(|r_i| &gt; 3\\) is an extreme outlier; it is three sigmas away from the mean.\nAnother type of observations we are interested in are the influential points. These are observations that affect the magnitude of our estimates \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\)s. They are important to find as they typically have economic consequences. We will use Cook’s distance to assess the significance of an influential point. Cook’s distance associated with sample \\(i\\) measures the change in estimated model parameters \\(\\hat \\beta\\) when sample \\(i\\) is removed from the training data set.\nIntuitively, we model regression-back-to-the-mean effect. This is one of the most interesting statistical effects you’ll see in daily life. In statistics, regression does not mean “going backwards”, but rather the tendency for a variable that is extremely high or low to move closer to the average upon subsequent measurement. For example, Francis Galton, who was a cousin of Charles Darwin, in his study on regression to the mean height showed that if your parents are taller than the average, you’ll regress back to the average. While people might expect the children of tall parents to be even taller and the children of short parents to be even shorter, Galton found that this wasn’t the case. Instead, he observed that the heights of the children tended to be closer to the average height for the population. Galton termed this phenomenon “regression towards mediocrity” (now more commonly known as “regression to the mean”). It meant that extreme characteristics (in this case, height) in parents were likely to be less extreme (closer to the average) in their children. It is a classic example that helped introduce and explain this statistical concept. Galton’s finding was one of the first insights into what is now a well-known statistical phenomenon. It doesn’t imply that all individual cases will follow this pattern; rather, it’s a trend observed across a population. It’s important to understand that regression to the mean doesn’t suggest that extreme traits diminish over generations but rather that an extreme measurement is partly due to random variation and is likely to be less extreme upon subsequent measurement.\nAnother example was documented by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in their book Thinking, Fast and Slow. They found that when a person performs a task, their performance is partly due to skill and partly due to luck. They observed that when a person performs a task and achieves an extreme result, their subsequent performance is likely to be less extreme. Particularly they studied effect of criticism and praise used by Israeli Air Force fighter pilots trainers. After criticism, the low-scoring pilots were retested. Often, their scores improve. At first glance, this seems like a clear effect of feedback from the trainer. However, some of this improvement is likely a statistical artifact and demonstrates the regression to the mean effect.\nWhy? Those pilots who initially scored poorly were, statistically speaking, somewhat unlucky. Their low scores may have been due to a bad day, stress, or other factors. When retested, their scores are likely to be closer to their true skill level, which is closer to the average. This natural movement towards the average can give the illusion that the intervention (praise or criticism) was more effective than it actually was. Conversely, if the top performers were praised and retested, we might find their scores decrease slightly, not necessarily due to the inefficacy of the praise but due to their initial high scores being partly due to good luck or an exceptionally good day. In conclusion, in pilot training and other fields, it’s important to consider regression to the mean when evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. Without this consideration, one might draw incorrect conclusions about the impact of training or other changes.\n\nExample 12.4 (Google vs S&P 500) We will demonstrate how we can use statistical properties of a linear regression model to understand the relationship between returns of a google stock and the S&P 500 index. We will use Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) regression model to estimate the expected return of an investment into Google stock and to price the risk. The CAPM model is\n\\[\n\\mathrm{GOOG} = \\alpha + \\beta \\mathrm{SP500} + \\epsilon\n\\] On the left hand side, we have the return that investors expect to earn from investing into Google stock. In the CAPM model, this return is typically modeled as a dependent variable.\nThe input variable SP500 represents the average return of the entire US market. Beta measures the volatility or systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. A beta greater than 1 indicates that the security is more volatile than the market, while a beta less than 1 indicates it is less volatile. Alpha is the intercept of the regression line, it measures the excess return of the security over the market. The error term \\(\\epsilon\\) captures the uncertainty in the relationship between the returns of Google stock and the market.\nIn a CAPM regression analysis, the goal is to find out how well the model explains the returns of a security based on its beta. This involves regressing the security’s excess returns (returns over the risk-free rate) against the excess returns of the market. The slope of the regression line represents the beta, and the intercept should ideally be close to the risk-free rate, although in practice it often deviates. This model helps in understanding the relationship between the expected return and the systematic risk of an investment.\nBased on the uncertainty associated with the estimates for alpha and beta, we can formulate several hypothesis tests, for example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis\nQuestion\n\n\n\n\n\\(H_0: \\beta = 0\\)\nIs Google related to the market?\n\n\n\\(H_0: \\alpha = 0\\)\nDoes Google outperform the market in a consistent fashion?\n\n\n\n\ngetSymbols(Symbols = c(\"GOOG\",\"SPY\"),from='2017-01-03',to='2023-12-29')\n\n \"GOOG\" \"SPY\" \n\ngret = as.numeric(dailyReturn(GOOG))\nspyret = as.numeric(dailyReturn(SPY))\nl = lm(gret ~ spyret)\ntidy(l) %&gt;% knitr::kable(digits=4)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.0003\n0.0003\n1.1\n0.27\n\n\nspyret\n1.1706\n0.0240\n48.8\n0.00\n\n\n\nGoogle vs S&P 500 returns between 2017-2023\n\n\n\nplot(gret, spyret, bg=\"lightblue\", xlab=\"Google Return\", ylab=\"SPY Return\")\nabline(l, lwd=3, col=\"red\")\n\n\n\n\nGoogle vs S&P 500 returns between 2017-2023\n\n\n\n\nHere’s what we get after we fit the model using function\nOur best estimates are \\[\n\\hat \\alpha = 0.0004 \\; , \\; \\hat{\\beta} = 1.01\n\\]\nNow we can provide the results for the hypotheses we set at the beginning. Given that the p-value for \\(H_0: \\beta = 0\\) is &lt;2e-16 we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that Google is related to the market. The p-value for \\(H_0: \\alpha = 0\\) is 0.06, which is greater than 0.05, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis and conclude that Google does not outperform the market in a consistent fashion in the 2017-2023 period.\nFurther, we can answer some of the other important questions, such as how much will Google move if the market goes up \\(10\\)%?\n\nalpha = coef(l)[1]\nbeta = coef(l)[2]\n# Calculate the expected return\nalpha + beta*0.1\n\n(Intercept) \n       0.12 \n\n\nHowever, if we look at the earlier period between 2005-2016 (the earlier days of Google) the results will be different.\n\ngetSymbols(Symbols = c(\"GOOG\",\"SPY\"),from='2005-01-03',to='2016-12-29');\n\n \"GOOG\" \"SPY\" \n\ngret = as.numeric(dailyReturn(GOOG))\nspyret = as.numeric(dailyReturn(SPY))\nl = lm(gret ~ spyret)\ntidy(l) %&gt;% knitr::kable(digits=4)\n\n\n\nTable 12.1: Google vs S&P 500 returns between 2005-2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.0006\n0.0003\n2.2\n0.03\n\n\nspyret\n0.9231\n0.0230\n40.1\n0.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(spyret, gret, col=\"blue\", ylab=\"Google Return\", xlab=\"SPY Return\", bg = \"lightblue\", cex=0.8)\nabline(l, lwd=3, col=\"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.2: Google vs S&P 500 returns between 2005-2016\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this period Google did consistently outperform the market. The p-value for \\(H_0: \\alpha = 0\\) is 0.03.\n\n\nExample 12.5 (CAPM Model for Yahoo! Stock) Rather than estimate \\(\\mu\\) directly, the CAPM estimates the difference between \\(\\mu\\) and the risk-free rate \\(r_f\\). This quantity \\(\\mu-r_f\\) is known as the expected excess return (excess relative to a risk-free investment). The CAPM relates the expected excess return of a stock to that of an underlying benchmark, typically a broad-based market index. Let \\(\\mu_M\\) and \\(\\sigma_M\\) denote the return and volatility on the market index. The implication of CAPM is that there is a linear relationship between the expected excess return of a stock, \\(\\mu-r_f\\), and the excess return of the market, \\(\\mu_M-r_f\\).\n\\[\n\\text{Excess \\; Return}_{\\text{Stock}} =  \\beta \\;  \\text{Excess \\;\nReturn}_{\\text{Market}}\n\\] \\[\n\\mu-r_f = \\beta(\\mu_M - r_f )\n\\] Put simply, the expected excess return of a stock is \\(\\beta\\) times the excess expected return of the market. Beta (\\(\\beta\\)) is a measure of a stock’s risk in relation to the market. A beta of 1.3 implies that the excess return on the stock is expected to move up or down 30% more than the market. A beta bigger than one implies the stock is riskier than the market and goes up (and down) faster than the market goes up (and down). A beta less than one implies the stock is less risky than the market.\nUsing the CAPM, the expected return of the stock can now be defined as the risk free interest rate plus beta times the expected excess return of the market, \\[\n\\mu = \\text{Expected \\; Return}_{\\text{Stock}} = r_f+\\beta (\\mu_M-r_f)\n\\] Beta is typically estimated from a regression of the individual stock’s returns on those of the market. The other parameters are typically measured as the historical average return on the market \\(\\mu_M\\) and the yield on Treasury Bills \\(r_f\\). Together these form an estimate of \\(\\mu\\). The volatility parameter \\(\\sigma\\) is estimated by the standard deviation of historical returns.\nOur qualitative discussion implicitly took the year as the unit of time. For our example, we make one minor change and consider daily returns so that \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are interpreted as a daily rate of return and daily volatility (or standard deviation). We use an annual risk-free rate of 5%; this makes a daily risk-free rate of .019%, \\(r_f = 0.00019\\), assuming there are 252 trading days in a year. A simple historical average is used to estimate the market return (\\(\\mu_M\\)) for the Nasdaq 100. The average annual return is about 23%, with corresponding daily mean \\(\\mu_M = 0.00083\\). A regression using daily returns from 1996-2000 leads to an estimate of \\(\\beta = 1.38\\). Combining these (pieces) leads to an estimated expected return of Yahoo!, \\(\\mu_{Yahoo} = 0.00019+1.38(0.00083-0.00019) = 0.00107\\) on a daily basis. Note that the CAPM model estimates a future return that is much lower than the observed rate over the last three-plus years of .42% per day or 289% per year.\nTo measure the riskiness of Yahoo! notice that the daily historical volatility is 5%, i.e. \\(\\sigma = 0.05\\). On an annual basis this implies a volatility of \\(\\sigma \\sqrt{T} = 0.05 \\sqrt{252} = 0.79\\), that is 79%. For comparison, the benchmark Nasdaq 100 has historical daily volatility 1.9% and an annual historical volatility of 30%. The estimates of all the parameters are recorded in Table 12.2.\n\n\n\nTable 12.2: Key Parameter Estimates Based on Daily Returns 1996–2000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsset\nExpected return\nVolatility\nRegression coefft (s.e.)\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!\n\\(\\mu = 0.00107\\)\n\\(\\sigma = 0.050\\)\n\\(\\beta = 1.38 (.07)\\)\n\n\nNasdaq 100\n\\(\\mu_M = 0.00083\\)\n\\(\\sigma_M = 0.019\\)\n1\n\n\nTreasury Bills\n\\(r_f = 0.00019\\)\n–\n–",

    "section": "12.2 Factor Regression and Feature Engineering",
    "text": "12.2 Factor Regression and Feature Engineering\nA linear model assumes that output variable is proportional to the input variable plus an offset. However, this is not always the case. Often, we need to transform input variables by combining multiple inputs into a single predictor, for example by taking a ratio or putting inputs on a different scale, e.g. log-scale. In machine learning, this process is called feature engineering.\nOne of the classic examples of feature engineering is Fama-French three-factor model which is used in asset pricing and portfolio management. The model states that asset returns depend on (1) market risk, (2) the outperforming of small versus big companies, and (3) the outperformance of high book/market versus small book/market companies, mathematically \\[r = R_f + \\beta(R_m - R_f) + b_s\\cdot SMB + b_v\\cdot HML + \\alpha\\] Here \\(R_f\\) is risk-free return, \\(R_m\\) is the return of market, \\(SMB\\) stands for \"Small market capitalization Minus Big\" and \\(HML\\) for \"High book-to-market ratio Minus Low\"; they measure the historic excess returns of small caps over big caps and of value stocks over growth stocks. These factors are calculated with combinations of portfolios composed by ranked stocks (BtM ranking, Cap ranking) and available historical market data.\n\nLogarithmic and Power Transformations\nConsider, the growth of the Apple stock between 2000 and 2024. With the exception of the 2008 financial crisis period and 2020 COVID 19 related declines, the stock price has been growing exponentially. Figure 12.3 shows the price of the Apple stock between 2000 and 2024. The price is closely related to the company’s growth.\n\ngetSymbols(Symbols = \"AAPL\",from='2000-01-01',to='2023-12-31');\n\n \"AAPL\"\n\nplot(AAPL$AAPL.Adjusted, type='l', col=\"blue\", xlab=\"Date\", ylab=\"Price\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.3: Apple stock price growth in the 2000-2024 period\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2008 and 2020 declines are more related to extraneous factors, rather than the growth of the company. Thus, we can conclude that the overall growth of the company is exponential. The growth of a successful company typically follows the rule of compounding. Compounding is a fundamental principle that describes how some quantity grows over time when this quantity increases by a fixed percentage periodically. This is a very common phenomenon in nature and business. For example, if two parents have 2.2 children on average, then the population increases by 10% every generation. Another example is growth of investment in a savings account.\nA more intuitive example is probably an investment in a savings account. If you invest \\(1000\\) in a savings account with \\(10\\%\\) annual interest rate and you get paid once a year, then your account value will be \\(1100\\) by the end of the year. However, if you get paid \\(n\\) times a year, and initially invest \\(y_0\\), the final value \\(y\\) of the account after \\(t\\) years will be \\[\ny = y_0 \\times (1 + r/n)^{nt}\n\\] where \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate. When you get paid every month (\\(n=12\\)), a traditional payout schedule used by banks, then \\[\ny = 1000 \\times (1 + 0.1/12)^{12} = 1105.\n\\] A value slightly higher than the annual payout of 1100.\nThe effect of compounding is minimal in the short term. However, the effect of compounding is more pronounced when the growth rate is higher and time periods are longer. For example at \\(r=2\\), \\(n=365\\) and 4-year period \\(t=4\\), you get \\[\ny = 1000 \\times (1 + 2/365)^{3\\times 365} = 2,916,565.\n\\] Your account is close to 3 million dollars! Compared to \\(n=1\\) scenario \\[\ny = 1000 \\times (1 + 2)^{4} = 81,000,\n\\] when you will end up with merely 81 thousand. This is why compounding is often referred to as the “eighth wonder of the world” in investing contexts, emphasizing its power in growing wealth over time.\nIn general, as \\(n\\) goes up, the growth rate of the quantity approaches the constant\n\nT = 1:100\nr = 1\nplot(T, (1+r/T)^T, type='l', col=\"blue\", ylab=\"Future Value\")\nabline(h=exp(r), col=\"red\", lwd=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.4: Growth of an investment in a savings account when n increases and return rate is 100% per year\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.4 shows the growth of an investment in a savings account when \\(n\\) increases and return rate is \\(100\\%\\) per year. We can see that the growth rate approaches the constant \\(e \\approx 2.72\\) as \\(n\\) increases. \\[\n(1+r/n)^n \\rightarrow e^r,~\\text{as}~n \\rightarrow \\infty.\n\\] This limit was first delivered by Leonhard Euler and the number \\(e\\) is known as Euler’s number.\nComing back to the growth of the Apple company, we can think of it growing at a small constant rate every day. The relation between the time and size of Apple is multiplicative. Meaning when time increases by one day, the size of the company increases by a small constant percentage. This is a multiplicative relation. In contrast, linear relation is additive, meaning that when time increases by one day, the size of the company increases by a constant amount. The exponential growth model is given by the formula \\[\ny = y_0 \\times e^{\\beta^Tx}.\n\\] There are many business and natural science examples where multiplicative relation holds. IF we apply the \\(\\log\\) function to both sides of the equation, we get \\[\n\\log y = \\log y_0 + \\beta^Tx.\n\\] This is a linear relation between \\(\\log y\\) and \\(x\\). Thus, we can use linear regression to estimate the parameters of the exponential growth model by putting the output variable \\(y\\) on the log-scale.\nAnother example of nonlinear relation that can be analyzed using linear regression is when variables are related via a power law. This concept helps us model proportional relationships or ratios. In a multiplicative relationship, when one variable changes on a percent scale, the other changes in a directly proportional manner, as long as the multiplying factor remains constant. For example, the relation between the size of a city and the number of cars registered in the city is given by a power law. When the size of the city doubles, the number of cars registered in the city is also expected to double. The power law model is given by the formula \\[\ny = \\beta_0 x^{\\beta_1}.\n\\] If we apply the \\(\\log\\) function to both sides of the equation, we get \\[\n\\log y = \\log \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log x.\n\\] This is a linear relation between \\(\\log y\\) and \\(\\log x\\). Thus, we can use linear regression to estimate the parameters of the power law model by putting the output variable \\(y\\) and input variable \\(x\\) on the log-scale.\nHowever, there are several caveats when putting variables on the log-scale. We need to make sure that the variable is positive. This means that we cannot apply log transformations to dummy or count variables.\n\nExample 12.6 (World’s Smartest Mammal) We will demonstrate the power relation using data on brain (measured in grams) and body (measured in kilograms) weights for 62 mammal species. The data was collected by Harry J. Jerison in 1973.

We can check the residuals by plotting residuals against fitted values and plotting fitted vs true values.\nplot(model$fitted.values, model$residuals, pch=21, bg=\"lightblue\", xlab=\"Fitted y\", ylab=\"Residuals\")\nabline(h=0, col=\"red\", lwd=3)\nplot(Brain, model$fitted.values, pch=21, bg=\"lightblue\", xlab=\"True y\", ylab=\"Fitted y\")\nabline(a=0,b=1, col=\"red\", lwd=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.5: Fitted y vs Residuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.6: Fitted y vs True y\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember, that residuals should roughly follow a normal distribution with mean zero and constant variance. We can see that the residuals are not normally distributed and the variance increases with the fitted values. This is a clear indication that we need to transform the data. We can try a log-log transformation.\n\nmodel = lm(log(mammals$Brain)~log(mammals$Body))\nmodel %&gt;%  tidy() %&gt;% knitr::kable(digits=2)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n2.18\n0.11\n20\n0\n\n\nlog(mammals$Body)\n0.74\n0.03\n23\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(model$fitted.values, model$residuals, pch=21, bg=\"lightblue\")\nabline(h=0, col=\"red\", lwd=3)\nplot(log(Brain), model$fitted.values, pch=21, bg=\"lightblue\")\nabline(a=0,b=1, col=\"red\", lwd=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.7: Fitted y vs Residuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.8: Fitted y vs True y\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is much better! The residuals variance is constant and the plot of fitted vs true values shows a linear relationship. The log-log model is given by the formula \\[\n\\log \\mathrm{Brain} = 2.18 + 0.74 \\log \\mathrm{Body}.\n\\] seem to achieve two important goals, namely linearity and constant variance. The coefficients are highly significant.\nAlthough the log-log model fits the data rather well, there are a couple of outliers there. Let us print the observations with the largest residuals.\n\n# res = rstudent(model)\nres = model$residuals/sd(model$residuals)\noutliers = order(res,decreasing = T)[1:10]\ncbind(mammals[outliers,],\n      Std.Res = res[outliers], Residual=model$residuals[outliers],\n      Fit = exp(model$fitted.values[outliers])) %&gt;% knitr::kable(digits=2)\n\n\n\n\n\nMammal\nBrain\nBody\nStd.Res\nResidual\nFit\n\n\n\n\n11\nChinchilla\n64\n0.42\n3.41\n2.61\n4.7\n\n\n34\nMan\n1320\n62.00\n2.53\n1.93\n190.7\n\n\n50\nRhesus_monkey\n179\n6.80\n2.06\n1.58\n36.9\n\n\n6\nBaboon\n180\n10.55\n1.64\n1.26\n51.1\n\n\n42\nOwl_monkey\n16\n0.48\n1.44\n1.10\n5.1\n\n\n10\nChimpanzee\n440\n52.16\n1.26\n0.96\n167.7\n\n\n27\nGround_squirrel\n4\n0.10\n1.18\n0.91\n1.6\n\n\n43\nPatas_monkey\n115\n10.00\n1.11\n0.85\n49.1\n\n\n60\nVervet\n58\n4.19\n1.06\n0.81\n25.7\n\n\n3\nArctic_Fox\n44\n3.38\n0.92\n0.71\n22.0\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two outliers, the Chinchilla and the Human, both have disproportionately large brains!\nIn fact, the Chinchilla has the largest standardized residual of 3.41. Meaning that the predicted value of 4.7 g is 3.41 standard deviations away from the recorded value of 64 g. This suggests that the Chinchilla is a master race of supreme intelligence! However, after checking more carefully we realized that there was a recording error and the actual weight of an average Chinchilla’s brain is 6.4. We mistyped the decimal separator! Thus the actual residual is 0.4.\n\nabs(model$fitted.values[11] - log(6.4))/sd(model$residuals)\n\n 11 \n0.4 \n\n\nIn reality Chinchilla’s brain is not far from an average mammal of this size!\n\n\nExample 12.7 (Newfood) A six month market test has been performed on the Newfood product, which is a breakfast cereal. The goal is to build a multiple regression model that provides accurate sales forecasts. This dataset represents the outcome of a controlled experiment in which the values of the independent variables that affect sales were carefully chosen by the analyst.\nThe analysis aims to identify the factors that contribute to sales of a new breakfast cereal and to quantify the effects of business decisions such as the choice of advertising level, location in store, and pricing strategies.\n\n\n\nvariable\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nsales\nnew cereal sales\n\n\nprice\nprice\n\n\nadv\nlow or high advertising (\\(0\\) or \\(1\\))\n\n\nlocat\nbread or breakfast section (\\(0\\) or \\(1\\))\n\n\ninc\nneighborhood income\n\n\nsvol\nsize of store\n\n\n\nFirst, we need to understand which variables need to be transformed. We start by running the “kitchen-sink” regression with all variables. Then we perform diagnostic checks to assess model assumptions and identify potential issues. Based on these diagnostics, we decide which variables should be transformed. After running the new model with transformations, we perform additional diagnostics and variable selection to refine the model. Using the final model after transformations and eliminating variables, we examine what the largest Cook’s distance is to identify influential observations. Finally, we provide a summary of coefficients and their statistical significance.\nFirst, let’s examine the correlation matrix to understand the relationships between all variables in the dataset. This will help us identify potential multicollinearity issues and understand the strength and direction of associations between variables before building our regression model.\n\nnewfood = read.csv(\"../data/newfood.csv\")\nattach(newfood)\nnames(newfood)\n\n \"sales\"  \"price\"  \"adv\"    \"locat\"  \"income\" \"svol\"   \"city\"   \"indx\"  \n\n# knitr::kable()\nhead(newfood)\n\n\n\n\n\nsales\nprice\nadv\nlocat\nincome\nsvol\ncity\nindx\n\n\n\n\n225\n24\n0\n0\n7.3\n34\n3\n1\n\n\n190\n24\n0\n0\n7.3\n34\n3\n2\n\n\n205\n24\n0\n0\n7.3\n34\n3\n3\n\n\n323\n24\n0\n0\n8.3\n41\n4\n1\n\n\n210\n24\n0\n0\n8.3\n41\n4\n2\n\n\n241\n24\n0\n0\n8.3\n41\n4\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n# correlation matrix\ncm = cor(cbind(sales,price,adv,locat,income,svol))\ncm[upper.tri(cm, diag = TRUE)] = NA\n# knitr::kable(as.table(round(cm, 3)))\nas.table(round(cm, 3)) %&gt;% knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\nsales\nprice\nadv\nlocat\nincome\nsvol\n\n\n\n\nsales\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nprice\n-0.66\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nadv\n0.00\n0.00\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nlocat\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nincome\n0.16\n-0.13\n-0.75\n0.00\nNA\nNA\n\n\nsvol\n0.38\n-0.18\n-0.74\n-0.04\n0.81\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember, correlations between variables are not the same as regression coefficients (\\(\\beta\\)’s)!

The log(svol) coefficient is close to one!\nThe reason we don’t apply logarithms to adv and locat variables is because they are binary categorical variables (taking values 0 or 1). Taking the logarithm of 0 is undefined, and taking the logarithm of 1 equals 0, which would not provide any meaningful transformation. For binary variables, the exponential transformation in the final model interpretation directly gives us the multiplicative effect on sales when the variable changes from 0 to 1.\nRegarding the log(svol) coefficient being close to one (1.03), this suggests that sales scale approximately proportionally with store volume. A coefficient of 1.0 would indicate perfect proportional scaling, meaning a 1% increase in store volume would lead to a 1% increase in sales. Our coefficient of 1.03 indicates slightly more than proportional scaling—a 1% increase in store volume leads to a 1.03% increase in sales, suggesting some economies of scale or network effects in larger stores.\nOn the transformed scale (log-log model), \\[\n\\log sales=8.41 - 1.74 \\log price + 0.150 {\\text{adv}} + 0.001 {\\text{locat}} - 0.524 \\log inc  + 1.03 \\log svol\n\\] On the un-transformed scale, \\[\n\\text{sales} = e^{8.41} ( \\text{price} )^{-1.74} e^{ 0.15 \\text{adv} } e^{ 0.001 \\text{locat}} ( \\text{inc} )^{-0.524}  ( \\text{svol} )^{1.03}\n\\] In the log-log regression model, the relationship between sales and the continuous variables (price, income, and store volume) follows a power function relationship. This means that a 1% change in these variables leads to a proportional change in sales according to their respective coefficients. Specifically, a 1% increase in price leads to a 1.74% decrease in sales, a 1% increase in income leads to a 0.524% decrease in sales, and a 1% increase in store volume leads to a 1.03% increase in sales.\nIn contrast, the binary variables (advertising and location) follow an exponential relationship with sales. When advertising is present (adv=1), sales increase by a factor of e^0.15 = 1.16, representing a 16% improvement. Similarly, when a store is in a good location (locat=1), sales increase by a factor of e^0.001 = 1.001, representing a 0.1% improvement. This exponential relationship arises because these variables are binary (0 or 1) and cannot be log-transformed, so their effects are multiplicative on the original sales scale.\nThe log-log regression model reveals several important relationships between the independent variables and sales performance.\n\nPrice elasticity is \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{price}} = - 1.74\\). A \\(1\\)% increase in price will drop sales \\(1.74\\)%\n\\(\\mathrm{adv}=1\\) increases sales by a factor of \\(e^{0.15} = 1.16\\). That’s a \\(16\\)% improvement\n\nWe should delete the locat variable from our regression model because it is statistically insignificant. The coefficient for locat has a very small magnitude (0.001) and a high p-value, indicating that there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that this variable has no effect on sales. Including statistically insignificant variables in a model can lead to overfitting and reduce the model’s predictive accuracy on new data. By removing locat, we create a more parsimonious model that focuses only on the variables that have meaningful relationships with the outcome variable.\nNow, we are ready to use our model for prediction. predict.lm provides a \\(\\hat{Y}\\)-prediction given a new \\(X_f\\)\n\nmodelnew = lm(log(sales)~log(price)+adv+log(income)+log(svol))\nmodelnew  %&gt;% tidy() %&gt;% knitr::kable(digits=2)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n8.41\n1.37\n6.1\n0.00\n\n\nlog(price)\n-1.74\n0.22\n-8.0\n0.00\n\n\nadv\n0.15\n0.10\n1.5\n0.14\n\n\nlog(income)\n-0.52\n0.49\n-1.1\n0.29\n\n\nlog(svol)\n1.03\n0.25\n4.1\n0.00\n\n\n\n\nnewdata=data.frame(price=30,adv=1,income=8,svol=34)\npredict.lm(modelnew, newdata, interval=\"confidence\", level=0.99)\n\n  fit lwr upr\n1 5.2 4.9 5.5\n\n\nExponentiate-back to find \\(\\text{sales} = e^{5.1739} = 176.60\\).",

    "text": "12.3 Interactions\nIn many situations, \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) interact when predicting \\(Y\\). An interaction occurs when the effect of one independent variable on the dependent variable changes at different levels of another independent variable. For example, consider a study analyzing the effect of study hours \\(X_1\\) and a tutoring program \\(X_2\\), a binary variable where 0 = no tutoring, 1 = tutoring) on test scores \\(Y\\). Without an interaction term, we assume the effect of study hours on test scores is the same regardless of tutoring. With an interaction term, we can explore whether the effect of study hours on test scores is different for those who receive tutoring compared to those who do not. Here are a few more examples when there is potential interaction.\nExamples of potential interactions include whether gender changes the effect of education on wages, whether patients recover faster when taking drug A, and how advertisement affects price sensitivity. Interactions are particularly useful with dummy variables. We can build a kitchen-sink model with all possible dummies (day of the week, gender, etc.).\nIf we think that the effect of \\(X_1\\) on \\(Y\\) depends on the value of \\(X_2\\), we model it using a linear relation \\[\n\\beta_1 = \\beta_{10} + \\beta_{11} X_2\n\\] and the model without interaction \\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2\\) becomes \\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\beta_3 X_1 X_2 + \\epsilon.\n\\] The interaction term captures the effect of \\(X_1\\) on \\(Y\\) when \\(X_2=1\\). The coefficient \\(\\beta_3\\) is the difference in the effect of \\(X_1\\) on \\(Y\\) when \\(X_2=1\\) and \\(X_2=0\\). If \\(\\beta_3\\) is significant, then there is an interaction effect. If \\(\\beta_3\\) is not significant, then there is no interaction effect. The coefficients \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\beta_2\\) are called marginal effects.\nIn R:\n\nmodel = lm(y = x1 * x2)\n\nestimnates \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\beta_3 X_1 X_2 + \\epsilon\\), and\n\nmodel = lm(y = x1:x2)\n\nestimates only \\(y = \\beta_3 X_1 X_2 + \\epsilon\\)\nIf \\(\\beta_3\\) is significant there’s an interaction effect and we must leave \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\beta_2\\) in the model whether they are significant or not.\nWhen \\(X_2 = D\\) is a dummy variable with values of zero or one, we typically run a regression of the form \\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_1 \\star D + \\epsilon\\] The coefficient \\(\\beta_1 + \\beta_2\\) is the effect of \\(X_1\\) when \\(D=1\\). The coefficient \\(\\beta_1\\) is the effect when \\(D=0\\).\n\nExample 12.8 (Orange Juice) Understanding how advertising affects consumer price sensitivity is a fundamental question in marketing analytics. Do promotional campaigns make consumers more or less sensitive to price changes? To explore this question, we analyze a dataset from the orange juice category that includes sales data from 83 Chicagoland stores. This dataset provides rich information including price, sales volume (measured as log units moved), brand identity, and whether the product was featured in store displays or advertising circulars.\nLet’s begin by examining the structure of the data and the basic relationships between variables.\n\noj = read.csv(\"./../data/oj.csv\")\nknitr::kable(oj[1:5,1:10], digits=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstore\nbrand\nweek\nlogmove\nfeat\nprice\nAGE60\nEDUC\nETHNIC\nINCOME\n\n\n\n\n2\ntropicana\n40\n9.0\n0\n3.9\n0.23\n0.25\n0.11\n11\n\n\n2\ntropicana\n46\n8.7\n0\n3.9\n0.23\n0.25\n0.11\n11\n\n\n2\ntropicana\n47\n8.2\n0\n3.9\n0.23\n0.25\n0.11\n11\n\n\n2\ntropicana\n48\n9.0\n0\n3.9\n0.23\n0.25\n0.11\n11\n\n\n2\ntropicana\n50\n9.1\n0\n3.9\n0.23\n0.25\n0.11\n11\n\n\n\n\nmodel = lm(logmove ~ log(price)*feat, data=oj)\nmodel %&gt;%  tidy() %&gt;% knitr::kable(digits=2)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n9.66\n0.02\n588\n0\n\n\nlog(price)\n-0.96\n0.02\n-51\n0\n\n\nfeat\n1.71\n0.03\n56\n0\n\n\nlog(price):feat\n-0.98\n0.04\n-23\n0\n\n\n\n\nmodel = lm(log(price)~ brand-1, data = oj)\nmodel %&gt;%  tidy() %&gt;% knitr::kable(digits=2)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nbranddominicks\n0.53\n0\n254\n0\n\n\nbrandminute.maid\n0.79\n0\n382\n0\n\n\nbrandtropicana\n1.03\n0\n500\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset includes three major brands: Dominick’s (the store brand), Minute Maid, and Tropicana. We can visualize the price distributions and the relationship between price and sales for these brands.\nbrandcol &lt;- c(\"green\",\"red\",\"gold\")\noj$brand = factor(oj$brand)\nboxplot(log(price) ~ brand, data=oj, col=brandcol)\nplot(logmove ~ log(price), data=oj, col=brandcol[oj$brand], pch=20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot reveals that Tropicana commands premium pricing, while Dominick’s store brand is positioned as the value option. The scatterplot shows a clear negative relationship between price and sales, as expected from basic economic theory: higher prices lead to lower sales volume.\nA critical modeling decision is whether to use logarithmic transformations for our variables. Let’s examine the relationship between price and sales on both the original and log scales to determine which specification better captures the underlying relationship.\nFirst, we plot sales against price on the original scale:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pattern suggests a nonlinear relationship that might be better captured with a transformation. Next, we examine the relationship between price and log(sales):\n\nl1 &lt;- loess(logmove ~ price, data=oj, span=2)\nsmoothed1 &lt;- predict(l1) \nind = order(oj$price)\nplot(logmove ~ price, data=oj, col=brandcol[oj$brand], pch=16, cex=0.5, ylab=\"log(move)\")\nlines(smoothed1[ind], x=oj$price[ind], col=\"blue\", lwd=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this shows some improvement, the relationship still exhibits curvature. Finally, we examine the log-log specification:\n\npar(mar = c(4, 4, 0.1, 0.1), bty=\"n\")\nplot(logmove ~ log(price), data=oj, col=brandcol[oj$brand], pch=16, cex=0.5, ylab=\"log(move)\")\nfor(i in 1:3) {\n  brand_data &lt;- oj[oj$brand == levels(oj$brand)[i], ]\n  l2 &lt;- lm(logmove ~ log(price), data=brand_data)\n  smoothed2 &lt;- predict(l2)\n  ind &lt;- order(brand_data$price)\n  lines(smoothed2[ind], x=log(brand_data$price[ind]), col='blue', lwd=2)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe log-log specification produces a much more linear relationship. This makes economic sense: the relationship between price and sales is multiplicative rather than additive. A 10% increase in price leads to a proportional percentage decrease in sales, regardless of the starting price level. This constant elasticity model is the standard approach in demand analysis.\nOur central research question is whether featuring a product in advertisements affects consumers’ price sensitivity. We start with a baseline model that includes both log price and the advertising indicator: \\[\n\\log(\\mathrm{sales}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\log(\\mathrm{price}) + \\beta_2 \\mathrm{feat}.\n\\]\nHowever, this model assumes that advertising only shifts demand up or down, without changing how consumers respond to price. To test whether advertising actually changes price sensitivity, we need to allow the price coefficient \\(\\beta_1\\) to vary with advertising. We can model this by assuming that the price sensitivity depends linearly on the advertising indicator: \\[\n\\beta_1 = \\beta_3 +  \\beta_4\\mathrm{feat}.\n\\]\nSubstituting this into our demand equation gives us an interaction model: \\[\n\\log(\\mathrm{sales}) = \\beta_0 + (\\beta_3 +  \\beta_4\\mathrm{feat})\\log(\\mathrm{price}) + \\beta_2 \\mathrm{feat}.\n\\]\nExpanding this expression yields: \\[\n\\log(\\mathrm{sales}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_3\\log(\\mathrm{price}) +  \\beta_4\\mathrm{feat} \\times \\log(\\mathrm{price}) + \\beta_2 \\mathrm{feat}.\n\\]\nThe coefficient \\(\\beta_4\\) on the interaction term tells us how much price sensitivity changes when the product is featured in advertising. Let’s estimate this model and compare it to simpler specifications.\nFirst, we fit the basic model with only log price:\n\nlm(logmove ~ log(price), data=oj) %&gt;%  tidy() %&gt;% knitr::kable(digits=2)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n10.4\n0.02\n679\n0\n\n\nlog(price)\n-1.6\n0.02\n-87\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nThis simple model suggests a price elasticity of approximately -3.1, meaning a 1% increase in price leads to roughly a 3.1% decrease in sales.\nNext, we add brand effects and the advertising indicator without interactions:\n\nlm(logmove ~ log(price) + feat + brand, data=oj) %&gt;% \n  tidy() %&gt;% \n  knitr::kable(digits=2)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n10.28\n0.01\n708\n0\n\n\nlog(price)\n-2.53\n0.02\n-116\n0\n\n\nfeat\n0.89\n0.01\n85\n0\n\n\nbrandminute.maid\n0.68\n0.01\n58\n0\n\n\nbrandtropicana\n1.30\n0.01\n88\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we estimate the full model with the interaction between price and advertising:\n\nojreg &lt;- lm(logmove ~ log(price)*feat, data=oj)\nojreg %&gt;%  tidy() %&gt;% knitr::kable(digits=2)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n9.66\n0.02\n588\n0\n\n\nlog(price)\n-0.96\n0.02\n-51\n0\n\n\nfeat\n1.71\n0.03\n56\n0\n\n\nlog(price):feat\n-0.98\n0.04\n-23\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results reveal a striking finding: the interaction coefficient is -0.98, which is highly statistically significant. When products are not featured (feat = 0), the price elasticity is -0.96. However, when products are featured in advertising (feat = 1), the price elasticity becomes \\(-0.96 + (-0.98) = -1.94\\), essentially doubling in magnitude. This means that advertising makes consumers nearly twice as sensitive to price changes.\nThis result seems counterintuitive at first. We might expect that advertising would make consumers less price-sensitive by building brand loyalty or highlighting non-price attributes. Why would advertising increase price sensitivity?\nThe explanation lies in the promotional strategy employed by retailers. Let’s examine the pricing behavior during advertising campaigns:\n\npar(mar = c(4, 4, 0.1, 0.1), bty=\"n\") \ndoj = oj %&gt;% filter(brand==\"dominicks\")\npar(mfrow=c(1,3), mar=c(4.2,4.6,2,1))\nboxplot(price ~  feat, data = oj[oj$brand==\"dominicks\",], col=c(2,3), \n        main=\"Dominick's\", ylab=\"Price ($)\")\nboxplot(price ~  feat, data = oj[oj$brand==\"minute.maid\",], col=c(2,3), \n        main=\"Minute Maid\", ylab=\"Price ($)\")\nboxplot(price ~  feat, data = oj[oj$brand==\"tropicana\",], col=c(2,3), \n        main=\"Tropicana\", ylab=\"Price ($)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplots reveal the key insight: prices are systematically lower when products are featured (feat = 1) compared to when they are not (feat = 0). This is a classic promotional pricing strategy where advertising and price discounts are bundled together. Retailers use advertising to draw attention to temporary price reductions.\nThe increased price sensitivity we observe during advertising periods is not caused by the advertising itself making consumers more price-conscious. Rather, it reflects the fact that advertising campaigns coincide with periods of price variation, and consumers who respond to advertisements are precisely those who are most price-sensitive. The advertising serves as a signal that draws price-sensitive consumers into the market, creating a selected sample with higher elasticity.\nThis example demonstrates the importance of carefully interpreting interaction effects and understanding the underlying business practices that generate the data. What appears to be an advertising effect on price sensitivity is actually a selection effect driven by the correlation between advertising and pricing strategies.",

    "text": "12.4 Categorical Variables and Dummy Encoding\nIn our orange juice analysis, we want to understand how brand affects sales. Intuitively, we might want to include brand in our regression model:\n\\[\n\\log(\\mathrm{sales}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\log(\\mathrm{price}) + \\xcancel{\\beta_2\\mathrm{brand}}\n\\]\nHowever, we immediately encounter a problem: brand is a categorical variable, not a numerical one. We have three brands in our dataset - Dominick’s, Minute Maid, and Tropicana - but these are labels, not numbers. How can we incorporate such categorical information into a mathematical equation that requires numerical coefficients?\nThe solution lies in creating dummy variables (also called indicator variables). For a categorical variable with \\(k\\) categories, we create \\(k-1\\) binary variables, each taking the value 1 if the observation belongs to that category and 0 otherwise. One category is designated as the reference category and is represented when all dummy variables equal zero.\nFor our three-brand scenario, we create two dummy variables as shown in the table below:\n\n\n\nBrand\nIntercept\nbrandminute.maid\nbrandtropicana\n\n\n\n\nminute.maid\n1\n1\n0\n\n\ntropicana\n1\n0\n1\n\n\ndominicks\n1\n0\n0\n\n\n\nThis encoding transforms our regression equation into:\n\\[\n\\log(\\mathrm{sales}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\log(\\mathrm{price}) + \\beta_{21}\\mathrm{brandminute.maid} + \\beta_{22}\\mathrm{brandtropicana}.\n\\]\nFortunately, statistical software like R handles this transformation automatically when you include a categorical variable in your model specification:\n\nlm(logmove ~ log(price)+brand, data=oj) %&gt;% \n  tidy() %&gt;% \n  knitr::kable(digits=2)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n10.83\n0.01\n745\n0\n\n\nlog(price)\n-3.14\n0.02\n-137\n0\n\n\nbrandminute.maid\n0.87\n0.01\n67\n0\n\n\nbrandtropicana\n1.53\n0.02\n94\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 12.9 (Golf Performance Data) Dave Pelz has written two best-selling books for golfers, Dave Pelz’s Short Game Bible, and Dave Pelz’s Putting Bible. These books have become essential reading for serious golfers looking to improve their performance through data-driven analysis and scientific methodology.\nDave Pelz was formerly a “rocket scientist” (literally) at NASA, where he worked on the Apollo space program. His background in physics and engineering provided him with the analytical skills to revolutionize golf instruction through data analytics. His systematic approach to analyzing golf performance helped him refine his teaching methods and develop evidence-based strategies for improving players’ games. Through his research, Pelz discovered that it’s the short-game that matters most for overall scoring performance.\nOne of Pelz’s most famous findings concerns the optimal speed for a putt. Through extensive data collection and analysis, he determined that the best chance to make a putt is one that will leave the ball \\(17\\) inches past the hole, if it misses. This counterintuitive result challenges the common belief that golfers should aim to leave putts just short of the hole. Pelz’s research showed that putts hit with this specific speed have the highest probability of going in, as they account for the natural variations in green speed, slope, and other factors that affect putt trajectory.\nNow, we demonstrate how to use data to improve your golf game. We analyze the dataset that contains comprehensive year-end performance statistics for 195 professional golfers from the 2000 PGA Tour season. This rich dataset captures technicical abilities of the players as well as financial success (measured by the amount of prize money they made). Each observation represents season’s averages of the players’ performance and total prize money. List below shows the variables in the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nnevents\nThe number of official PGA events included in the statistics\n\n\nmoney\nThe official dollar winnings of the player\n\n\ndrivedist\nThe average number of yards driven on par 4 and par 5 holes\n\n\ngir\nGreens in regulation, measured as the percentage of time that the first (tee) shot on a par 3 hole ends up on the green, or the second shot on a par 4 hole ends up on the green, or the third shot on a par 5 hole ends up on the green\n\n\navgputts\nThe average number of putts per round\n\n\n\nWe will analyze these data to determine which of the variables nevents, drivedist, gir, and avgputts is most important for winning money on the PGA Tour.

According to our model, Glasson and Stankowski should win more money based on their performance statistics, but they are not achieving the expected earnings. This could be due to several factors: they might be performing well in practice rounds but struggling under tournament pressure, they could be playing in fewer high-payout events, or their performance metrics might not capture other important aspects of tournament success like clutch putting or mental toughness during critical moments.\n\n\n\nUnder-Performers\n\n\n\nname\nmoney\nPredicted\nError\n\n\n\n\n47\nFred Couples\n990215\n1978477\n-988262\n\n\n52\nKenny Perry\n889381\n1965740\n-1076359\n\n\n70\nPaul Stankowski\n669709\n1808690\n-1138981\n\n\n85\nBill Glasson\n552795\n1711530\n-1158735\n\n\n142\nJim McGovern\n266647\n1397818\n-1131171\n\n\n\n\n\nLets look at 2018 data, the highest earners are\n\n\n\nHighest earners 2018\n\n\nname\nnevents\nmoney\ndrivedist\ngir\navgputts\n\n\n\n\nJustin Thomas\n23\n8694821\n312\n69\n1.7\n\n\nDustin Johnson\n20\n8457352\n314\n71\n1.7\n\n\nJustin Rose\n18\n8130678\n304\n70\n1.7\n\n\nBryson DeChambeau\n26\n8094489\n306\n70\n1.8\n\n\nBrooks Koepka\n17\n7094047\n313\n68\n1.8\n\n\nBubba Watson\n24\n5793748\n313\n68\n1.8\n\n\n\n\n\nOverperformers\n\n\n\nOverperformers 2018\n\n\n\nname\nmoney\nPredicted\nError\n\n\n\n\n1\nJustin Thomas\n8694821\n5026220\n3668601\n\n\n2\nDustin Johnson\n8457352\n6126775\n2330577\n\n\n3\nJustin Rose\n8130678\n4392812\n3737866\n\n\n4\nBryson DeChambeau\n8094489\n3250898\n4843591\n\n\n5\nBrooks Koepka\n7094047\n4219781\n2874266\n\n\n6\nBubba Watson\n5793748\n3018004\n2775744\n\n\n9\nWebb Simpson\n5376417\n2766988\n2609429\n\n\n11\nFrancesco Molinari\n5065842\n2634466\n2431376\n\n\n12\nPatrick Reed\n5006267\n2038455\n2967812\n\n\n84\nSatoshi Kodaira\n1471462\n-1141085\n2612547\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderperformers\n\n\n\nUnderperformers 2018\n\n\n\nname\nmoney\nPredicted\nError\n\n\n\n\n102\nTrey Mullinax\n1184245\n3250089\n-2065844\n\n\n120\nJ.T.

The main function for the horseshoe for the linear regression model is horseshoe and it implements the algorithm of Bhattacharya et al (2016).\nThe options of horseshoe are the same as for HS.normal.means (discussed above, although in case of linear regression it is less clear which prior to use for \\(\\tau\\)). We illustrate the use of horseshoe via an example.\nWe create a 50 by 100 design matrix \\(X\\) filled with realizations of independent normal random variables.

    "text": "12.6 Quantile Regression\nThe least absolute deviations (Quantile) loss function is the sum of absolute differences between the predicted and actual values. It is used for regression problems with continuous variables. The goal is to minimize the sum of absolute errors (SAE) to improve the predictive performance of the model. Given observed data set the least absolute deviations estimator is the value of \\(\\beta\\) that minimizes the sum of absolute errors \\[\n\\mini_{\\beta}\\sum_{i=1}^n |y_i - f_{\\beta}(x_i)|\n\\] The least absolute deviations estimator is also known as the quantile estimator, where the quantile is set to 0.5 (the median). This is because the least absolute deviations estimator is equivalent to the median of the data (the 0.5 quantile).\nAgain, in the unconditional case, when we do not observe any inputs \\(x\\), the least absolute deviations estimator is the sample median. To solve this minimization problem, we need to consider the concept of a subgradient, since the absolute value function is not differentiable at zero.\nA subgradient generalizes the idea of a derivative for functions that are not differentiable everywhere. For a convex function \\(f(x)\\), a subgradient at a point \\(x_0\\) is any value \\(g\\) such that for all \\(x\\), \\[\nf(x) \\geq f(x_0) + g(x - x_0).\n\\] The set of all such \\(g\\) is called the subdifferential at \\(x_0\\).\nFor the absolute value function, the subgradient is given by: \\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} |x| =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } x &gt; 0 \\\\\n-1 & \\text{if } x &lt; 0 \\\\\n[-1, 1] & \\text{if } x = 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\] That is, at \\(x = 0\\), any value between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\) is a valid subgradient.\nApplying this to our minimization problem, the subgradient of the sum of absolute deviations with respect to \\(\\beta\\) is: \\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n \\operatorname{sign}(y_i - \\beta).\n\\] This equals to zero only when the number of positive items equals the number of negative which happens when \\(\\beta\\) is the median.\n\nA more rigorous and non-calculus proof is due to Schwertman, Gilks, and Cameron (1990). Let \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\) be the observed data and \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) be the least absolute deviations estimator. Then we have \\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n |y_i - \\hat{\\beta}| \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^n |y_i - \\beta|\n\\] for any \\(\\beta\\). Let \\(y_{(1)},\\ldots,y_{(n)}\\) be the ordered data. Then we have \\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n |y_i - \\hat{\\beta}| \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^n |y_i - y_{(i)}|\n\\] Let \\(y_{(n/2)}\\) be the median of the data. Then we have \\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n |y_i - \\hat{\\beta}| \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^n |y_i - y_{(n/2)}|\n\\] which implies that \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) is the median of the data.\nThe generalization of the median estimator to the case of estimating value of quantile \\(\\tau\\) is as follows \\[\n\\mini_{\\beta}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\rho_{\\tau}(y_i - \\beta)\n\\] where \\(\\rho_{\\tau}(x) = x(\\tau - \\mathbb{I}(x &lt; 0))\\) is the quantile loss function. If we set \\(\\tau = 0.5\\), the loss function becomes the absolute value function and we get the median estimator. The expected loss is \\[\nE \\rho_{\\tau}(y - \\beta) = (\\tau-1)\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\beta} (y-\\beta)dF(y) + \\tau\\int_{\\beta}^{\\infty} (y-\\beta)dF(y)\n\\] Differentiating the expected loss function with respect to \\(\\beta\\) and setting it to zero gives the quantile estimator \\[\n\\hat{\\beta}_{\\tau} = F^{-1}(\\tau)\n\\] where \\(F^{-1}\\) is the quantile function of the distribution of \\(y\\). Thus, the problem of finding a quantile is solved via optimization.\nA key difference between the least squares and least absolute deviations estimators is their sensitivity to outliers. The least squares estimator is sensitive to outliers because it squares the errors, giving more weight to large errors. In contrast, the least absolute deviations estimator is less sensitive to outliers because it takes the absolute value of the errors, giving equal weight to all errors. This makes the least absolute deviations estimator more robust to outliers than the least squares estimator.\nAnother difference is the computational complexity. Least squares estimator can be found by solving a linear system of equations. There are fast and efficient algorithms for it, making the least squares estimator computationally efficient. In contrast, the least absolute deviations estimator requires more computationally expensive numerical optimization algorithms.\nThere is also a hybrid loss function, called Huber loss, which combines the advantages of squared errors and absolute deviations. It uses SE for small errors and AE for large errors, making it less sensitive to outliers.\n\n\n\n\nSchwertman, Neil C, AJ Gilks, and J Cameron. 1990. “A Simple Noncalculus Proof That the Median Minimizes the Sum of the Absolute Deviations.” The American Statistician 44 (1): 38–39.",

    "text": "13.1 Model Fitting\nClassification is a type of predictive modeling where the goal is to predict a categorical variable based on a set of input variables. A categorical variable is a variable that can take on only a limited number of values, such as 0 or 1, or it can be a multi-class variable, meaning it can take on more than two values. For example, in medical diagnosis, we might want to predict whether a patient has a disease (1) or not (0) based on symptoms and test results. A particularly important application is in self-driving cars, where computer vision systems must classify objects in real-time from camera feeds - distinguishing between pedestrians, other vehicles, traffic signs, and road obstacles to make safe driving decisions.\nGiven observed data \\((x_i,y_i)_{i=1}^n\\), where each \\(y_i\\) is either 0 or 1, we start by assuming a binomial likelihood function for the response variable, defined as follows: \\[\nP(y_i = 1\\mid p_i) = p_i^{y_i} (1-p_i)^{1-y_i},\n\\] where \\(p_i\\) is the function of the inputs \\(x_i\\) and coefficients \\(\\beta\\) that gives us the probability of the response variable taking on a value of 1, given the input variables. A typical approach to calculate \\(p_i\\) is to use the logistic function \\[\\begin{align*}\nf_{\\beta}(x_i) = & \\beta^Tx_i\\\\\np_i  = & \\sigma(f_{\\beta}(x_i)) =  \\frac{e^{f_{\\beta}(x_i)}}{1+e^{f_{\\beta}(x_i)}},\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta\\) is a vector of parameters. The logistic function \\(\\sigma(\\cdot)\\) is a function that maps any real number to a number between zero and one.\nThen we fit the model using binomial log-likelihood minimization. It leads us to the maximum likelihood estimator for parameters \\(\\beta\\) (a.k.a cross-entropy estimator), defined as \\[\n\\hat \\beta = \\arg\\min_{\\beta}\\mathcal{L}(\\beta),\n\\] where \\[\n\\mathcal{L}(\\beta) =  -\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ y_i \\log p_i  + (1-y_i) \\log \\left ( 1-p_i \\right ) \\right].\n\\] Similar to the least squares estimator, the cross-entropy estimator optimization problem is convex, so it has a unique solution.\nIn the unconditional case, when we do not observe any inputs \\(x\\), the cross-entropy estimator is again, the sample mean. If we take the derivative of the above expression with respect to \\(\\beta_0\\) and set it to zero, we get \\[\n- \\frac{d}{d\\beta_0}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ y_i \\log \\left ( \\beta_0 \\right ) + (1-y_i) \\log \\left ( 1-\\beta_0 \\right ) \\right] = -\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ \\frac{y_i}{\\beta_0} - \\frac{1-y_i}{1-\\beta_0} \\right] = 0\n\\] which gives us the solution \\[\n\\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i.\n\\] which is the sample mean.\nUnlike the least squares estimator or the unconditional case, the system of equations \\[\n\\nabla \\mathcal{L}(\\beta) = 0\n\\] is not linear and cannot be solved by inverting a matrix. However, there are efficient iterative numerical optimization algorithms that can be used to find the optimal solution. The most common one is the BFGS (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) algorithm. It is a quasi-Newton method that’s particularly well-suited for optimizing the cross-entropy loss function in logistic regression.\nWhen we have more than two classes \\(y \\in \\{1,\\ldots,K\\}\\), we build \\(K-1\\) models \\(f_{\\beta_1}(x),\\ldots, f_{\\beta_{K-1}}(x)\\), one for each of the first \\(K-1\\) classes, while treating the \\(K\\)-th class as the reference class with \\(f_{\\beta_K}(x) = 0\\). We then use the softmax function to convert the outputs into probabilities:\nFor classes \\(j = 1, \\ldots, K-1\\): \\[\nP(y = j \\mid x) = \\frac{\\exp(f_{\\beta_j}(x))}{1 + \\sum_{i=1}^{K-1} \\exp(f_{\\beta_i}(x))}\n\\]\nFor the reference class \\(K\\): \\[\nP(y = K \\mid x) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\sum_{i=1}^{K-1} \\exp(f_{\\beta_i}(x))}\n\\]\nSome implementations of the logistic regression use \\(K\\) models, one for each class, and then use the softmax function to convert the outputs into probabilities. This is equivalent to the above approach, but it is more computationally expensive.\nThe vector of non-scaled outputs \\((f_{\\beta_1}(x),\\ldots, f_{\\beta_{K-1}}(x))\\) is called the logits.\nThe softmax function is a generalization of the logistic function to the case of more than two classes. It is often used as the activation function in the output layer of neural networks for multi-class classification problems. It converts the output of each model into a probability distribution over the classes, making it suitable for multi-class classification with probabilistic outputs.\nThe logistic function has a nice statistical interpretation. It is the CDF of the logistic distribution, which is a symmetric distribution with mean 0 and variance \\(\\pi^2/3\\), thus \\(p_i\\) is simply a value of this CDF, evaluated at \\(\\beta^Tx_i\\).\nFurther, Logistic regression models the log-odds (logit) of the probability as a linear function of the predictors, which aligns with the maximum likelihood estimation framework and provides desirable statistical properties. Specifically, if we invert the logistic function, \\[\np_i  = \\sigma(\\beta^Tx_i) =  \\frac{e^{\\beta^Tx_i}}{1+e^{\\beta^Tx_i}},\n\\] we get the log-odds \\[\n\\log\\left(\\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}\\right) = \\beta^Tx_i.\n\\] Meaning that \\(\\beta^Tx_i\\) measures how probability of \\(y_i = 1\\) changes with respect to the change in \\(x_i\\) on the log-odds scale. It allows us to interpret the model coefficients as the log-odds ratios of the response variable.\nIn some disciplines, such as econometrics, psychology and natural sciences, a normal CDF is used instead of the logistic CDF. It is done for historical reasons and because the normal CDF has slightly different assumptions about the data, that might be more natural in some cases.\nIn the case of the normal CDF, the model is called probit, it stands for probability unit, and the link function is called probit link. The probit model is defined as \\[\n\\Phi^{-1}(p_i) =  \\beta^Tx_i.\n\\] where \\(\\Phi(\\cdot)\\) is the normal CDF.\nThe term probit was coined in the 1930’s by biologists studying the dosage-cure rate link. We can fit a probit model using glm function in R.\nset.seed(92) # Kuzy\nx = seq(-3,3,length.out = 100)\ny = pnorm(x+rnorm(100))&gt;0.5\nprobitModel = glm(y~x, family=binomial(link=\"probit\"))\nmc = as.double(coef(probitModel))\n# we want to predict outcome for x = -1\nxnew = -1\n(yt = mc[1] + mc[2]*xnew)\n\n## [1] -0.86\n\n(pnorm(yt))\n\n## [1] 0.19\n\n(pred = predict(probitModel, list(x = c(xnew)), type=\"response\"))\n\n##    1 \n## 0.19\nnd = dnorm(mc[1] + mc[2]*x)\nplot(x,nd, type='l', col=\"red\", xlab=\"x\", ylab = \"P(y=1)\")\npolygon(c(-3,x[x&lt; -1],-1),c(0,nd[x&lt; -1],0), col=\"blue\")\nOur prediction is the blue area which is equal to 0.195.\nplot(x,y, type='p', col=\"red\", xlab=\"x\", ylab = \"P(y=1)\")\npred_probit = predict(probitModel, list(x=x), type=\"response\")\nlines(x,pred_probit, type='l')\nOutside of specific fields, i.e., behavioral economics, the logistic function is a much more popular choice compared to the probit model. Besides the fact that it is more intuitive to work with the logit transform, it also has several nice properties when we deal with multiple classes (more than 2). Also, it is computationally easier than working with normal distributions. The density function of the logit is very similar to the probit one.\nlogitModel  = glm(y~x, family=binomial(link=\"logit\"))\npred_logit = predict(logitModel, list(x = x), type=\"response\")\nplot(x,pred_probit, pch=20, col=\"red\", cex=0.9, ylab=\"y\")\nlines(x,pred_logit, type='p', pch=20, cex=0.5, col=\"blue\")\nlines(x,y, type='p', pch=21, cex=0.5, bg=\"lightblue\")\nlegend(\"bottomright\",pch=20, legend=c(\"Logit\", \"Probit\"), col=c(\"blue\",\"red\"),y.intersp = 2)\nNotice that the predict function returns a numeric value between 0 and 1. However, if we want to make a decision (to bet or not to bet), we need to have a binary outcome. A simple method to move between the predicted probability and binary value is to use thresholding. \\[\n\\hat y_i = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } \\hat p_i &gt; \\alpha \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } \\hat p_i \\leq \\alpha\n\\end{cases}\n\\] where \\(\\alpha\\) is a threshold value. A typical choice is \\(\\alpha = 0.5\\).\nNow let’s calculate the number of correct predictions using threshold \\(\\alpha = 0.5\\). R has a convenient table function that can summarize the counts of the predicted and actual values in a table.\ntable(NBA$favwin, as.integer(predict(nbareg, type=\"response\")&gt;0.5), dnn=c(\"Actual\", \"Predicted\"))\n\n##       Predicted\n## Actual   1\n##      0 131\n##      1 422\nOur model gets 0.7631103 of the predictions correctly. This number is called accuracy of the model.",

In our case, we have two predictors \\(x_1\\) = BPW.1 and \\(x_2\\) = BPW.2 and our model is \\[\n\\log\\left(\\dfrac{p}{1-p}\\right) = \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2,\n\\] where \\(p\\) is the probability of player 1 winning the match. We want to find the line along which the probability is 1/2, meaning that \\(p/(1-p) = 1\\) and log-odds \\(\\log(p/(1-p)) = 0\\), thus the equation for the line is \\(\\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 = 0\\) or \\[\nx_2 = \\dfrac{-\\beta_1}{\\beta_2}x_1\n\\]\nLet’s see the line found by the glm function\n\nlegend(\"bottomright\", c(\"P1 won\", \"P2 won\"), col=c(3,2), pch=21, bg=\"yellow\", bty='n')\n\nx = seq(0,30,length.out = 200)\ny  =  -m$coefficients[1]*x/m$coefficients[2]\nlines(x,y, lwd=2, col=\"red\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of observations. First, the effect of a break point on the game outcome is significant and symmetric; the effect of losing a break point is the same as the effect of winning one. We also can interpret the effect of winning a break point in the following way. We will keep BPW.2 = 0 and will calculate what happens to the probability of winning when BPW.1 changes from 0 to 1. The odds ratio for player 1 winning when BPW.1 = 0 is exp(0) which is 1, meaning that the probability that P1 wins is 1/2. Now when BPW.1 = 1, the odds ratio is 1.5\n\nexp(0.4019)\n\n## [1] 1.5\n\n\nWe can calculate probability of winning from the regression equation \\[\n\\dfrac{p}{1-p} = 1.5,~~~p = 1.5(1-p),~~~2.5p = 1.5,~~~p = 0.6\n\\] Thus probability of winning goes from 50% to 60%, we can use predict function to get this result\n\npredict.glm(m,newdata = data.frame(BPW.1 = c(0), BPW.2 = c(0)), type=\"response\")\n\n##   1 \n## 0.5\n\npredict.glm(m,newdata = data.frame(BPW.1 = c(1), BPW.2 = c(0)), type=\"response\")\n\n##   1 \n## 0.6\n\n\nWhat happens to the chances of winning when P1 wins three more break points compared to the opponent\n\npredict.glm(m,newdata = data.frame(BPW.1 = c(0), BPW.2 = c(0)), type=\"response\")\n\n##   1 \n## 0.5\n\npredict.glm(m,newdata = data.frame(BPW.1 = c(3), BPW.2 = c(0)), type=\"response\")\n\n##    1 \n## 0.77\n\n\nChances go up by 27%.\nTennis is arguably the sport in which men and women are treated equally. Both men’s and women’s matches are shown during prime-time on TV, and they both have the same prize money. However, one of the comments you hear often is that women’s matches are “less predictable”, meaning that an upset (when the favorite loses) is more likely to happen in a women’s match compared to men’s matches. We can test this statement by looking at the residuals. The larger the residual the less accurate our prediction was.\n\noutlind = which(d$res&lt;2)\nboxplot(d$res[outlind] ~ d$gender[outlind], col=c(2,3), xlab=\"Gender\",ylab=\"Residual\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s do a formal t-test on the residuals for men’s and women’s matches\n\nmen = d %&gt;% filter(res&lt;2, gender==\"M\") %&gt;% pull(res)\nwomen = d %&gt;% filter(res&lt;2, gender==\"W\") %&gt;% pull(res)\nt.test(men, women, alternative = \"two.sided\") %&gt;% tidy() %&gt;% kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nestimate\nestimate1\nestimate2\nstatistic\np.value\nparameter\nconf.low\nconf.high\nmethod\nalternative\n\n\n\n\n-0.07\n1.2\n1.3\n-4.7\n0\n811\n-0.11\n-0.04\nWelch Two Sample t-test\ntwo.sided\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference of \\(0.07\\) between men and women and the statistic value of \\(-4.7\\) means that the crowd wisdom that women’s matches are less predictable is correct.

    "text": "13.3 ROC Curve and Confounding Variables\nUsing default data set, we will illustrate the concept of ROC curve and confounding variables.\n\nExample 13.3 (Credit Card Default) We will use the Default data set from the ISLR package to illustrate the logistic regression. The data set contains information on credit card defaults. Credit risk assessment is a major application of logistic regression and is widely used in the financial industry. In fact, the banks with the best credit risk assessment models are the ones that are able to offer the best interest rates to their customers and are winning the market.\nWe will also use this example to illustrate the concept of ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve. That helps us to understand the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity by varying the threshold \\(\\alpha\\).\nFirst, load the data set. We have 10,000 observations.\n\nDefault = read.csv(\"../data/CreditISLR.csv\", stringsAsFactors = T)\nhead(Default)\n\n\n\n\n\ndefault\nstudent\nbalance\nincome\n\n\n\n\nNo\nNo\n730\n44362\n\n\nNo\nYes\n817\n12106\n\n\nNo\nNo\n1074\n31767\n\n\nNo\nNo\n529\n35704\n\n\nNo\nNo\n786\n38464\n\n\nNo\nYes\n920\n7492\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three predictors in the data set: balance, income and student. The balance variable represents the average credit card balance in dollars for each individual. This is the amount of money that a person owes on their credit card, which is a key predictor of whether they are likely to default on their credit card payments.\nIn the context of credit risk assessment, balance is one of the most important variables because it directly measures the amount of credit being utilized. Credit card companies and banks use this information, along with other factors like income and student status, to assess the likelihood that a customer will default on their payments. The logistic regression model we’re building will use this balance information to predict the probability of default, helping financial institutions make informed decisions about credit limits, interest rates, and risk management.\n\nglm.fit=glm(default~balance,data=Default,family=binomial)\nglm.fit %&gt;% tidy() %&gt;% kable()\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-10.65\n0.36\n-29\n0\n\n\nbalance\n0.01\n0.00\n25\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use it now to predict default for a new individual with a balance of $1000.\n\npredict.glm(glm.fit,newdata = list(balance=1000))\n\n##    1 \n## -5.2\n\n-1.065e+01 + 5.499e-03*1000\n\n## [1] -5.2\n\n\nNotice that by default the predict function returns the log-odds. We can convert it to the probability using the logistic function.\n\npredict.glm(glm.fit,newdata = list(balance=1000), type=\"response\")\n\n##      1 \n## 0.0058\n\nexp(-1.065e+01 + 5.499e-03*1000)/(1+exp(-1.065e+01 + 5.499e-03*1000))\n\n## [1] 0.0058\n\n\nNow, let’s plot the predicted probability of default for a range of balances between 1000 and 3000.\n\nx = list(balance=seq(1000,to = 3000,length.out = 100))\ny = predict.glm(glm.fit,newdata = x, type=\"response\")\nplot(x$balance,y, pch=20, col=\"red\", xlab = \"balance\", ylab=\"Default\")\nlines(Default$balance, as.integer(Default$default)-1, type='p',bg=\"lightblue\", cex=0.8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can calculate the confusion matrix for the model to see how well it predicts the default.\n\ny = predict.glm(glm.fit,newdata = Default, type=\"response\")\nconfusion_matrix = table(Default$default, as.integer(y&gt;0.2), dnn=c(\"Actual\", \"Predicted\"))\nconfusion_matrix\n\n##       Predicted\n## Actual    0    1\n##    No  9404  263\n##    Yes  134  199\n\n\nNotice that instead of using the default threshold of 0.5, we used 0.2. This is a common practice in the financial industry. The lower the threshold, the more likely the model is to predict a default. In other words, we only approve a loan to a person if the model predicts a default with probability 0.2 or lower.\nInstead of using counts in the confusion matrix, we can use rates\n\n# Convert to rates by dividing by row totals\nconfusion_matrix[1,] = confusion_matrix[1,] / sum(confusion_matrix[1,])  # Actual: NO row\nconfusion_matrix[2,] = confusion_matrix[2,] / sum(confusion_matrix[2,])  # Actual: YES row\n\nconfusion_matrix %&gt;% kable(digits=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n\n\n\n\nNo\n0.97\n0.027\n\n\nYes\n0.40\n0.598\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the rates (proportions) is a more typical way to present the confusion matrix.\n\nFor our predictions, we used the value of \\(\\alpha=0.2\\) as a cut-off. What if we use smaller or larger \\(\\alpha\\), e.g. \\(\\alpha=0\\)? We will use ROC curve to answer this question. ROC curve shows the relationship between sensitivity (true positive rate) and 1 - specificity (false positive rate) for different classification thresholds. Here, 1 - specificity is the proportion of negative cases that are incorrectly classified as positive. Thus, ROC curve shows both types of errors for different values of \\(\\alpha\\).\nFirst, we define a function that calculates the ROC curve.\n\nroc &lt;- function(p,y, ...){\n  y &lt;- factor(y)\n  n &lt;- length(p)\n  p &lt;- as.vector(p)\n  alpha = seq(0,1,length.out = 100)\n  Q &lt;- p &gt; matrix(rep(alpha,n),ncol=100,byrow=TRUE)\n  specificity &lt;- colMeans(!Q[y==levels(y)[1],])\n  sensitivity &lt;- colMeans(Q[y==levels(y)[2],])\n  return(list(specificity=specificity, sensitivity=sensitivity, alpha=alpha))\n}\n\nNow, let’s plot the ROC curve.\n\n## roc curve and fitted distributions\npred = predict.glm(glm.fit,newdata = Default, type=\"response\")\nres = roc(p=pred, y=Default$default)\nplot(1-res$specificity, res$sensitivity, type=\"l\", bty=\"n\", main=\"in-sample\", lwd=3)\nabline(a=0,b=1,lty=2,col=8)\ndef = Default$default\n# our 1/5 rule cutoff\npoints(x= 1-mean((pred&lt;.2)[def==\"No\"]), \n       y=mean((pred&gt;.2)[def==\"Yes\"]), \n       cex=1.5, pch=20, col='red') \n## a standard `max prob' (p=.5) rule\npoints(x= 1-mean((pred&lt;.5)[def==\"No\"]), \n       y=mean((pred&gt;.5)[def==\"Yes\"]), \n       cex=1.5, pch=20, col='blue') \nlegend(\"bottomright\",fill=c(\"red\",\"blue\"),\n       legend=c(\"alpha=1/5\",\"alpha=1/2\"),bty=\"n\",title=\"cutoff\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROC curve shows the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for different values of \\(\\alpha\\). The closer the curve is to the top-left corner, the better the model is. The diagonal line represents the random classifier (flip a coin for each prediction). The curve above the diagonal line is better than random, the curve below the diagonal line is worse than random.\nNow, let’s look at other predictors. We will add income and student to the model.\n\nglm.fit = glm(default ~ balance + income + student, \n              data=Default, family=binomial)\nglm.fit %&gt;% tidy() %&gt;% kable()\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-10.87\n0.49\n-22.08\n0.00\n\n\nbalance\n0.01\n0.00\n24.74\n0.00\n\n\nincome\n0.00\n0.00\n0.37\n0.71\n\n\nstudentYes\n-0.65\n0.24\n-2.74\n0.01\n\n\n\n\n\nThe p-values indicate that student is significant and income is not. However, the coefficient for student is negative. Meaning that students have lower probability of defaulting! This is counterintuitive, as one would expect that students have higher probability of defaulting. This is because the student variable and balance are confounded. We can see this by plotting the balance vs student.\n\nboxplot(balance~student,data=Default, ylab = \"balance\", col = c(2,3))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that students have higher balance on average. This is not surprising, as students are typically younger and have lower income, and many have student loans.\nConfounding occurs when the effect of one variable on the outcome is mixed with the effect of another variable, making it difficult to separate their individual contributions. In our case, student and balance are confounded.\nLet’s adjust for balance. We will plot the predicted probability of default for a range of balances between 1000 and 2500 for students and non-students.\n\nx1 = data.frame(balance = seq(1000,2500,length.out = 100), student = as.factor(rep(\"Yes\",100)), income=rep(40,100))\nx2 = data.frame(balance = seq(1000,2500,length.out = 100), student = as.factor(rep(\"No\",100)), income=rep(40,100))\ny1 = predict.glm(glm.fit,newdata = x1, type=\"response\")\ny2 = predict.glm(glm.fit,newdata = x2, type=\"response\")\nplot(x1$balance,y1, type='l', col=\"red\", xlab=\"Balance\", ylab = \"P(Default)\")\nlines(x2$balance,y2, type='l', col=\"black\")\nlegend(\"topleft\",bty=\"n\", legend=c(\"Not Student\", \"Student\"), col=c(\"black\",\"red\"), lwd=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that for a given balance, students are actually less likely to default than non-students. This is because students have higher balance on average.\nTo summarize what we’ve learned in this example thus far: ROC curves visualize the trade-off between sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (1 - false positive rate) across different classification thresholds. Curves closer to the top-left corner indicate better model performance, while the diagonal line represents random classification (AUC = 0.5). Curves above the diagonal are better than random, below are worse. ROC curves help choose optimal classification thresholds based on business requirements rather than default 0.5 cutoff.\nConfounding occurs when the effect of one variable on the outcome is mixed with the effect of another variable. In the Default dataset, student status and balance are confounded. Students have higher average balances due to student loans and lower income. Without controlling for balance, students appear more likely to default. After adjusting for balance, students are actually less likely to default. The solution is to include confounding variables in the model to isolate individual effects. Always consider variable relationships when interpreting coefficients.\n\nNow, a natural question is how to choose the cut-off value \\(\\alpha\\)? Assume a bank is using our logistic regression model to predict probability of a loan default and would issue a loan if \\(p(y=1) &lt; \\alpha\\). Here \\(\\alpha\\) is the level of risk bank is willing to take. If bank chooses \\(\\alpha=1\\) and gives loans to everyone it is likely to loose a lot of money from defaulted accounts. If it chooses \\(\\alpha = 0\\) it will not issue loan to anyone and wont make any money. In order to choose an appropriate \\(\\alpha\\), we need to know what are the risks. Assume, bank makes $0.25 on every $1 borrowed in interest in fees and loose the entire amount of $1 if account defaults. This leads to the following pay-off matrix\n\nPay-off matrix for a loan\n\n\n\npayer\ndefaulter\n\n\n\n\nloan\n0.25\n-1\n\n\nno loan\n-0.25\n0\n\n\n\nWe are making 25 cents on a dollar on a good loan and lose everything on a default!\nGiven this pay-off matrix, we can calculate the expected profit for the bank.\n\npred = predict.glm(glm.fit,newdata = Default, type=\"response\")\nres = roc(p=pred, y=Default$default)\nalpha = res$alpha\nspecificity = res$specificity # correctly detect default\nsensitivity = res$sensitivity # correctly detect non-default\n# We loose money when we make a mistake. If we issue a loan to a non-defaulting customer, we loose $0.25. If we dont issue a loan to a defaulting customer, we loose $1.\nprofit = 0*specificity - 1*(1-specificity) + 0.25*sensitivity - 0.25*(1-sensitivity)\nplot(alpha, profit, type='l', xlab = \"alpha\", ylab = \"profit\", lwd=3, col=\"red\")\nabline(h=0, lty=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s find the values of \\(\\alpha\\) for which profit is positive.\n\nmin(alpha[profit&gt;0])\n\n## [1] 0.02\n\nmax(alpha[profit&gt;0])\n\n## [1] 0.25\n\n\nWe have to be prudent and choose \\(\\alpha\\) in this range. Now let’s find \\(\\alpha\\) that maximizes the profit.\n\n# Find index of max value in profit\nalpha[which.max(profit)]\n\n## [1] 0.051\n\n\nThus, to maximize the profit, we only approve the loan if we are 95% sure that the customer will not default.\n\n\n\nExample 13.4 (LinkedIn Study) How to Become an Executive(Irwin 2016; Gan and Fritzler 2016)?\nLogistic regression was used to analyze the career paths of about \\(459,000\\) LinkedIn members who worked at a top 10 consultancy between 1990 and 2010 and became a VP, CXO, or partner at a company with at least 200 employees. About \\(64,000\\) members reached this milestone, \\(\\hat{p} = 0.1394\\), conditional on making it into the database. The goals of the analysis were the following\n\nLook at their profiles – educational background, gender, work experience, and career transitions.\nBuild a predictive model of the probability of becoming an executive\nProvide a tool for analysis of “what if” scenarios.

    "section": "13.4 Imbalanced Data",
    "text": "13.4 Imbalanced Data\nOften, you have much more observations with a specific label, such a sample is called imbalanced. This is a common problem in real-world classification tasks where one class significantly outnumbers the other(s). For example, in fraud detection, legitimate transactions vastly outnumber fraudulent ones; in medical diagnosis, healthy patients often outnumber those with rare diseases; and in manufacturing, defective products are typically much rarer than non-defective ones.\nWhen dealing with imbalanced data, you should avoid using accuracy as a metric to choose a model. Consider a binary classification problem with 95% of samples labeled as class 1. A naive classifier that simply assigns label 1 to every input will achieve 95% accuracy, making it appear deceptively good while being completely useless for practical purposes.\nInstead, more appropriate evaluation metrics should be used. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1-specificity) at various classification thresholds. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) provides a single scalar value that measures the model’s ability to distinguish between classes, regardless of the chosen threshold. An AUC of 0.5 indicates random guessing, while 1.0 represents perfect classification.\nThe F1 score combines precision and recall into a single score, providing a balanced measure that penalizes models that are either too conservative or too aggressive: \\[\nF1 = 2\\dfrac{\\mathrm{precision} \\times \\mathrm{recall}}{\\mathrm{precision} + \\mathrm{recall}}\n\\] where precision measures the proportion of true positives among predicted positives, and recall measures the proportion of true positives that were correctly identified.\nThe precision-recall curve is particularly useful for imbalanced datasets, as it plots precision against recall at various thresholds, focusing on the performance of the positive class. Cohen’s Kappa measures agreement between predicted and actual classifications while accounting for agreement by chance, making it more robust to class imbalance than accuracy.\nTo address imbalanced data, several strategies can be employed. Data-level approaches include oversampling, where you synthetically generate more samples of the minority class using techniques like bootstrap sampling with replacement, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) which creates synthetic examples by interpolating between existing minority class samples, or generative models like GANs or variational autoencoders to create realistic synthetic data. Undersampling reduces the majority class samples, which is particularly effective when the dataset is large enough. Hybrid approaches combine both oversampling and undersampling techniques.\nAlgorithm-level approaches include cost-sensitive learning, where you assign different misclassification costs to different classes, ensemble methods using techniques like bagging or boosting that can naturally handle imbalanced data, and threshold adjustment to modify the classification threshold to optimize for specific metrics like F1-score.\nThe choice of approach depends on the specific problem, available data, and computational resources. It is often beneficial to experiment with multiple techniques and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics rather than relying solely on accuracy.",

    "text": "13.5 Kernel Trick\nThe kernel trick is particularly valuable when dealing with complex, non-linear patterns in data that cannot be separated by simple linear boundaries. Many real-world classification problems exhibit such non-linear relationships, making the kernel trick an essential tool in machine learning.\nThe key insight is that while many problems appear intractable in their original feature space, they often become linearly separable when mapped to higher-dimensional spaces using appropriate kernel functions. This transformation allows us to apply powerful linear classification methods to solve complex non-linear problems efficiently.\nKernel trick is a method of using a linear classifier to solve a non-linear problem. The idea is to map the data into a higher dimensional space, where it becomes linearly separable. The kernel trick is to use a kernel function \\(K(x_i,x_j)\\) to calculate the inner product of two vectors in the higher dimensional space without explicitly calculating the mapping \\(\\phi(x_i)\\) and \\(\\phi(x_j)\\). The kernel function is defined as \\(K(x_i,x_j) = \\phi(x_i)^T\\phi(x_j)\\). The most popular kernel functions are polynomial kernel \\(K(x_i,x_j) = (x_i^Tx_j)^d\\) and Gaussian kernel \\(K(x_i,x_j) = \\exp(-\\gamma||x_i-x_j||^2)\\). The kernel trick is used in Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Gaussian Processes (GP).\n\n\nCode\ngencircledata = function(numSamples,radius,noise) {\n    d = matrix(0,ncol = 3, nrow = numSamples); # matrix to store our generated data\n    # Generate positive points inside the circle.\n    for (i in 1:(numSamples/2) ) {\n    r = runif(1,0, radius * 0.4);\n    angle = runif(1,0, 2 * pi);\n    x = r * sin(angle);\n    y = r * cos(angle);\n    noiseX = runif(1,-radius, radius) * noise;\n    noiseY = runif(1,-radius, radius) * noise;\n    d[i,] = c(0,x,y)\n    }\n\n    # Generate negative points outside the circle.\n    for (i in (numSamples/2+1):numSamples ) {\n    r = runif(1,radius * 0.8, radius);\n    angle = runif(1,0, 2 * pi);\n    x = r * sin(angle);\n    y = r * cos(angle);\n    noiseX = runif(1,-radius, radius) * noise;\n    noiseY = runif(1,-radius, radius) * noise;\n    d[i,] = c(1,x,y)\n    }\n    colnames(d) = c(\"label\", \"x1\", \"x2\")\n    return(d)\n}\n\n\n\nd = gencircledata(numSamples=200, radius=1, noise=0.001)\nplot(d[,2],d[,3], col=d[,1]+1, pch=19, xlab=\"x\", ylab=\"y\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data on the left in Figure 13.2 is clearly not linearly separable. However, if we map it to a three-dimensional space using the transformation: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\phi: R^{2} & \\longrightarrow R^{3} \\\\\n\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right) & \\longmapsto\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}\\right)=\\left(x_{1}^{2}, \\sqrt{2} x_{1} x_{2}, x_{2}^{2}\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] and attempt to linearly separate the transformed data, the decision boundaries become hyperplanes in \\(R^{3}\\), expressed as \\(\\omega^{T} z + b = 0\\). In terms of the original variables \\(x\\), these boundaries take the form: \\[\n\\omega_{1} x_{1}^{2} + \\omega_{2} \\sqrt{2} x_{1} x_{2} + \\omega_{3} x_{2}^{2} = 0,\n\\] which corresponds to the equation of an ellipse. This demonstrates that we can apply a linear algorithm to transformed data to achieve a non-linear decision boundary with minimal effort.\nNow, consider what the algorithm is actually doing. It relies solely on the Gram matrix \\(K\\) of the data. Once \\(K\\) is computed, the original data can be discarded: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nK & = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\nx_{1}^{T} x_{1} & x_{1}^{T} x_{2} & \\cdots \\\\\nx_{2}^{T} x_{1} & \\ddots & \\\\\n\\vdots & &\n\\end{array}\\right]_{n \\times n} = X X^{T}, \\\\\n\\text{where} \\quad X & = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}\nx_{1}^{T} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nx_{n}^{T}\n\\end{array}\\right]_{n \\times d}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Here, \\(X\\), which contains all the data, is referred to as the design matrix.\nWhen we map the data using \\(\\phi\\), the Gram matrix becomes: \\[\nK = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\phi\\left(x_{1}\\right)^{T} \\phi\\left(x_{1}\\right) & \\phi\\left(x_{1}\\right)^{T} \\phi\\left(x_{2}\\right) & \\cdots \\\\\n\\phi\\left(x_{2}\\right)^{T} \\phi\\left(x_{1}\\right) & \\ddots & \\\\\n\\vdots & &\n\\end{array}\\right].\n\\]\nLet us compute these inner products explicitly. For vectors \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) in \\(R^{3}\\) corresponding to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), respectively: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\langle r, s \\rangle & = r_{1} s_{1} + r_{2} s_{2} + r_{3} s_{3} \\\\\n& = a_{1}^{2} b_{1}^{2} + 2 a_{1} a_{2} b_{1} b_{2} + a_{2}^{2} b_{2}^{2} \\\\\n& = \\langle a, b \\rangle^{2}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThus, instead of explicitly mapping the data via \\(\\phi\\) and then computing the inner product, we can compute it directly in one step, leaving the mapping \\(\\phi\\) implicit. In fact, we do not even need to know \\(\\phi\\) explicitly; all we require is the ability to compute the modified inner product. This modified inner product is called a kernel, denoted \\(K(x, y)\\). The matrix \\(K\\), which contains the kernel values for all pairs of data points, is also referred to as the kernel matrix.\nSince the kernel itself is the primary object of interest, rather than the mapping \\(\\phi\\), we aim to characterize kernels without explicitly relying on \\(\\phi\\). Mercer’s Theorem provides the necessary framework for this characterization.\nLet’s implement it\n\nlibrary(\"scatterplot3d\")\nphi &lt;- function(x1, x2) {\n    z1 &lt;- x1^2\n    z2 &lt;- sqrt(2) * x1 * x2\n    z3 &lt;- x2^2\n    return(cbind(z1, z2, z3))\n}\n\n# Generate sample 2D data (you can replace this with your actual data)\n\n\n# Apply the transformation\ntransformed_data &lt;- phi(d[,2], d[,3])\nscatterplot3d(transformed_data, color = ifelse(d[,1] == 0, \"red\", \"blue\"), pch = 19,\n                xlab = \"z1 (x1^2)\", ylab = \"z2 (sqrt(2) * x1 * x2)\", zlab = \"z3 (x2^2)\",\n                main = \"3D Scatter Plot of Transformed Data\", angle=222, grid=FALSE, box=FALSE)",

While the probit model enjoys simple latent-variable methods for posterior sampling, the logistic model has historically required more complex approaches involving multiple layers of auxiliary variables or approximations(Polson, Scott, and Windle 2013). The breakthrough work of Polson, Scott, and Windle (2013) introduced a revolutionary data-augmentation strategy using a novel class of distributions called Polya-Gamma distributions, which enables simple and exact Gibbs sampling for Bayesian logistic regression(Polson, Scott, and Windle 2013).\nThis methodology represents a significant advancement in Bayesian computation, providing a direct analog to the Albert and Chib (1993) method for probit regression while maintaining both exactness and simplicity(Polson, Scott, and Windle 2013).

    "text": "13.7 The Polya-Gamma Distribution\nThe Polya-Gamma distribution, denoted as PG(b,c), is carefully constructed as a subset of infinite convolutions of gamma distributions(Polson, Scott, and Windle 2013).

The key theorem states:\n\nTheorem 1: For \\(b &gt; 0\\) and \\(a \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), the following integral identity holds:\n\\[\\frac{(e^\\psi)^a}{(1+e^\\psi)^b} = 2^{-b}e^{\\kappa\\psi} \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-\\omega\\psi^2/2} p(\\omega) d\\omega\\]\nwhere \\(\\kappa = a - b/2\\), and \\(p(\\omega)\\) is the density of \\(\\omega \\sim \\text{PG}(b,0)\\)(Polson, Scott, and Windle 2013).\nMoreover, the conditional distribution \\(p(\\omega|\\psi)\\) is also in the Polya-Gamma class: \\((\\omega|\\psi) \\sim \\text{PG}(b,\\psi)\\)(Polson, Scott, and Windle 2013).\n\n\n\nGibbs Sampling Algorithm\nThis integral identity leads directly to a simple two-step Gibbs sampler for Bayesian logistic regression(Polson, Scott, and Windle 2013). For a dataset with observations \\(y_i \\sim \\text{Binom}(n_i, 1/(1+e^{-\\psi_i}))\\) where \\(\\psi_i = x_i^T\\beta\\), and a Gaussian prior \\(\\beta \\sim N(b,B)\\), the algorithm iterates:\n\nSample auxiliary variables: \\((\\omega_i|\\beta) \\sim \\text{PG}(n_i, x_i^T\\beta)\\) for each observation\nSample parameters: \\((\\beta|y,\\omega) \\sim N(m_\\omega, V_\\omega)\\) where:\n\n\\(V_\\omega = (X^T\\Omega X + B^{-1})^{-1}\\)\n\\(m_\\omega = V_\\omega(X^T\\kappa + B^{-1}b)\\)\n\\(\\kappa = (y_1-n_1/2, \\ldots, y_n-n_n/2)\\)\n\\(\\Omega = \\text{diag}(\\omega_1, \\ldots, \\omega_n)\\)\n\n\nThis approach requires only Gaussian draws for the main parameters and Polya-Gamma draws for a single layer of latent variables, making it significantly simpler than previous methods(Polson, Scott, and Windle 2013).\n\n\nThe PG(1,z) Sampler\nThe practical success of the Polya-Gamma method depends on efficient simulation of Polya-Gamma random variables(Polson, Scott, and Windle 2013). The authors developed a sophisticated accept-reject sampler based on the alternating-series method of Devroye (1986)(Devroye 1986). For the fundamental PG(1,c) case, the sampler:\n\nUses exponential and inverse-Gaussian draws as proposals\nAchieves acceptance probability uniformly bounded below at 0.99919\nRequires no tuning for optimal performance\nEvaluates acceptance using iterative partial sums\n\n\n\nGeneral PG(b,z) Sampling\nFor integer values of b, PG(b,z) random variables are generated by summing b independent PG(1,z) draws, exploiting the convolution property. This approach maintains efficiency for moderate values of b, though computational cost scales linearly with the total number of counts in negative binomial applications.",

Its introduction of the Polya-Gamma distribution class and the associated data-augmentation strategy has enabled routine application of Bayesian methods to complex hierarchical models that were previously computationally prohibitive(Polson, Scott, and Windle 2013).\nThe BayesLogit package provides researchers and practitioners with efficient, well-tested implementations of these methods(Windle 2023). The combination of exact inference, computational efficiency, and theoretical guarantees makes the Polya-Gamma approach the method of choice for Bayesian logistic regression in most practical applications(Polson, Scott, and Windle 2013).\nAs computational demands continue to grow and models become increasingly complex, the Polya-Gamma methodology’s advantages become even more pronounced, establishing it as an essential tool in the modern Bayesian statistician’s toolkit (Tiao (2019)). Ongoing research continues to extend the Polya-Gamma methodology to new domains, including high-dimensional settings, nonparametric models, and integration with modern machine learning frameworks.\n\n\n\n\nDevroye, Luc. 1986.

    "text": "14.1 Building a Tree via Recursive Binary Splitting\nWe’ve used decision trees before to describe the decision-making process as a sequence of actions and conditions. In this section, we’ll use decision trees to make predictions. You can think of a prediction as a decision task, where you need to decide which value of \\(y\\) to use for a given \\(x\\). Similar to a decision tree, a predictive tree model is a nested sequence of if-else statements that map any input data point \\(x\\) to a predicted output \\(y\\). Each if-else statement checks a feature of \\(x\\) and sends the data left or right along the tree branch. At the end of the branch, a single value of \\(y\\) is predicted.\nFigure 14.1 shows a decision tree for predicting a chess piece given a four-dimensional input vector that describes the types of moves available to the piece. The tree is a sequence of nested if-else statements that check the values of the input vector. The tree has six leaves, one for each of the chess pieces and has a depth of four. The tree is a predictive model that maps a four-dimensional input vector to a single output categorical value with six possible values.\nThe prediction algorithm is simple. Start at the root node and move down the tree until you reach a leaf node. The process of building a tree, given a set of training data, is more complicated and has three main components:\nThe splitting process is the most important part of the tree-building process. At each step the splitting process needs to decide on the feature index \\(j\\) to be used for splitting and the location of the split. For a binary variable there is only one possible split location, but for continuous variables there are many possible split locations. The goal is to find the split that creates the most homogeneous subsets. In the case of regression trees, the best split is the one that minimizes the sum of squared errors. In the case of classification trees, the best split is the one that minimizes the Gini impurity. The Gini impurity is a measure of how homogeneous the subsets are.\nImagine you’re a jewelry appraiser tasked with determining a diamond’s value. You might follow a series of questions: Is the carat weight above 1.0? If yes, is the clarity VS1 or better? Each question leads to another, creating a decision path that eventually arrives at a price estimate. This is precisely how decision trees work—they mirror our natural decision-making process by creating a flowchart of if-then rules.\nBelow we’ll explore tree-based models using the classic diamonds dataset, which contains prices and attributes for 53,940 diamonds. We’ll start with simple decision trees, progress to ensemble methods like random forests and gradient boosting, and develop deep insights into how these algorithms work, when to use them, and how to avoid common pitfalls.\nLet’s start with a quick demo and look at the data, which has 10 variables\nLet’s plot price vs carat.\nNotice the strong non-linear relationship between carat and price. This suggests that log-transformations might help make the relationship linear.\nHowever, as we will see later tree models are not very sensitive to the linearity of the relationship between the predictors and the response. In general, we do not need to transform the variables.\nAlthough carat is the most important factor in determining the price of a diamond, it is not the only factor. We can see that there is a lot of variability in the price of diamonds with the same carat.\nLet’s start with a simple decision tree using just two predictors to visualize how trees partition the feature space:\nThe decision tree plot shows how the algorithm partitions the feature space based on carat and clarity to predict diamond prices. The tree structure reveals several interesting patterns:\nThis simple two-predictor tree demonstrates the key advantages of decision trees: they can handle non-linear relationships, provide interpretable rules, and naturally capture feature interactions without requiring explicit specification of interaction terms.\nLet’s plot the data.\nWe can see that for small and large diamonds, the price is consistently low and does not depend much on the clarity. However, at around 1 carat, we see some overlap in the price for different clarity levels. Clarity becomes important at this level\nNow let’s plot the data with the tree regions.\nThe plot above shows the decision tree’s prediction regions as colored tiles, where each tile represents a specific combination of carat and clarity values. The color gradient from blue to red indicates the predicted price, with darker red representing higher predicted prices.\nLooking at this visualization, we can see several key patterns. The strongest predictor is clearly carat, as evidenced by the vertical bands of similar colors. As carat increases (moving right on the x-axis), the predicted prices generally increase (colors shift from blue to red). The tree captures non-linear patterns that a simple linear model would miss. For example, the rate of price increase with carat is not uniform across all clarity levels. Unlike smooth regression surfaces, the tree creates distinct rectangular regions with sharp boundaries, reflecting the binary splitting nature of decision trees.\nThe prediction is rather straightforward. The tree divides the predictor space-that is, the set of possible values for \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_p\\) - into \\(J\\) distinct and non-overlapping boxes, \\(R_1,R_2,...,R_J\\). For every observation that falls into the region \\(R_j\\), we make the same prediction, which is simply the mean of the response values for the training observations in \\(R_j\\).\n\\[\nf(x) = \\bar y_j, \\text{ for } x \\in R_j, \\text{ where } \\bar y_j = \\text{Average}(y_i \\mid x_i \\in R_j)\n\\]\nThe overall goal of building a tree is to find regions that lead to minima of the total Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) \\[\n\\mathrm{RSS} = \\sum_{j=1}^J\\sum_{i \\in R_j}(y_i - \\bar{y}_j)^2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{minimize}\n\\]\nUnfortunately, it is computationally infeasible (NP-hard problem) to consider every possible partition of the feature space into \\(J\\) boxes. We can find a good approximate solution, using top-down approach (the CART algorithm).\nIt begins with the entire dataset at the “root” node and repeatedly splits the data into two “child” nodes. This process continues recursively on each new node, with the goal of making the resulting groups (nodes) as homogeneous as possible with respect to the target variable, price. At each iteration we decide on which variable \\(j\\) to split and the split point \\(s\\). \\[\nR_1(j, s) = \\{x\\mid x_j &lt; s\\} \\mbox{ and } R_2(j, s) = \\{x\\mid x_j \\ge s\\},\n\\] thus, we seek to minimize (in case of regression tree) \\[\n\\min_{j,s}\\left[ \\sum_{i:x_i\\in R_1}(y_i - \\bar{y}_1)^2 + \\sum_{i:x_i \\in R_2}(y_i - \\bar{y}_2)^2\\right]\n\\] As a result, every observed input point belongs to a single region.",

    "text": "14.2 Pruning: Taming an Overfit Tree\nNow let’s discuss how many regions we should have. At one extreme end, we can have \\(n\\) regions, one for each observation. Then the tree model will work similar to the one-nearest neighbor model. At the other end, we can have one big region for the entire input space and then every prediction will be the same (average across observed \\(y\\)’s). Both models can be used but usually the best one is in the middle. The number of regions (branches) controls the complexity of the model. We need to find a good size on the variance-bias scale. A smaller tree with fewer splits (that is, fewer regions \\(R_1,...,R_J\\)) might lead to lower variance and better interpretation at the cost of a little bias.\nHow do we construct a tree with a “manageable” number of branches? This is accomplished through the steps of forward tree construction and backward pruning. The forward step is a greedy algorithm that begins with a single region and divides it into two. This procedure is repeated until a certain stopping criterion is met. A practical method is to continue building the tree until the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) plateaus. However, this method can be myopic as an initially unproductive split might be followed by a highly beneficial one, leading to a significant decrease in RSS in subsequent iterations. A more effective strategy is to grow an extensive tree \\(T_0\\), and then trim it down to obtain a subtree. The size of the subtree can be determined using cross-validation. However, be aware that the number of subtrees can be exponential!\nInstead of considering all possible sub-trees, we will do cost complexity pruning - also known as weakest link pruning. We consider a sequence of trees indexed by a nonnegative tuning parameter \\(\\alpha\\). For each value of \\(\\alpha\\) there corresponds a subtree \\(T \\subset T_0\\) such that minimizes \\[\n\\sum_{m=1}^{|T|}\\sum_{i:x_i\\in R_m}(y_i - \\bar{y}_m)^2 + \\alpha |T|\n\\] The parameter \\(\\alpha\\) balances the complexity of the subtree and its adherence to the training data. When we increment \\(\\alpha\\) starting from zero, branches are predictably and sequentially pruned from the tree, making it straightforward to acquire the entire series of subtrees as a function of \\(\\alpha\\). We determine the optimal value \\(\\hat \\alpha\\) through cross-validation. Afterward, we refer back to the complete data set and extract the subtree that corresponds to \\(\\hat \\alpha\\).",

    "text": "14.3 Classification Trees\nA classification tree operates much like a regression tree. The prediction is made based on the “majority vote”, which means selecting the class that appears most frequently within the region. The process of developing a classification tree is largely the same as that of a regression tree, involving recursive binary splitting. However, instead of using the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS), we use the classification error rate, which is the proportion of observations in that region that do not belong to the most prevalent class.\nWe start by introducing some notations \\[\np_{mk} = \\dfrac{1}{N_m}\\sum_{x_i \\in R_m} I(y_i=k),\n\\] which is proportion of observations of class \\(k\\) in region \\(m\\).\nThe classification then done as follows \\[\np_m = \\max_k p_{mk},~~~ E_m = 1-p_m\n\\] i.e the most frequent observation in region \\(m\\)\nThen classification is done as follows \\[\nP(y=k) = \\sum_{j=1}^J p_j I(x \\in R_j)\n\\]\nAn alternative method to evaluate the quality of a split in a classification tree is through the use of the Gini Index or Cross-Entropy. Let’s consider a scenario where we have an equal number of observations in each class, say 400 in each.\nNow, suppose we create a tree that results in two regions: one with a distribution of (300,100) and the other with (100,300). This means that in the first region, 300 observations belong to one class and 100 to the other, and vice versa in the second region.\nConsider another scenario where we have a different tree that results in two regions with distributions of (200,400) and (200,0).\nIn both cases, the misclassification rate is 0.25, meaning that 25% of the observations are incorrectly classified. However, the second tree is more desirable. Why is that? The second tree has a region with no misclassifications at all (200,0), which means it is perfectly classifying all observations in that region. This is an ideal situation in classification problems. On the other hand, the first tree, despite having the same overall misclassification rate, does not have any region where all observations are correctly classified.\nThis illustrates that while the misclassification rate is a useful metric, it does not always capture the full picture. Other metrics like the Gini Index or Cross-Entropy can provide a more nuanced view of the quality of a split, taking into account not just the overall error rate, but also the distribution of errors across different regions.\nAnother way to measure the quality of the split is to use the Gini Index and Cross-Entropy Say, I have 400 observations in each class (400,400). I create a tree with two regions: (300,100) and (100,300). Say I have another tree: (200,400) and (200,0). In both cases misclassification rate is 0.25. The latter tree is preferable. We prefer to have more “pure nodes” and Gini index does a better job.\nThe Gini index: \\[\nG_m = \\sum_{k=1}^K p_{mk}(1-p_{mk})\n\\] It measures a variance across the \\(K\\) classes. It takes on a small value if all of the \\(p_{mk}\\)’s are close to zero or one.\nAn alternative to the Gini index is cross-entropy (a.k.a deviance), given by \\[\nD_m = -\\sum_{k=1}^Kp_{mk}\\log p_{mk}\n\\] It is near zero if the \\(p_mk\\)’s are all near zero or near one. Gini index and the cross-entropy led to similar results.\nNow we apply the tree model to the Boston housing dataset.\n\nlibrary(MASS); data(Boston); attach(Boston)\nhead(Boston)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncrim\nzn\nindus\nchas\nnox\nrm\nage\ndis\nrad\ntax\nptratio\nblack\nlstat\nmedv\n\n\n\n\n0.01\n18\n2.3\n0\n0.54\n6.6\n65\n4.1\n1\n296\n15\n397\n5.0\n24\n\n\n0.03\n0\n7.1\n0\n0.47\n6.4\n79\n5.0\n2\n242\n18\n397\n9.1\n22\n\n\n0.03\n0\n7.1\n0\n0.47\n7.2\n61\n5.0\n2\n242\n18\n393\n4.0\n35\n\n\n0.03\n0\n2.2\n0\n0.46\n7.0\n46\n6.1\n3\n222\n19\n395\n2.9\n33\n\n\n0.07\n0\n2.2\n0\n0.46\n7.2\n54\n6.1\n3\n222\n19\n397\n5.3\n36\n\n\n0.03\n0\n2.2\n0\n0.46\n6.4\n59\n6.1\n3\n222\n19\n394\n5.2\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst we build a big tree\n\nlibrary(tree)\ntemp = tree(medv~lstat,data=Boston,mindev=.0001)\nlength(unique(temp$where)) # first big tree size\n\n 73\n\n\nThen prune it down to one with 7 leaves\n\nboston.tree=prune.tree(temp,best=7)\nlength(unique(boston.tree$where)) # pruned tree size\n\n 7\n\n\ntext(boston.tree,col=\"blue\",label=c(\"yval\"),cex=.8)\nboston.fit = predict(boston.tree) #get training fitted values\nplot(Boston$lstat,Boston$medv,cex=.5,pch=16) #plot data\noo=order(Boston$lstat)\nlines(Boston$lstat[oo],boston.fit[oo],col='red',lwd=3) #step function fit\ncvals=c(9.725,4.65,3.325,5.495,16.085,19.9) #cutpoints from tree\nfor(i in 1:length(cvals)) abline(v=cvals[i],col='magenta',lty=2) #cutpoints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPick off dis,lstat,medv\n\ndf2=Boston[,c(8,13,14)]\nprint(names(df2))\n\n \"dis\"   \"lstat\" \"medv\" \n\n\nBuild the big tree\n\ntemp = tree(medv~.,df2,mindev=.0001)\nlength(unique(temp$where)) #\n\n 74\n\n\nThen prune it down to one with 7 leaves\n\nboston.tree=prune.tree(temp,best=7)\n\nplot(boston.tree,type=\"u\")# plot tree and partition in x.\ntext(boston.tree,col=\"blue\",label=c(\"yval\"),cex=.8)\npartition.tree(boston.tree)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet predictions on 2d grid\n\npv=seq(from=.01,to=.99,by=.05)\nx1q = quantile(df2$lstat,probs=pv)\nx2q = quantile(df2$dis,probs=pv)\nxx = expand.grid(x1q,x2q) #matrix with two columns using all combinations of x1q and x2q\ndfpred = data.frame(dis=xx[,2],lstat=xx[,1])\nlmedpred = predict(boston.tree,dfpred)\n\nMake perspective plot\n\npersp(x1q,x2q,matrix(lmedpred,ncol=length(x2q),byrow=T),\n theta=150,xlab='dis',ylab='lstat',zlab='medv',\n zlim=c(min(df2$medv),1.1*max(df2$medv)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages of Decision Trees: Decision trees are incredibly intuitive and simple to explain, often even more straightforward to understand than linear regression models. Some theorists argue that decision trees mimic human decision-making processes more accurately than other regression and classification methods we’ve discussed in previous chapters. Decision trees can be visually represented, making them easily interpretable, even for those without a deep understanding of the underlying mechanics, particularly when the trees are not overly complex. Additionally, decision trees can effortlessly manage qualitative predictors, eliminating the need to create dummy variables.\nDisadvantages of Decision Trees: Large trees can exhibit high variance, meaning that a minor change in the data can lead to a significant change in the final estimated tree, making the model unstable. Conversely, small trees, while more stable, may not be powerful predictors as they might oversimplify the problem. It can be challenging to find a balance between bias and variance when using decision trees. A model with too much bias oversimplifies the problem and performs poorly, while a model with too much variance overfits the data and may not generalize well to unseen data.\nThere are several techniques used to address the issue of overfitting in decision trees. We considered the pruning technique which reduces the complexity of the final classifier, and hence improve predictive accuracy by reducing overfitting. Two other methods are random forests and boosting. Random Forests is an ensemble method where multiple decision trees are created and their predictions are averaged (for regression) or majority voting is done (for classification). Boosting is another ensemble technique where trees are built sequentially such that each subsequent tree aims to reduce the bias of the combined classifier.\nIn the bagging approach, we treat the sample as if it were the population and then take iid draws. That is, you sample with replacement so that you can get the same original sample value more than once in a bootstrap sample.\nTo Bootsrap Aggregate (Bag) we:\n\nTake \\(B\\) bootstrap samples from the training data, each of the same size as the training data.\nFit a large tree to each bootstrap sample (we know how to do this fast!). This will give us \\(B\\) trees.\nCombine the results from each of the B trees to get an overall prediction.\n\nWhen the target variable \\(y\\) is numeric, the bagging process is straightforward. The final prediction is simply the average of the predictions from each of the \\(B\\) trees. However, when \\(y\\) is categorical, the process of combining results from different trees is less straightforward. One common approach is to use a voting system. In this system, each tree in the ensemble makes a prediction for a given input \\(x\\). The predicted category that receives the most votes (out of \\(B\\) total votes) is chosen as the final prediction. Another approach is to average the predicted probabilities \\(\\hat p\\) from each tree. This method can provide a more nuanced prediction, especially in cases where the voting results are close.\nDespite the potential benefits of averaging predicted probabilities, most software implementations of bagging for decision trees use the voting method. This is likely due to its simplicity and intuitive appeal. However, the best method to use can depend on the specific characteristics of the problem at hand.\nThe simple idea behind every ensemble method is that the variance of the average is lower than the variance of individual models. Say we have \\(B\\) models \\(f_1(x),\\ldots,f_B(x)\\) then we combine those \\[\nf_{avg}(x) = \\dfrac{1}{B}\\sum_{b=1}^Bf_b(x)\n\\] Combining models helps fight overfitting. On the negative side, it is harder to interpret these ensembles\nLet’s experiment with the number of trees in the model\n\nlibrary(randomForest)\nn = nrow(Boston)\nntreev = c(10,500,5000)\nfmat = matrix(0,n,3)\nfor(i in 1:3) {\n rffit = randomForest(medv~lstat,data=Boston,ntree=ntreev[i],maxnodes=15)\n fmat[,i] = predict(rffit)\n print(mean((fmat[,i] - Boston$medv)^2, na.rm = TRUE))\n}\n\n 30\n 29\n 29\n\n\nLet’s plot the results\noo = order(Boston$lstat)\nfor(i in 1:3) {\n plot(Boston$lstat,Boston$medv,xlab='lstat',ylab='medv',pch=16)\n lines(Boston$lstat[oo],fmat[oo,i],col=i+1,lwd=3)\n title(main=paste('bagging ntrees = ',ntreev[i]))\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith 10 trees our fit is too jumbly.\nWith 1,000 and 5,000 trees the fit is not bad and very similar.\nNote that although our method is based multiple trees (average over) so we no longer have a simple step function!!",

This happens because most, if not all, of the trees will use the most influential predictor in the top split. As a result, bagged trees tend to look very similar to each other.\nRandom Forests, on the other hand, introduce an element of randomness that helps to decorrelate the trees, making the ensemble more robust and improving prediction accuracy. This randomness comes into play when considering a split in a tree. Instead of considering all \\(p\\) predictors for a split, a random sample of \\(m\\) predictors is chosen as split candidates. This subset of predictors is different for each split, which means that different trees are likely to use different predictors in the top split, leading to a more diverse set of trees.\nThe number of predictors considered at each split, \\(m\\), is typically chosen to be the square root of the total number of predictors, \\(p\\). This choice is a rule of thumb that often works well in practice, but it can be tuned based on the specific characteristics of the dataset.\nBy decorrelating the trees, Random Forests can often achieve better performance than bagging, especially when there’s a small number of very strong predictors in the dataset. In such cases, bagging can end up with an ensemble of very similar trees that all rely heavily on these strong predictors, while Random Forests can leverage the other, weaker predictors more effectively.\nOne of the “interpretation” tools that comes with ensemble models is importance ranking: the total amount that the deviance (loss) is decreased due to splits over a given predictor, averaged over all trees\n\nrf.boston = randomForest(medv~.,data=Boston,mtry=4,importance=TRUE,ntree=50)\nvarImpPlot(rf.boston,pch=21,bg=\"lightblue\",main=\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrf.boston = randomForest(medv~.,data=Boston,mtry=6,ntree=50, maxnodes=50)\nyhat.rf = predict(rf.boston,newdata=Boston)\noo=order(Boston$lstat)\nplot(Boston$lstat[oo],Boston$medv[oo],pch=21,bg=\"grey\", xlab=\"lstat\", ylab=\"medv\") #plot data\nlines(Boston$lstat[oo],yhat.rf[oo],col='red',lwd=3) #step function fit",

However, the approach it takes is quite distinct.\nHere’s how Boosting works:\n\nInitially, a single decision tree is fitted to the data.\nThis initial tree is intentionally made weak, meaning it doesn’t perfectly fit the data.\nWe then examine the residuals, which represent the portion of the target variable \\(y\\) not explained by the weak tree.\nA new tree is then fitted to these residuals, essentially trying to predict the error of the first tree.\nThis new tree is also “weakened” or “shrunk”. The prediction from this tree is then added to the prediction of the first tree.\nThis process is repeated iteratively. In each iteration, a new tree is fitted to the residuals of the current ensemble of trees, shrunk, and then added to the ensemble.\nThe final model is the sum of all these “shrunk” trees. The key idea behind Boosting is to iteratively improve the model by focusing on the parts of the data that the current model is not explaining well (the residuals). Each new tree is trying to correct the mistakes of the ensemble of previous trees. By adding together many weak models (the shrunk trees), Boosting can often achieve a strong overall model.\n\nPick a loss function \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) that reflects setting; e.g., for continuous \\(y\\), could take \\(\\mathcal{L}(y_i , \\theta_i ) = (y_i - \\theta_i )^2\\) Want to solve \\[\\mathrm{minimize}_{\\beta \\in R^M} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathcal{L} \\left(y_i, \\sum_{j=1}^M \\beta_j \\cdot T_j(x_i)\\right)\\]\n\nIndexes all trees of a fixed size (e.g., depth = 5), so \\(M\\) is huge\nSpace is simply too big to optimize\nGradient boosting: basically a version of gradient descent that is forced to work with trees\nFirst think of optimization as \\(\\min_\\theta f (\\theta)\\), over predicted values \\(\\theta\\) (subject to \\(\\theta\\) coming from trees)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet \\(f_1(x)=0\\) (constant predictor) and \\(r_i=y_i\\)\nFor \\(b=1,2,\\ldots,B\\)\n\nFit a tree \\(f_b\\) with \\(d\\) splits to the training set \\((X,r)\\)\nUpdate the model \\[f(x) = f(x) +\\lambda f_b(x)\\]\nUpdate the residuals \\[r_i=r_i - \\lambda f_b(x)\\]\n\nHere are some boosting fits where we vary the number of trees, but fix the depth at 2 (suitable with 1 x) and shrinkage = \\(\\lambda\\) at .2.\n\nlibrary(gbm)\nboost.boston=gbm(medv~.,data=Boston,distribution=\"gaussian\",n.trees=5000,interaction.depth=4)\nyhat.boost=predict(boost.boston,newdata=Boston,n.trees=5000)\nmean((yhat.boost-Boston$medv)^2)\n\n 4e-04\n\n\n\nsummary(boost.boston, plotit=FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvar\nrel.inf\n\n\n\n\nlstat\nlstat\n36.32\n\n\nrm\nrm\n30.98\n\n\ndis\ndis\n7.63\n\n\ncrim\ncrim\n5.09\n\n\nnox\nnox\n4.63\n\n\nage\nage\n4.50\n\n\nblack\nblack\n3.45\n\n\nptratio\nptratio\n3.11\n\n\ntax\ntax\n1.74\n\n\nrad\nrad\n1.17\n\n\nindus\nindus\n0.87\n\n\nchas\nchas\n0.39\n\n\nzn\nzn\n0.13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(boost.boston,i=\"rm\")\nplot(boost.boston,i=\"lstat\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages of Boosting over Random Forests include performance and model interpretability. Boosting, in many cases, provides better predictive accuracy than Random Forests. By focusing on the residuals or mistakes, Boosting can incrementally improve model performance. While both methods are not as interpretable as a single decision tree, Boosting models can sometimes be more interpretable than Random Forests, especially when the number of weak learners (trees) is small.\nDisadvantages of Boosting compared to Random Forests include computational complexity, overfitting potential, and sensitivity to outliers and noise. Boosting can be more computationally intensive than Random Forests because trees are built sequentially in Boosting, while in Random Forests they are built independently and can be parallelized. Boosting can overfit the training data if the number of trees is too large or if the trees are too complex. This is less of a problem with Random Forests, which are less prone to overfitting due to the randomness injected into the tree building process. Boosting can also be sensitive to outliers since it tries to correct the mistakes of the predecessors, while Random Forests are more robust to outliers. Finally, Boosting can overemphasize instances that are hard to classify and can overfit to noise, whereas Random Forests are more robust to noise.\nRemember, the choice between Boosting and Random Forests (or any other model) should be guided by the specific requirements of your task, including the nature of your data, the computational resources available, and the trade-off between interpretability and predictive accuracy.",

    "section": "14.6 Finding Good Bayes Predictors",
    "text": "14.6 Finding Good Bayes Predictors\nThe ensemble methods we’ve discussed—bagging, random forests, and boosting—all share a common goal: improving predictive performance by combining multiple weak learners. But what is the theoretical foundation for why these methods work so well? And how do we determine the optimal way to combine these predictors? These questions lead us naturally to a Bayesian perspective on prediction, which provides both theoretical justification and practical guidance for ensemble methods.\nBayesian methods tackle the problem of good predictive performance in a number of ways. The goal is to find a good predictive MSE \\(E_{Y,\\hat{Y}}(\\Vert\\hat{Y} - Y \\Vert^2)\\). First, Stein shrinkage (a.k.a regularization with an \\(\\ell_2\\) norm) has long been known to provide good mean squared error properties in estimation, namely \\(E(||\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta||^2)\\) as well. These gains translate into predictive performance (in an iid setting) for \\(E(||\\hat{Y}-Y||^2)\\). One of the main issues is how to tune the amount of regularisation (a.k.a prior hyper-parameters). Stein’s unbiased estimator of risk provides a simple empirical rule to address this problem, as does cross-validation. From a Bayes perspective, the marginal likelihood (and full marginal posterior) provides a natural method for hyper-parameter tuning. The issue is computational tractability and scalability. The posterior for \\((W,b)\\) is extremely high dimensional and multimodal and posterior MAP provides good predictors \\(\\hat{Y}(X)\\).\nBayes conditional averaging can also perform well in high dimensional regression and classification problems. High dimensionality brings with it the curse of dimensionality and it is instructive to understand why certain kernel can perform badly.\nAdaptive Kernel predictors (a.k.a. smart conditional averager) are of the form\n\\[\n\\hat{Y}(X) = \\sum_{r=1}^R K_r ( X_i , X ) \\hat{Y}_r (X)\n\\]\nHere \\(\\hat{Y}_r(X)\\) is a deep predictor with its own trained parameters. For tree models, the kernel \\(K_r( X_i , X)\\) is a cylindrical region \\(R_r\\) (open box set). Figure 14.2 illustrates the implied kernels for trees (cylindrical sets) and random forests. Not many points will be neighbors in high-dimensional input space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.2: Cylindrical kernels for trees (left) and random forests (right).\n\n\n\nConstructing the regions is fundamental to reducing the curse of dimensionality. It is useful to imagine a very large dataset, e.g., 100k images, and think about how a new image’s input coordinates, \\(X\\), are “neighbors” to data points in the training set. Our predictor will then be a smart conditional average of the observed outputs, \\(Y\\), for our neighbors. When \\(p\\) is large, spheres (\\(L^2\\) balls or Gaussian kernels) are terrible: either no points or all points are “neighbors” of the new input variable. Trees are good as not too many “neighbors”.\nTo illustrate the problem further, Figure 14.3 below shows the 2D image of 1000 uniform samples from a 50-dimensional ball \\(B_{50}\\). The image is calculated as \\(w^T Y\\), where \\(w = (1,1,0,\\ldots,0)\\) and \\(Y \\sim U(B_{50})\\). Samples are centered around the equators and none of the samples fall close to the boundary of the set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.3\n\n\n\nAs dimensionality of the space grows, the variance of the marginal distribution goes to zero. We can empirically see it from Figure 14.4, which shows histogram of 1D image of uniform sample from balls of different dimensionality, i.e. \\(e_1^T Y\\), where \\(e_1 = (1,0,\\ldots,0)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.4: Histogram of marginal distribution of \\(Y\\sim U(B_p)\\) for different dimensions \\(p\\).\n\n\n\nSimilar central limit results were known to Maxwell who showed that random variable \\(w^TY\\) is close to standard normal, when \\(Y \\sim U(B_p)\\), \\(p\\) is large, and \\(w\\) is a unit vector (lies on the boundary of the ball). For the history of this fact, see Diaconis and Freedman (1987). More general results in this direction were obtained in Klartag (2007). Further, Milman and Schechtman (2009) presents many analytical and geometrical results for finite dimensional normed spaces, as the dimension grows to infinity.\nDeep learning improves on this by performing a sequence of GLM-like transformations; effectively, DL learns a distributed partition of the input space. Specifically, suppose that we have \\(K\\) partitions. Then the DL predictor takes the form of a weighted average, or in the case of classification, a soft-max of the weighted average of observations in this partition. Given a new high-dimensional input \\(X_{\\mathrm{new}}\\), many deep learners are an average of learners obtained by our hyperplane decomposition. Generically, we have\n\\[\n\\hat{Y}(X) = \\sum_{k \\in K} w_k(X)\\hat{Y}_k(X),\n\\] where \\(w_k\\) are the weights learned in region \\(k\\), and \\(w_k(X)\\) is an indicator of the region with appropriate weighting given the training data. The weight \\(w_k\\) also indicates which partition the new \\(X_{\\mathrm{new}}\\) lies in.\nThe use of pooling (a.k.a. averaging) of multiple predictors is commonplace in machine learning. Ensemble methods (a.k.a. some form of clever conditional averaging) are prevalent in high dimensions. One reason for these procedures is that it is relatively easy to find unbiased predictors, with the caveat that they have large variances due to dimensionality. The following result on exchangeability (Kingman, 1975) shows that we can simply use the \\(1/N\\)-rule and average to reduce risk. Specifically, suppose that we have \\(K\\) exchangeable, \\(\\mathbb{E} ( \\hat{Y}_i ) = \\mathbb{E} ( \\hat{Y}_{\\pi(i)} )\\), predictors\n\\[\n\\hat{Y} = ( \\hat{Y}_1 , \\ldots , \\hat{Y}_K )\n\\]\nFind \\(w\\) to attain \\(\\operatorname{argmin}_W E l( Y , w^T \\hat{Y} )\\) where \\(l\\) convex in the second argument;\n\\[\nE l( Y , w^T \\hat{Y} ) = \\frac{1}{K!} \\sum_\\pi E l( Y , w^T \\hat{Y} ) \\geq E l \\left ( Y , \\frac{1}{K!} \\sum_\\pi w_\\pi^T \\hat{Y} )\\right ) = E l \\left ( Y , (1/K) \\iota^T \\hat{Y} \\right )\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\iota = ( 1 , \\ldots ,1 )\\). Hence, the randomized multiple predictor with weights \\(w = (1/K)\\iota\\) provides close to optimal Bayes predictive performance. We now turn to algorithmic issues.\nAn alternative approach is to perform Bayesian model selection. Here we calculate the optimal Bayes weight for each predictor in accordance with Bayes Rule. We formalize the gains in Classification Risk with the following discussion.",

    "text": "14.7 Ensemble Averaging and \\(1/N\\) Rule\nIn high dimensions, when we have a large number of predictive models that generate uncorrelated predictions, the optimal approach to generate a prediction is to average predictions from those individual models/weak predictors. This is called the \\(1/N\\) rule. The variance in the prediction is reduced by a factor of \\(N\\) when we average out \\(N\\) uncorrelated predictions. \\[\n\\mbox{Var} \\left ( \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\hat y_i \\right ) = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\mbox{Var} \\left ( \\hat y_i \\right ) + \\frac{2}{N^2} \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\mbox{Cov} \\left ( \\hat y_i, \\hat y_j \\right )\n\\] In high dimensions it is relatively easy to find uncorrelated predictors, and these techniques prove to lead to winning solutions in many machine learning competitions. The \\(1/N\\) rule is optimal due to exchangeability of the weak predictors, see Polson, Sokolov, et al. (2017)\n\n\nClassification variance decomposition\nThe famous result is due to Cover and Hart (1967) who proved that k-nearest neighbors are at most twice the bayes risk.\nAmit, Blanchard, and Wilder (2000) use the population conditional probability distribution of a point \\(X\\) given \\(Y=c\\), denoted by \\(P_{c}\\), and the associated conditional expectation and variance operators will be denoted \\(E_{c}\\) and \\(V a r_{c}\\). Define the vectors of average aggregates conditional on class \\(c\\) as \\[\nM_{c}(d)=E_{c}\\left[H_{\\mathbf{Q}}(X, d)\\right]=E\\left[H_{\\mathbf{Q}}(X, d) \\mid Y=c\\right]\n\\]\nfor \\(d=1, \\ldots, K\\). The average conditional margin (ACM) for class \\(c\\) is defined as\n\\[\n\\theta_{c}=\\min _{d \\neq c}\\left(M_{c}(c)-M_{c}(d)\\right)\n\\]\nWe assume that \\(\\theta_{c}&gt;0\\). This assumption is very weak since it involves only the average over the population of class \\(c\\). It is quite natural since one would not expect good classification results when it is violated. Indeed as shown below it is satisfied in all cases.\nGiven that \\(\\theta_{c}&gt;0\\), the error rate for class \\(c\\) depends on the extent to which the aggregate classifier \\(H_{\\mathbf{Q}}(X, d)\\) is concentrated around \\(M_{c}(d)\\) for each \\(d=1, \\ldots, K\\). The simplest measure of concentration is the variance of \\(H_{\\mathbf{Q}}(X, d)\\) with respect to the distribution \\(P_{c}\\). Using Chebyshev’s inequality we write a coarse bound on the misclassification probability with respect to \\(P_{c}\\) as follows.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nP_{c}\\left(C_{\\mathbf{Q}}(X) \\neq c\\right) \\leq & P_{c}\\left(H_{\\mathbf{Q}}(X, c)&lt;M_{c}(c)-\\theta_{c} / 2\\right) \\\\\n& +\\sum_{d \\neq c} P_{c}\\left(H_{\\mathbf{Q}}(X, d)&gt;M_{c}(d)+\\theta_{c} / 2\\right) \\\\\n\\leq & \\sum_{d=1}^{K} P_{c}\\left(\\left|H_{\\mathbf{Q}}(X, d)-M_{c}(d)\\right|&gt;\\theta_{c} / 2\\right) \\\\\n\\leq & \\frac{4}{\\theta_{c}^{2}} \\sum_{d=1}^{K} \\operatorname{Var}_{c}\\left[H_{\\mathbf{Q}}(X, d)\\right] . \\tag{10}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nOf course Chebyshev’s inequality is coarse and will not give very sharp results in itself, be we state it here as a landmark pointing to the relative importance of margin and variance, and to the tradeoff between the two quantities.\nWe rewrite each of the variance terms of the last equation as\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\operatorname{Var}_{c}\\left[E_{\\mathbf{Q}} h(X, d)\\right] & =E_{c}\\left[E_{\\mathbf{Q}} h(X, d)\\right]^{2}-\\left[E_{c} E_{\\mathbf{Q}} h(X, d)\\right]^{2} \\\\\n& =E_{\\mathbf{Q} \\otimes \\mathbf{Q}} E_{c}\\left[h_{1}(X, d) h_{2}(X, d)\\right]-E_{\\mathbf{Q} \\otimes \\mathbf{Q}}\\left[E_{c}\\left[h_{1}(X, d)\\right] E_{c}\\left[h_{2}(X, d)\\right]\\right] \\\\\n& =E_{\\mathbf{Q} \\otimes \\mathbf{Q}} \\operatorname{Cov}_{c}\\left[h_{1}(X, d), h_{2}(X, d)\\right] \\doteq \\gamma_{c, d} \\tag{11}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere the notation \\(E_{\\mathbf{Q} \\otimes \\mathbf{Q}}\\) means that \\(h_{1}, h_{2}\\) are two classifiers sampled independently from the distribution \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\). We can therefore interpret this variance term as the conditional covariance of two classifiers independently sampled from \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\). We call this quantity the average conditional covariance (ACC). Even if \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) is a discrete distribution, such as that provided by a particular run of \\(N\\) classifiers, when it is supported on a moderate number of classifiers, it is dominated by the conditional covariances of which there are order \\(N^{2}\\), and not the conditional variances of which there are order \\(N\\).\n\n\nConditional and unconditional dependence\nIt should be emphasized that two classifiers, provided that they achieve reasonable classification rate (that is, better than just picking a class at random) will not be unconditionally independent. If we do not know the class label of a point, and vector \\(\\left(h_{1}(X, i)\\right)_{i}\\) is large at class \\(c\\), then we actually change our expectations regarding \\(\\left(h_{2}(X, i)\\right)_{i}\\). On the other hand if we were given in advance the class label \\(Y\\), then knowing \\(h_{1}(X)\\) would hardly affect our guess about \\(h_{2}(X)\\). This is the motivation behind the notion of weak conditional dependence.\nThis is in contrast to the measure of dependence introduced in Dietterich (1998), which involves the unconditional covariance. The \\(\\kappa\\) statistic used there is\n\\[\n\\kappa\\left(h_{1}, h_{2}\\right)=\\frac{\\sum_{d} \\operatorname{Cov}\\left[h_{1}(X, d), h_{2}(X, d)\\right]}{1-\\sum_{d} E h_{1}(X, d) E h_{2}(X, d)},\n\\]\nA simple decomposition of the numerator yields: \\(\\operatorname{Cov}\\left[h_{1}(X, d), h_{2}(X, d)\\right]=E \\operatorname{Cov}\\left[h_{1}(X, d), h_{2}(X, d) \\mid Y\\right]+\\operatorname{Cov}\\left[E\\left[h_{1}(X, d) \\mid Y\\right], E\\left[h_{2}(X, d) \\mid Y\\right]\\right]\\).\n\n\n\n\nAmit, Yali, Gilles Blanchard, and Kenneth Wilder. 2000. “Multiple Randomized Classifiers: MRCL.”\n\n\nCover, T., and P.

    "text": "15.1 Structural time series models\nTime series data are everywhere, but time series modeling is a fairly specialized area within statistics and data science. This chapter describes the bsts software package, which makes it easy to fit some fairly sophisticated time series models with just a few lines of R code.\nThe BSTS (Bayesian Structural Time Series) section of this chapter is adapted from the excellent blog post by Steven Scott: “Fitting Bayesian structural time series with the bsts R package”. We thank Steven for making this material available and for his contributions to the time series community.\nTime series data are encountered across a wide range of fields, including business, the sciences, healthcare, and engineering. While forecasting future values (such as predicting next month’s sales) is a common application, time series analysis is also used to understand the factors that influence these values. Recently, time series forecasting has gained increased attention in the technology sector, with tools like Facebook’s “Prophet” (Sean J. Taylor and Ben Letham (2017)) and Google’s forecasting system (Eric Tassone and Farzan Rohani (2017)) being highlighted in various tech blogs.\nIn this chapter, we introduce the bsts package for R, which provides a framework for fitting Bayesian structural time series models. These models, also referred to as “state space models,” “structural time series,” “Kalman filter models,” or “dynamic linear models,” are highly flexible and can be approached from both Bayesian and non-Bayesian perspectives. The bsts package, however, is specifically designed to leverage Bayesian posterior sampling.\nAs an open-source package available on CRAN (installable via install.packages(\"bsts\")), bsts shares some similarities with the forecasting systems developed by Facebook and Google, but it was created with different objectives. Whereas the Facebook and Google tools are optimized for large-scale, automated forecasting—particularly for daily data and across many time series—bsts is intended to be more customizable. The focus of those large-scale systems is on automating analysis to handle many series efficiently, often by using techniques like regularized regression (Facebook) or ensemble averaging (Google), and by carefully accounting for holidays.\nWhile bsts can be set up for automated forecasting and is even used as part of Google’s ensemble approach, it is also well-suited for analysts who want to tailor models to specific needs. This includes decisions about forecasting horizons, handling of seasonality, and whether the primary goal is prediction or explanation.\nThe foundation of bsts is the structural time series model, which will be outlined in the next section. The chapter then proceeds with several detailed examples that showcase advanced features of the package. The first example, Nowcasting, covers local linear trend and seasonal models, as well as spike-and-slab priors for high-dimensional regression. The second example, Long-term forecasting, addresses cases where standard local level or trend models are insufficient and introduces the semilocal linear trend model. The third example, Recession modeling, demonstrates how to handle non-Gaussian response variables and focuses on controlling for serial dependence in explanatory modeling. The chapter concludes with a brief overview of additional features in bsts that are not covered in depth.\nA structural time series model is defined by two equations. The observation equation relates the observed data \\(y_t\\) to a vector of latent variables \\(\\alpha_t\\) known as the “state.” \\[\ny_t = Z_t^T\\alpha_t + \\epsilon_t.\n\\]\nThe transition equation describes how the latent state evolves through time. \\[\n\\alpha_{t+1} = T_t \\alpha_t + R_t \\eta_t.\n\\]\nThe error terms \\(\\epsilon_t\\) and \\(\\eta_t\\) are Gaussian and independent of everything else. The arrays \\(Z_t\\), \\(T_t\\) and \\(R_t\\) are structural parameters. They may contain parameters in the statistical sense, but often they simply contain strategically placed 0’s and 1’s indicating which bits of \\(\\alpha_t\\) are relevant for a particular computation. An example will hopefully make things clearer.\nThe simplest useful model is the “local level model,” in which the vector \\(\\alpha_t\\) is just a scalar \\(\\mu_t\\). The local level model is a random walk observed in noise. \\[\\begin{align*}\ny_t = &\\mu_t + \\epsilon_t\\\\\n\\mu_{t+1} = &\\mu_t + \\eta_t.\n\\end{align*}\\] Here \\(\\alpha_t=\\mu_t\\), and \\(Z_t\\), \\(T_t\\), and \\(R_t\\) all collapse to the scalar value 1. Similar to Bayesian hierarchical models for nested data, the local level model is a compromise between two extremes. The compromise is determined by variances of \\(\\epsilon_t \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\) and \\(\\eta_t \\sim N(0,\\tau^2)\\). If \\(\\tau^2=0\\) then \\(\\mu_t\\) is a constant, so the data are IID Gaussian noise. In that case the best estimator of \\(y_{t+1}\\) is the mean of \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_t\\). Conversely, if \\(\\sigma^2=0\\) then the data follow a random walk, in which case the best estimator of \\(y_{t+1}\\) is \\(y_t\\). Notice that in one case the estimator depends on all past data (weighted equally) while in the other it depends only on the most recent data point, giving past data zero weight. If both variances are positive then the optimal estimator of \\(y_{t+1}\\) winds up being “exponential smoothing,” where past data are forgotten at an exponential rate determined by the ratio of the two variances. Also notice that while the state in this model is Markov (i.e. it only depends on the previous state), the dependence among the observed data extends to the beginning of the series.\nFigure 15.1: Apple Adjusted Closing Price\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.2: Apple Adjusted Closing Price\nIn the example above, one of the plots shows the price of Apple stock from 2021-01-01 to 2022-12-31. The other plot is a sequence generated from a random walk model fitted to the Apple price data. Can you spot which one is which?\nStructural time series models are useful because they are flexible and modular. The analyst chooses the structure of \\(\\alpha_t\\) based on things like whether short- or long-term predictions are more important, whether the data contains seasonal effects, and whether and how regressors are to be included. Many of these models are standard, and can be fit using a variety of tools, such as the StructTS function distributed with base R or one of several R packages for fitting these models (with the dlm package (Petris (2010), Campagnoli, Petrone, and Petris (2009)) deserving special mention). The bsts package handles all the standard cases, but it also includes several useful extensions, described in the next few sections through a series of examples. Each example includes a mathematical description of the model and example bsts code showing how to work with the model using the bsts software. To keep things short, details about prior assumptions are largely avoided.",

    "text": "Example 15.1 (Nowcasting) S. Scott and Varian (2014) and Steven L. Scott and Varian (2015) used structural time series models to show how Google search data can be used to improve short-term forecasts (“nowcasts”) of economic time series. The figure below shows the motivating data set from S. Scott and Varian (2014), which is also included with the bsts package. The data consist of the weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance in the US, as reported by the US Federal Reserve. Like many official statistics, they are released with delay and subject to revision. At the end of the week, the economic activity determining these numbers has taken place, but the official numbers are not published until several days later. For economic decisions based on these and similar numbers, it would help to have an early forecast of the current week’s number as of the close of the week. Thus the output of this analysis is truly a “nowcast” of data that has already happened rather than a “forecast” of data that will happen in the future.\n\nlibrary(bsts)     # load the bsts package\ndata(iclaims)     # bring the initial.claims data into scope\nplot(initial.claims$iclaimsNSA, lwd=2, ylab=\"Unemployment claims (thousand)\", col=\"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.3: Weekly initial claims for unemployment in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two sources of information about the current value \\(y_t\\) in the initial claims series: past values \\(y_{t-\\tau}\\) describing the time series behavior of the series, and contemporaneous predictors \\(x_t\\) from a data source which is correlated with \\(y_t\\), but which is available without the delay exhibited by \\(y_t\\). The time series structure shows an obvious trend (in which the financial and housing crises in 2008 - 2009 are apparent) as well as a strong annual seasonal pattern. The external data source explored by Scott and Varian was search data from Google trends with search queries such as “how to file for unemployment” having obvious relevance.\nScott and Varian modeled the data using a structural time series with three state components:\n\ntrend \\(\\mu_t\\)\nseasonal pattern \\(\\tau_t\\)\n\nregression component \\(\\beta^Tx_t\\).\n\nThe model is \\[\\begin{align*}\ny_t = & \\mu_t + \\tau_t + \\beta^T x_t + \\epsilon_t\\\\\n\\mu_{t+1} = &\\mu_t + \\delta_t + \\eta_{0t}\\\\\n\\delta_{t+1} = &\\delta_t + \\eta_{1t}\\\\\n\\tau_{t+1} = &-\\sum_{s = 1}^{S-1}\\tau_{t} + \\eta_{2t}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe trend component looks similar to the local level model above, but it has an extra term \\(\\delta_t\\). Notice that \\(\\delta_t\\) is the amount of extra \\(\\mu\\) you can expect as \\(t\\rightarrow t+1\\), so it can be interpreted as the slope of the local linear trend. Slopes normally multiply some \\(x\\) variable, but in this case \\(x=\\Delta t\\), which is omitted from the equation because it is always 1. The slope evolves according to a random walk, which makes the trend an integrated random walk with an extra drift term. The local linear trend is a better model than the local level model if you think the time series is trending in a particular direction and you want future forecasts to reflect a continued increase (or decrease) seen in recent observations. Whereas the local level model bases forecasts around the average value of recent observations, the local linear trend model adds in recent upward or downward slopes as well. As with most statistical models, the extra flexibility comes at the price of extra volatility.\nThe best way to understand the seasonal component \\(\\tau_t\\) is in terms of a regression with seasonal dummy variables. Suppose you had quarterly data, so that \\(S=4\\). You might include the annual seasonal cycle using 3 dummy variables, with one left out as a baseline. Alternatively, you could include all four dummy variables but constrain their coefficients to sum to zero. The seasonal state model takes the latter approach, but the constraint is that the \\(S\\) most recent seasonal effects must sum to zero in expectation. This allows the seasonal pattern to slowly evolve. Scott and Varian described the annual cycle in the weekly initial claims data using a seasonal state component with \\(S=52\\). Of course weeks don’t neatly divide years, but given the small number of years for which Google data are available the occasional one-period seasonal discontinuity was deemed unimportant.\nLet’s ignore the regression component for now and fit a bsts model with just the trend and seasonal components.\n\nss &lt;- AddLocalLinearTrend(list(), initial.claims$iclaimsNSA)\nss &lt;- AddSeasonal(ss, initial.claims$iclaimsNSA, nseasons = 52)\nmodel1 &lt;- bsts(initial.claims$iclaimsNSA,state.specification = ss,niter = 1000)\n\nThe first thing to do when fitting a bsts model is to specify the contents of the latent state vector \\(\\alpha_t\\). The bsts package offers a library of state models, which are included by adding them to a state specification (which is just a list with a particular format). The call to AddLocalLinearTrend above adds a local linear trend state component to an empty state specification (the list() in its first argument). The call to AddSeasonal adds a seasonal state component with 52 seasons to the state specification created on the previous line. The state vector \\(\\alpha_t\\) is formed by concatenating the state from each state model. Similarly, the vector \\(Z_t\\) is formed by concatenating the \\(Z\\) vectors from the two state models, while the matrices \\(T_t\\) and \\(R_t\\) are combined in block-diagonal fashion.\nThe state specification is passed as an argument to bsts, along with the data and the desired number of MCMC iterations. The model is fit using an MCMC algorithm, which in this example takes about 20 seconds to produce 1000 MCMC iterations. The returned object is a list (with class attribute bsts). You can see its contents by typing\n\nnames(model1)\n\n##  [1] \"sigma.obs\"                  \"sigma.trend.level\"         \n##  [3] \"sigma.trend.slope\"          \"sigma.seasonal.52\"         \n##  [5] \"final.state\"                \"state.contributions\"       \n##  [7] \"one.step.prediction.errors\" \"log.likelihood\"            \n##  [9] \"has.regression\"             \"state.specification\"       \n## [11] \"prior\"                      \"timestamp.info\"            \n## [13] \"model.options\"              \"family\"                    \n## [15] \"niter\"                      \"original.series\"\n\n\nThe first few elements contain the MCMC draws of the model parameters. Most of the other elements are data structures needed by various S3 methods (plot, print, predict, etc.) that can be used with the returned object. MCMC output is stored in vectors (for scalar parameters) or arrays (for vector or matrix parameters) where the first index in the array corresponds to MCMC iteration number, and the remaining indices correspond to dimension of the deviate being drawn.\nMost users won’t need to look inside the returned bsts object because standard tasks like plotting and prediction are available through familiar S3 methods. For example, there are several plot methods available.\n\npar(mar=c(4,4,2,0))\nplot(model1,col.actuals=\"blue\", col.predictions=\"red\")\nplot(model1, \"components\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Prediction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Components\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.4: Structural time series model for unemployment claims\n\n\n\n\nThe Figure 15.4 (a) above shows the posterior distribution of model state. Blue circles are actual data points. The Figure 15.4 (b) shows the individual state components. The plot looks fuzzy because it is showing the marginal posterior distribution at each time point.\nThe default plot method plots the posterior distribution of the conditional mean \\(Z_t^T\\alpha_t\\) given the full data \\(y=y_1,\\ldots,y_T\\). Other plot methods can be accessed by passing a string to the plot function. For example, to see the contributions of the individual state components, pass the string “components” as a second argument, as shown above. The figure below shows the output of these two plotting functions. You can get a list of all available plots by passing the string help as the second argument.\nTo predict future values there is a predict method. For example, to predict the next 12 time points you would use the following commands.\n\npar(mar=c(4,4,0,0))\npred1 &lt;- predict(model1, horizon = 12)\nplot(pred1, plot.original = 156)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output of predict is an object of class bsts.prediction, which has its own plot method. The plot.original = 156 argument says to plot the prediction along with the last 156 time points (3 years) of the original series.",

When faced with large numbers of potential predictors it is important to have a prior distribution that induces sparsity. A spike and slab prior is a natural way to express a prior belief that most of the regression coefficients are exactly zero.\nA spike and slab prior is a prior on a set of regression coefficients that assigns each coefficient a positive probability of being zero. Upon observing data, Bayes’ theorem updates the inclusion probability of each coefficient. When sampling from the posterior distribution of a regression model under a spike and slab prior, many of the simulated regression coefficients will be exactly zero. This is unlike the “lasso” prior (the Laplace, or double-exponential distribution), which yields MAP estimates at zero but where posterior simulations will be all nonzero. You can read about the mathematical details of spike and slab priors in S. Scott and Varian (2014).\nWhen fitting bsts models that contain a regression component, extra arguments captured by ... are passed to the SpikeSlabPrior function from the BoomSpikeSlab package. This allows the analyst to adjust the default prior settings for the regression component from the bsts function call. To include a regression component in a bsts model, simply pass a model formula as the first argument.\n\n# Fit a `bsts` model with expected model size 1, the default.\nmodel2 &lt;- bsts(iclaimsNSA ~ .,state.specification = ss,niter = 1000,data = initial.claims)\n# Fit a `bsts` model with expected model size 5, to include more coefficients.\nmodel3 &lt;- bsts(iclaimsNSA ~ .,state.specification = ss,niter = 1000,data = initial.claims,expected.model.size = 5)  # Passed to SpikeSlabPrior.\n\nTo examine the output you can use the same plotting functions as before. For example, to see the contribution of each state component you can type\n\npar(mar=c(4,4,3,0))\nplot(model2, \"comp\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt produces the contribution of each state component to the initial claims data, assuming a regression component with default prior. Compare to the previous model. The regression component is explaining a substantial amount of variation in the initial claims series.\nThere are also plotting functions that you can use to visualize the regression coefficients. The following commands plot posterior inclusion probabilities for predictors in the “initial claims” nowcasting example assuming an expected model size of 1 and 5.\npar(mar=c(4,0,0,0))\nplot(model2, \"coef\")\nplot(model3, \"coef\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Full\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Sparse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.5: Variable Importance\n\n\n\nThe search term “unemployment office” shows up with high probability in both models. Increasing the expected model size from 1 (the default) to 5 allows other variables into the model, though “Idaho unemployment” is the only one that shows up with high probability.\nThose probabilities are calculated from the histogram of the samples of each \\(\\beta\\) calculated by the estimation algorithm (MCMC)\npar(mar=c(4,4,0,0))\n# unemployment.office\nhist(model3$coefficients[,10], breaks = 40, main=\"\",xlab=\"unemployment.office\", col=\"lightblue\")\n# pennsylvania.unemployment\nhist(model3$coefficients[,3], breaks = 40, main = \"\", xlab=\"pennsylvania.unemployment\", col=\"lightblue\")\nhist(model2$coefficients[,3], breaks = 40, main = \"\", xlab=\"pennsylvania.unemployment\", col=\"lightblue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Sparse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Sparse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Full\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.6: Sample from the distribution over two beta parameters",

    "text": "15.3 Model diagnostics: did the Google data help?\nAs part of the model fitting process, the algorithm generates the one-step-ahead prediction errors \\(y_t - E(y_t | Y_{t-1}, \\theta)\\), where \\(Y_{t-1}=y_1,\\ldots,y_{t-1}\\), and the vector of model parameters \\(\\theta\\) is fixed at its current value in the MCMC algorithm. The one-step-ahead prediction errors can be obtained from the bsts model by calling bsts.prediction.errors(model1).\nThe one step prediction errors are a useful diagnostic for comparing several bsts models that have been fit to the same data. They are used to implement the function CompareBstsModels, which is called as shown below.\n\nCompareBstsModels(list(\"Model 1\" = model1,\n               \"Model 2\" = model2,\n               \"Model 3\" = model3),\n          colors = c(\"black\", \"red\", \"blue\"))\n\n\n\n\nComparison of Errors for the three models.\n\n\n\n\nThe bottom panel shows the original series. The top panel shows the cumulative total of the mean absolute one step prediction errors for each model. The final time point in the top plot is proportional to the mean absolute prediction error for each model, but plotting the errors as a cumulative total lets you see particular spots where each model encountered trouble, rather than just giving a single number describing each model’s predictive accuracy. This figure shows that the Google data help explain the large spike near 2009, where model 1 accumulates errors at an accelerated rate, but models 2 and 3 continue accumulating errors at about the same rate they had been before. The fact that the lines for models 2 and 3 overlap in this figure means that the additional predictors allowed by the relaxed prior used to fit model 3 do not yield additional predictive accuracy.\n\nExample 15.2 (Long-term forecasting) A common question about bsts is “which trend model should I use?” To answer that question it helps to know a bit about the different models that the bsts software package provides, and what each model implies. In the local level model, the state evolves according to a random walk: \\[\n\\mu_{t+1}=\\mu_t+\\eta_t.\n\\] If you place your eye at time 0 and ask what happens at time \\(t\\), you find that \\(\\mu_t \\sim N(\\mu_0,t\\sigma^2_\\eta)\\). The variance continues to grow with \\(t\\), all the way to \\(t=\\infty\\). The local linear trend is even more volatile. When forecasting far into the future, the flexibility provided by these models becomes a double-edged sword, as local flexibility in the near term translates into extreme variance in the long term.\nAn alternative is to replace the random walk with a stationary AR process. For example \\[\n\\mu_{t+1}=\\rho\\mu_t+\\eta_t,\n\\]\nwith \\(\\eta_t \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2_{\\eta})\\) and \\(|\\rho|&lt;1\\). This model has stationary distribution \\[\n\\mu_{\\infty} \\sim N\\left(0,\\frac{\\sigma^2_{\\eta}}{1-\\rho^2}\\right),\n\\] which means that uncertainty grows to a finite asymptote, rather than infinity, in the distant future. The bsts package offers autoregressive state models through the functions AddAr, when you want to specify a certain number of lags, and AddAutoAr when you want the software to choose the important lags for you.\nA hybrid model modifies the local linear trend model by replacing the random walk on the slope with a stationary AR(1) process, while keeping the random walk for the level of the process. The bsts package refers to this is the “semilocal linear trend” model. \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mu_{t+1}=&    \\mu_t+\\delta_t+\\eta_{0t}\\\\\n\\delta_{t+1}=& D+\\rho(\\delta_t-D)+\\eta_{1t}\n\\end{align*}\\] The \\(D\\) parameter is the long-run slope of the trend component, to which \\(\\delta_t\\) will eventually revert. However, \\(\\delta_t\\) can have short-term autoregressive deviations from the long-term trend, with memory determined by \\(\\rho\\). Values of \\(\\rho\\) close to 1 will lead to long deviations from \\(D\\). To see the impact this can have on long-term forecasts, consider the time series of daily closing values for the S&P 500 stock market index over the last 5 years, shown below.\n\nGSPC = read.csv(\"../data/GSPC.csv\")\nGSPC = xts(GSPC, order.by = as.Date(rownames(GSPC), \"%Y-%m-%d\"))\nknitr::kable(head(GSPC))\nplot(GSPC$GSPC.Adjusted, main=\"\")\n\n\n\n\nDaily closing values for the S&P 500 stock market index\n\n\n\n\nConsider two forecasts of the daily values of this series for the next 360 days. The first assumes the local linear trend model. The second assumes the semilocal linear trend.\n\nsp500 = GSPC$GSPC.Adjusted\nss1 &lt;- AddLocalLinearTrend(list(), sp500)\nmodel1 &lt;- bsts(sp500, state.specification = ss1, niter = 1000)\nss2 &lt;- AddSemilocalLinearTrend(list(), sp500)\nmodel2 &lt;- bsts(sp500, state.specification = ss2, niter = 1000)\n\nThe figure below shows long-term forecasts of the S&P 500 closing values under the (left) local linear trend and (right) semilocal linear trend state models.\nload(\"../data/timeseries/model12-sp500.RData\")\npar(mar=c(4,4,0,1))\npred1 &lt;- predict(model1, horizon = 360)\npred2 &lt;- predict(model2, horizon = 360)\nplot(pred2, plot.original = 360, ylim = range(pred1))\nplot(pred1, plot.original = 360, ylim = range(pred1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Semi-local trend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Local trend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.7: S&P 500 Prediction\n\n\n\nNot only are the forecast expectations from the two models different, but the forecast errors from the local linear trend model are implausibly wide, including a small but nonzero probability that the S&P 500 index could close near zero in the next 360 days. The error bars from the semilocal linear trend model are far more plausible, and more closely match the uncertainty observed over the life of the series thus far.\n\n\nExample 15.3 (Recession modeling using non-Gaussian data) Although we have largely skipped details about how the bsts software fits models, the Gaussian error assumptions in the observation and transition equations are important for the model fitting process. Part of that process involves running data through the Kalman filter, which assumes Gaussian errors in both the state and transition equations. In many settings where Gaussian errors are obviously inappropriate, such as for binary or small count data, one can introduce latent variables that give the model a conditionally Gaussian representation. Well known “data augmentation” methods exist for probit regression (Albert (1993)) and models with student-T errors (Rubin (2015)). Somewhat more complex methods exist for logistic regression (Frühwirth-Schnatter and Frühwirth (2007), Held and Holmes (2006), Gramacy and Polson (2012)) and Poisson regression (Frühwirth-Schnatter et al. (2008)). Additional methods exist for quantile regression (Benoit and Van den Poel (2012)), support vector machines (Polson and Scott (2011)), and multinomial logit regression (Frühwirth-Schnatter and Frühwirth (2010)). These are not currently provided by the bsts package, but they might be added in the future.\nTo see how non-Gaussian errors can be useful, consider the analysis done by Berge, Sinha, and Smolyansky (2016), who used Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to investigate which of several economic indicators would best predict the presence or absence of a recession. We will focus on their nowcasting example, which models the probability of a recession at the same time point as the predictor variables. Berge, Sinha, and Smolyansky (2016) also analyzed the data with the predictors at several lags.\nThe model used in Berge, Sinha, and Smolyansky (2016) was a probit regression, with Bayesian model averaging used to determine which predictors should be included. The response variable was the presence or absence of a recession (as determined by NBER).\n\ndat &lt;- read.csv(\"../data/timeseries/rec_data_20160613.csv\")\nrec = ts(dat$nber, start=c(1973, 1), end=c(2016, 5), frequency=12)\nplot(rec, type='l', col='blue', ylab=\"Recession\")\n\n\n\n\nRecession periods identified by NBER\n\n\n\n\nThe BMA done by Berge, Sinha, and Smolyansky (2016) is essentially the same as fitting a logistic regression under a spike-and-slab prior with the prior inclusion probability of each predictor set to 1/2. That analysis can be run using the BoomSpikeSlab R package (Steven L. Scott (2022)), which is similar to bsts, but with only a regression component and no time series.\nThe logistic regression model is highly predictive, but it ignores serial dependence in the data. To capture serial dependence, consider the following dynamic logistic regression model with a local level trend model. \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathrm{logit}(p_t)= &  \\mu_t+\\beta^Tx_t\\\\\n\\mu_{t+1}= &            \\mu_t+\\eta_t\n\\end{align*}\\] Here \\(p_t\\) is the probability of a recession at time \\(t\\) ,and \\(x_t\\) is the set of economic indicators used by Berge, Sinha, and Smolyansky (2016) in their analysis.

This effect captures the strong serial dependence in the recession data. Recessions are rare, but once they occur they tend to persist. Assuming independent time points is therefore unrealistic, and it substantially overstates the amount of information available to identify logistic regression coefficients.",

    "section": "15.4 Final Remarks on Structural Models",
    "text": "15.4 Final Remarks on Structural Models\nThe preceding examples have shown that the bsts software package can handle several nonstandard, but useful, time series applications. These include the ability to handle large numbers of contemporaneous predictors with spike and slab priors, the presence of trend models suitable for long term forecasting, and the ability to handle non-Gaussian data. We have run out of space, but bsts can do much more.\nFor starters, there are other state models you can use. Bsts has elementary support for holidays. It knows about 18 US holidays, and has capacity to add more, including holidays that occur on the same date each year, holidays that occur on a fixed weekday of a fixed month (e.g. 3rd Tuesday in February, or last Monday in November). The model for each holiday is a simple random walk, but look for future versions to have improved holiday support via Bayesian shrinkage.\nBsts offers support for multiple seasonalities. For example, if you have several weeks of hourly data then you will have an hour-of-day effect as well as a day-of-week effect. You can model these using a single seasonal effect with 168 seasons (which would allow for different hourly effects on weekends and weekdays), or you can assume additive seasonal patterns using the season.duration argument to AddSeasonal,\nss &lt;- AddSeasonal(ss, y, nseasons = 24)\nss &lt;- AddSeasonal(ss, y, nseasons = 7, season.duration = 24)\nThe latter specifies that each daily effect should remain constant for 24 hours. For modeling physical phenomena, bsts also offers trigonometric seasonal effects, which are sine and cosine waves with time varying coefficients. You obtain these by calling AddTrig. Time varying effects are available for arbitrary regressions with small numbers of predictor variables through a call to AddDynamicRegression.\nIn addition to the trend models discussed so far, the function AddStudentLocalLinearTrend gives a version of the local linear trend model that assumes student-t errors instead of Gaussian errors. This is a useful state model for short term predictions when the mean of the time series exhibits occasional dramatic jumps. Student-t errors can be introduced into the observation equation by passing the family = \"student\" argument to the bsts function call. Allowing for heavy tailed errors in the observation equation makes the model robust against individual outliers, while heavy tails in the state model provides robustness against sudden persistent shifts in level or slope. This can lead to tighter prediction limits than Gaussian models when modeling data that have been polluted by outliers. The observation equation can also be set to a Poisson model for small count data if desired.\nFinally, the most recent update to bsts supports data with multiple observations at each time stamp. The Gaussian version of the model is \\[\\begin{align*}\ny_{it} = &\\beta^T x_{it} + Z_t^T\\alpha_t + \\epsilon_{it}\\\\\n\\alpha_{t+1} = & T_t \\alpha_t + R_t \\eta_t,\n\\end{align*}\\] which is best understood as a regression model with a time varying intercept.",

    "text": "15.5 Algorithms\nThe classic filtering and prediction algorithms for linear and Gaussian systems are described in Rudolph Emil Kalman (1960) and R. E. Kalman and Bucy (1961). Early work on discrete recursions for hidden Markov models are in Baum et al. (1970) who use an EM-type algorithm, Viterbi (1967) who provides a modal state filter estimate and recursions developed in Lindgren (1978). While these can be used to evaluate the marginal likelihood for the parameters they are computationally too intensive to solve the filtering and learning, Lindgren (1978). Steven L. Scott (2002) provides a review of FFBS algorithms for discrete HMMs.\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for parameter learning in nonlinear non-Gaussian state space models were developed by Carlin, Polson, and Stoffer (1992). For linear and Gaussian systems, Carter and Kohn (1994) introduced the filter forward and backwards sample (FFBS) algorithm, which efficiently draws the entire block of hidden states. For handling multinomial logit models, Steven L. Scott (2002) and Frühwirth-Schnatter et al. (2008) developed mixture of normals approximation methods. Additionally, West and Harrison (1997) proposed conditionally conjugate priors that allow parameters to be marginalized out of the updating equations, leading to more efficient inference procedures.\n\nKalman Filtering\nThe Normal/ Normal Bayesian learning model provides the basis for shrinkage estimation of multiple means and the basis of the Kalman filter for dynamically tracking a path of an object.\nThe Kalman filter is arguably the most common application of Bayesian inference. The Kalman filter assumes a linear and Gaussian state-space model: \\[\ny_{t}=x_{t}+\\sigma\\varepsilon_{t}^{y}\\text{ and }x_{t}=x_{t-1}+\\sigma\n_{x}\\varepsilon_{t}^{x},\n\\] where \\(\\varepsilon_{t}^{y}\\) and \\(\\varepsilon_{t}^{x}\\) are i.i.d. standard normal and \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(\\sigma_{x}\\) are known. The observation equation posits that the observed data, \\(y_{t}\\), consists of the random-walk latent state, \\(x_{t}\\), that is polluted by noise, \\(\\sigma\\varepsilon_{t}^{y}\\). Further, \\(\\sigma_{x}/\\sigma\\) is the “signal-to-noise” ratio, measures the information content of the signal. As \\(\\sigma\\) increases relatively to \\(\\sigma_{x}\\), the observations become noisier and less informative. The model is initialized via a prior distribution over \\(x_{0}\\), which is for analytical tractability must be normally distributed, \\(x_{0}\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left( \\mu_{0},\\sigma_{0}^{2}\\right)\\).\nThe posterior distribution solves the filtering problem and is defined recursively via Bayes rule: \\[\np\\left(  x_{t+1} \\mid y^{t+1}\\right)  =\\frac{p\\left(  y_{t+1} \\mid x_{t+1}\\right)\np\\left(  x_{t+1} \\mid y^{t}\\right)  }{p\\left(  y_{t+1} \\mid y^{t}\\right)  }\\propto\np\\left(  y_{t+1} \\mid x_{t+1}\\right)  p\\left(  x_{t+1} \\mid y^{t}\\right)  \\text{.}%\n\\] and the likelihood function, \\(p\\left( y_{t+1} \\mid x_{t+1}\\right)\\). The predictive distribution summarizes all of the information about \\(x_{t+1}\\) based on lagged observations. The likelihood function summarizes the new information in \\(y_{t+1}\\) about \\(x_{t+1}\\).\nThe Kalman filter relies on an inductive argument: assume that \\(p\\left( x_{t} \\mid y^{t}\\right) \\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left( \\mu_{t},\\sigma_{t}^{2}\\right)\\) and then verify that \\(p\\left( x_{t+1} \\mid y^{t+1}\\right) \\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left( \\mu_{t+1},\\sigma_{t+1}^{2}\\right)\\) with analytical expressions for the hyperparameters. To verify, note that since \\(p\\left(x_{t} \\mid y^{t}\\right) \\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left( \\mu_{t},\\sigma_{t}^{2}\\right)\\), \\(x_{t}=\\mu_{t}+\\sigma_{t}\\eta_{t}\\) for some standard normal \\(\\eta_{t}\\). Substituting into the state evolution, the predictive is \\(x_{t+1} \\mid y^{t}\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left( \\mu_{t},\\sigma_{t}^{2}+\\sigma_{x}^{2}\\right)\\). Since \\(p\\left( y_{t+1} \\mid x_{t+1}\\right) \\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(x_{t+1},\\sigma^{2}\\right)\\), the posterior is \\[\\begin{align*}\np\\left(  x_{t+1} \\mid y^{t+1}\\right)   &  \\propto p\\left(  y_{t+1} \\mid x_{t+1}\\right)\np\\left(  x_{t+1} \\mid y^{t}\\right)  \\propto\\exp\\left[  -\\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{\\left(  y_{t+1}-x_{t+1}\\right)  ^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}}+\\frac{\\left( x_{t+1}-\\mu_{t}\\right)  ^{2}}{\\sigma_{t}^{2}+\\sigma_{x}^{2}}\\right)  \\right]\n\\\\\n&  \\propto\\exp\\left(  -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\left(  x_{t+1}-\\mu_{t+1}\\right)\n^{2}}{\\sigma_{t+1}^{2}}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\mu_{t+1}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{t+1}^{2}\\) are computed by completing the square: \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{\\mu_{t+1}}{\\sigma_{t+1}^{2}}=\\frac{y_{t+1}}{\\sigma^{2}}+\\frac{\\mu_{t}%\n}{\\sigma_{t}^{2}+\\sigma_{x}^{2}}\\text{ and }\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{t+1}^{2}}%\n=\\frac{1}{\\sigma^{2}}+\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{t}^{2}+\\sigma_{x}^{2}}\\text{.}\\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\\] Here, inference on \\(x_{t}\\) is merely running the Kalman filter, that is, sequential computing \\(\\mu_{t}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{t}^{2}\\), which are state sufficient statistics.\nThe Kalman filter provides an excellent example of the mechanics of Bayesian inference: given a prior and likelihood, compute the posterior distribution. In this setting, it is hard to imagine an more intuitive or alternative approach. The same approach applied to learning fixed static parameters. In this case, \\(y_{t}=\\mu+\\sigma\\varepsilon_{t},\\) where \\(\\mu\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left( \\mu_{0},\\sigma_{0}^{2}\\right)\\) is the initial distribution. Using the same arguments as above, it is easy to show that \\(p\\left(\\mu \\mid y^{t+1}\\right) \\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left( \\mu_{t+1},\\sigma_{t+1}^{2}\\right)\\), where \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\mu_{t+1}}{\\sigma_{t+1}^{2}}  &  =\\left(  \\frac{y_{t+1}}{\\sigma^{2}}+\\frac{\\mu_{t}}{\\sigma_{t}^{2}}\\right)  =\\frac{\\left(  t+1\\right) \\overline{y}_{t+1}}{\\sigma^{2}}+\\frac{\\mu_{0}}{\\sigma_{0}^{2}}\\text{,}\\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{t+1}^{2}}  &  =\\frac{1}{\\sigma^{2}}+\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{t}^{2}}=\\frac{\\left(  t+1\\right)  }{\\sigma^{2}}+\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{0}^{2}}\\text{,}\n\\end{align*}\\] and \\(\\overline{y}_{t}=t^{-1}\\sum_{t=1}^{t}y_{t}\\).\nNow, given this example, the same statements can be posed as in the state variable learning problem: it is hard to think of a more intuitive or alternative approach for sequential learning. In this case, researchers often have different feelings about assuming a prior distribution over the state variable and a parameter. In the state filtering problem, it is difficult to separate the prior distribution and the likelihood. In fact, one could view the initial distribution over \\(x_{0}\\), the linear evolution for the state variable, and the Gaussian errors as the “prior” distribution.\nNow consider,linear multivariate Gaussian state space model: \\[\\begin{align*}\ny_{t} &  =F_{t}x_{t}+\\varepsilon_{t} \\; \\; \\text{where} \\; \\; \\varepsilon_{t}\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left( 0,\\Sigma_{t}\\right) \\\\\nx_{t} &  =G_{t}x_{t-1}+\\varepsilon_{t}^{x} \\; \\; \\text{where} \\; \\; \\varepsilon_{t}^x\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left( 0,\\Sigma_{t}^x\\right)\n\\end{align*}\\] where we allow for heteroscedascity in the error variance-covariance matrices. We complete the model specification with a normal prior on the initial starting condition \\(x_{0}\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(  \\mu_{0},\\Sigma_{0}\\right)\\). It is important to recognize that \\(\\varepsilon_{t}\\) and \\(\\varepsilon_{t}^{x}\\) need only be conditionally normal. There are a number of distributions of interest \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Filtering}  &  :p\\left(  x_{t}|y^{t}\\right)  \\text{ }t=1,...,T\\\\\n\\text{Forecasting}  &  :p\\left(  x_{t+1}|y^{t}\\right)  \\text{ } t=1,...,T\\\\\n\\text{Smoothing}  &  :p\\left(  x_{t}|y^{t+1}\\right)  \\text{ }t=1,...,T \\\\\n\\text{Prediction}  &  :p\\left(  y_{t+1}|y^{t}\\right)  \\text{ }t=1,...,T\n\\end{align*}\\] For known parameters with linearity and Gaussianity we have the following Kalman filter recursions for calculation these distributions.\nThe fundamental filtering relationship is based on the fact that the filtering distribution is of the form \\[\np(x_{t}|y^{t})\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(  \\mu_{t|t},\\Sigma_{t|t}\\right)\n\\;\\;\\mathrm{and}\\;\\;p(x_{t+1}|y^{t+1})\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(  \\mu\n_{t+1|t+1},\\Sigma_{t+1|t+1}\\right)\n\\] where \\((\\mu_{t+1|t+1},\\Sigma_{t+1|t+1})\\) are related to \\((\\mu_{t|t}%\n,\\Sigma_{t|t})\\) via the Kalman filter recursions. In the following, it is sometimes useful to write this as \\[\np(x_{t}|y^{t})\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(  \\mu_{t|t},\\Sigma_{t|t}\\right) \\; \\Rightarrow \\; x_{t}=\\mu_{t|t}+\\Sigma_{t|t}^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\widehat{\\varepsilon}_{t}%\n\\] where \\(\\widehat{\\varepsilon}_{t} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\). Before we derive the filtering recursions and characterize the state filtering distribution we first find the forecasting distribution. The predictive or forecast distribution is defined as follows.\nPredictive Distribution, \\(p( x_{t+1} | y^{t} )\\).\nThe key distributions in Bayes rule are the predictive and the conditional state posterior given by \\[\np( x_{t+1}|y^{t} )\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(  \\mu_{t+1|t},\\Sigma_{t+1|t}\\right)\n\\] To compute the predictive or forecasting distribution note that:\n\\[\np\\left(  x_{t+1}|y^{t}\\right)  =p\\left(  G_{t+1}x_{t}+\\varepsilon_{t+1}%\n^{x}|y^{t}\\right)  \\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(  \\mu_{t+1|t},\\Sigma_{t+1|t} \\right)\n\\] where the predictive moments are\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mu_{t+1|t}  &  =G_{t+1}\\mu_{t}\\\\\n\\Sigma_{t+1|t}  &  =G_{t+1}\\Sigma_{t}G_{t+1}^T+\\Sigma_{t+1}^{x}.\n\\end{align*}\\] We now state and derive the main Kalman filtering recursions for linear Gaussian models with known parameters.\nFiltering Distribution The classic Kalman filter characterisation of the state filtering distributionp(x_{t+1}|y^{t+1})$ and moment recursions are given by \\[\np(x_{t+1}|y^{t+1})\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(  \\mu_{t+1|t+1},\\Sigma_{t+1|t+1}\\right)\n\\] The updated posterior means and variances are defined by \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mu_{t+1|t+1} &  =\\mu_{t+1|t}+K_{t+1}e_{t+1}\\\\\n\\Sigma_{t+1|t+1} &  =(I-K_{t+1}F_{t+1})\\Sigma_{t+1|t}%\n\\end{align*}\\] where the Kalman gain \\(K_{t+1}\\) matrix and innovations vector \\(e_{t+1}\\) are \\[\\begin{align*}\nK_{t+1}  &  = \\Sigma_{t+1|t} F_{t+1}^T\\left(  F_{t+1} \\Sigma_{t+1|t}\nF_{t+1}^T+ \\Sigma_{t+1} \\right)  ^{-1}\\\\\ne_{t+1}  &  = y_{t+1} - F_{t+1} \\mu_{t+1|t}%\n\\end{align*}\\]\nTo prove this result we use the predictive distribution and an application of Bayes rule which implies that\n\\[\\begin{align*}\np\\left(  x_{t+1}|y^{t+1}\\right)   & = p\\left(  x_{t+1}|y_{t+1}%\n,y^{t}\\right) \\\\\n&  = \\frac{ p\\left(  y_{t+1}|x_{t+1}\\right)  p\\left(  x_{t+1}|y^{t}\\right)}{  p\\left(  y_{t+1}|y^t\\right) }\n\\text{.}%\n\\end{align*}\\] Under the normality assumption, the likelihood term is \\[\np( y_{t+1} | x_{t+1} ) = ( 2 \\pi )^{-\\frac{p}{2}} | \\Sigma_{t+1} |^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n  \\exp \\left ( - \\frac{1}{2} ( y_{t+1} - F_{t+1} x_{t+1} )^T\\Sigma_{t+1}^{-1} ( y_{t+1} - F_{t+1}\nx_{t+1} ) \\right )\n\\] Combining with the exponent term from the state predicitive distribution, then gives an exponent for the filtering distribution of the form \\[\n( y_{t+1} - F_{t+1} x_{t+1} )^T\\Sigma_{t+1}^{-1} ( y_{t+1} - F_{t+1}\nx_{t+1} ) +( x_{t+1} - \\mu_{t+1|t} )^T\\Sigma_{t+1|t}^{-1} ( x_{t+1} -\n\\mu_{t+1|t} )\n\\] Now we define the de-meaned state and innovations vectors,\n\\[\n\\tilde{x}_{t+1} = x_{t+1} - \\mu_{t+1|t} \\; \\text{and} \\; e_{t+1} = y_{t+1} - F_{t+1} \\mu_{t+1|t}\n\\] Using the usual completing the square trick we can re-write the exponent as \\[\n( e_{t+1} - F_{t+1} \\tilde{x}_{t+1} )^T\\Sigma_{t+1}^{-1} ( e_{t+1} -\nF_{t+1} \\tilde{x}_{t+1} ) + \\tilde{x}_{t+1}^T\\Sigma_{t+1|t}^{-1}\n\\tilde{x}_{t+1}\n\\] The sums of squares can be decomposed further as \\[\n\\tilde{x}_{t+1}^T\\left(  F_{t+1}^T\\Sigma_{t+1}^T+\n\\Sigma_{t+1|t}^{-1} \\right)  \\tilde{x}_{t+1} + 2 \\tilde{x}_{t+1}^T\\left(  F_{t+1}^T\\Sigma_{t+1} e_{t+1} \\right)  + e_{t+1}^T\\Sigma_{t+1}^{-1} e_{t+1}\n\\] The exponent is then a quadratic form implying that the vector \\(\\tilde{x}_{t+1}^T\\) is normal distributed with the appropriate mean and variance-covariance matrix. The definitions are given by \\[\n\\Sigma_{t+1|t+1} F_{t+1}^T\\Sigma_{t+1} e_{t+1} \\; \\; \\mathrm{and} \\; \\;\n\\Sigma_{t+1|t+1} = \\left(  F_{t+1}^T\\Sigma_{t+1}^{-1} F_{t+1} +\n\\Sigma_{t+1|t}^{-1} \\right)  ^{-1}\n\\] respectively. Hence, we obtain the identity \\[\n\\Sigma_{t+1|t+1} = \\left(  F_{t+1}^T\\Sigma_{t+1}^TF_{t+1} + \\Sigma_{t+1|t}^{-1} \\right)  ^{-1} = ( I - K_{t+1} F_{t+1} ) \\Sigma_{t+1|t}\n\\] where \\(K_{t+1} = \\Sigma_{t+1|t} F_{t+1}^T\\left(  F_{t+1} \\Sigma_{t+1|t}^{-1} F_{t+1}^T+ \\Sigma_{t+1} \\right)^{-1}\\) is the Kalman gain matrix.\nThe mean of the \\(\\tilde{x}_{t+1}^T = x_{t+1} - \\mu_{t+1|t}\\) distribution is then \\(K_{t+1}e_{t+1}\\). Un de-meaning the vector, we have \\(x_{t+1} = \\tilde{x}_{t+1} + \\mu_{t+1|t} =K_{t+1}e_{t+1}\\) leads to the following distributional result \\[\np( x_{t+1}|y^{t+1}) \\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(  \\mu_{t+1|t+1},\\Sigma_{t+1|t+1}%\n\\right)  ,\n\\] The moments for the next filtering distribution are given by the classic recursions \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mu_{t+1|t+1}  &  =\\mu_{t+1|t}+K_{t+1}\\left(  y_{t+1}-F_{t+1}\\mu_{t+1|t}\n\\right) \\\\\n\\Sigma_{t+1|t+1}  &  =\\left(  I-K_{t+1}F_{t+1}\\right)  \\Sigma_{t+1|t}\\text{.}%\n\\end{align*}\\] There are two other distributions to compute: the data predictive \\(p( y_{t+1} | y^t )\\) and the state smoothing distribution \\(p( x_t | y^{t+1} )\\). These are derived as follows.\nThe data predictive \\(p(y_{t+1}|y^t)\\) is determined from the observation equation and the state predictive distribution as follows \\[\\begin{align*}\ny_{t+1}  & =F_{t+1}x_{t+1}+\\varepsilon_{t+1} \\; \\text{with} \\;   \\varepsilon_{t+1}\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left( 0,\\Sigma_{t+1}\\right) \\\\\np( x_{t+1} | y^t ) & \\sim \\mathcal{N} \\left ( \\mu_{t+1|t} , \\Sigma_{t+1|t} \\right )  \n\\end{align*}\\] Then substituting we have a predictive distribution for the next observation of the form \\[\np( y_{t+1}|y^{t}) \\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(  F_{t+1}\\mu_{t+1|t},F_{t+1}%\n\\Sigma_{t+1|t} F_{t+1}+\\Sigma_{t+1} \\right)  \\text{.}%\n\\] The state smoothing distribution \\(p(x_t | y^{t+1} )\\) is determined from the joint distribution, \\(p( x_{t} , x_{t+1} | y^{t} )\\) as follows. First, factorise this joint distribution as \\[\np( x_{t+1} , x_{t} | y^{t} ) = p( x_{t+1} | x_{t} ) p( x_{t} | y^{t} )\n\\] Then calculate the conditional posterior distribution, \\(p( x_{t+1} | x_{t} , y^{t+1} )\\) by Bayes rule as \\[\np(x_{t+1}|x_{t},y^{t+1}) = \\frac{p\\left(  y_{t+1}|x_{t+1}\\right)\np(x_{t+1}|x_{t})p(x_{t}|y^{t})}{p(x_{t+1}|y^{t})}%\n\\] Now, we can view the system as having two observations on \\(x_{t+1}\\), namely \\[\\begin{align*}\nx_{t+1} &  =F_{t+1}x_{t}+\\Sigma_{t+1}^{x}\\epsilon_{t+1}^{x}\\\\\nx_{t} &  =\\mu_{t|t}+\\Sigma_{t|t}^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\hat{\\epsilon}_{t}%\n\\end{align*}\\] where the errors \\(\\epsilon_{t+1}^{x},\\hat{\\epsilon}_{t}\\) are independent.\nThis leads to a joint posterior with an exponent that is proportional to \\[\n(x_{t+1}-G_{t+1}x_{t})^T\\left(  \\Sigma\n_{t+1}^{x}\\right)  ^{-1}(x_{t+1}-G_{t+1}x_{t})- (x_{t}-\\mu\n_{t|t})^T\\Sigma_{t|t}^{-1}(x_{t}-\\mu_{t|t})\n\\] The first term comes from the state evolution and the second from the current filtering posterior. Completing the square gives \\[\n(x_{t+1}-G_{t+1}x_{t})^T\\left(  \\Sigma_{t+1}^{x}\\right)  ^{-1}%\n(x_{t+1}-G_{t+1}x_{t})+(x_{t}-\\mu_{t|t})^T\\Sigma_{t|t}^{-1}(x_{t}%\n-\\mu_{t|t})\n\\] \\[\n=(x_{t+1}-\\mu_{t+1|t})^T\\Sigma_{t|t}^{-1}(x_{t+1}-\\mu_{t+1|t}%\n)+(x_{t}-\\mu_{t|t+1})^T\\Sigma_{t|t+1}^{-1}(x_{t}-\\mu_{t|t+1})\n\\] which leads to the smoothed state moments \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mu_{t|t+1} &  =\\Sigma_{t|t+1}\\left(  \\Sigma_{t|t}\\mu_{t|t}+F_{t+1}^T\\left(  \\Sigma_{t+1}^{x}\\right)  ^{-1}x_{t+1}\\right)  \\\\\n\\Sigma_{t|t+1} &  =F_{t+1}^T\\left(  \\Sigma_{t+1}^{x}\\right)^{-1}F_{t+1}+\\Sigma_{t|t}^{-1}%\n\\end{align*}\\] The Kalman filter recursions then follow by induction.\n\nExample 15.4 (Kalman Filter for Robot Localization) The Kalman filter is a powerful tool for estimating the state of a system, given noisy observations. It is used in a wide range of applications, from tracking the position of a robot to estimating the state of a financial market. The Kalman filter is particularly useful when the state of the system is not directly observable, and must be inferred from noisy measurements.\nOften KF is used for localization problem: given noisy measurements about the position of a robot and the motion model of the robot, the Kalman filter can estimate the true position of the robot. The Kalman filter is a recursive algorithm that estimates the state of a system at each time step, based on the state estimate from the previous time step and a new observation. We will use the language of state-space models in this example and will use the notation \\(x_t\\) to denote the state of the system at time \\(t\\) (parameter we are trying to estimate), and \\(y_t\\) to denote the observation at time \\(t\\) (observed data). The state-space model is given by \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_{t+1} & = A x_t + w,\\quad w \\sim N(0,Q)\\\\\ny_t &=G x_t + \\nu, \\quad \\nu \\sim N(0,R)\\\\\nx_0 & \\sim N(\\hat{x}_0, \\Sigma_0),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(A\\) is the state transition matrix, \\(G\\) is the observation matrix, \\(w\\) is the process noise, and \\(\\nu\\) is the observation noise. The process noise and observation noise are assumed to be independent and normally distributed with zero mean and covariance matrices \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\), respectively. The initial state \\(x_0\\) is assumed to be normally distributed with mean \\(\\hat{x}_0\\) and covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma_0\\). The Kalman filter provides a recursive algorithm for estimating the state of the system at each time step, based on the state estimate from the previous time step and a new observation. The state estimate is normal with mean \\(\\hat{x}_t\\) and the covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma_t\\). The Kalman filter equations are given by \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{x}_{t+1} &= A \\hat{x}_t + K_{t} (y_t - G \\hat{x}_t) \\\\\nK_{t} &= A \\Sigma_t G^T (G \\Sigma_t G^T + R)^{-1}\\\\\n\\Sigma_{t+1} &= A \\Sigma_t A^T - K_{t} G \\Sigma_t A^T + Q\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Kalman filter performs a multivariate normal-normal update using \\(N(A \\hat{x}_t,A \\Sigma_t A^T)\\) as prior and \\(N(y_t, G \\Sigma_t G^T + R)\\) as likelihood. The posterior distribution is \\(N(\\hat{x}_{t+1}, \\Sigma_{t+1})\\). Matrix \\(K_{t}\\) is called the Kalman gain and provides a weight on the residual between observed and prior \\(y_t - G \\hat{x}_t\\) in the update.\nAssume our robot starts at \\(\\hat x_0 = (0.2,-0.2)\\) (x-y Cartesian coordinates) and initial covariance is \\[\n\\Sigma_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.4 & 0.3 \\\\ 0.3 & 0.45 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\] The prior distribution of the robot’s position can be visualized in R with a contour plot.\n\nlibrary(mnormt)\nxhat &lt;- c(0.2, -0.2)\nSigma &lt;- matrix(c(0.4, 0.3, \n                  0.3, 0.45), ncol=2)\nx1 &lt;- seq(-2, 4,length=151)\nx2 &lt;- seq(-4, 2,length=151)\nf &lt;- function(x1,x2, mean=xhat, varcov=Sigma) \n  dmnorm(cbind(x1,x2), mean,varcov)\nz &lt;- outer(x1,x2, f)\nmycols &lt;- topo.colors(100,0.5)\nimage(x1,x2,z, col=mycols, main=\"Prior density\",\n      xlab=expression('x'[1]), ylab=expression('x'[2]))\ncontour(x1,x2,z, add=TRUE)\npoints(0.2, -0.2, pch=19)\ntext(0.1, -0.2, labels = expression(hat(x)), adj = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I get readings from GPS \\(y_0 = (2.3, -1.9)\\) and I know from the manufacturer that the GPS has a covariance matrix of \\(R = 0.5\\Sigma_0\\).

This provides the counterpart to the Baum-Welch algorithm developed earlier for HMMs. The details are as follows. The first step is to factorize the joint posterior distribution of the states via \\[\\begin{align*}\np\\left(  x|y^{T}\\right)   &  =p\\left(  x_{T}|y^{T}\\right)  \\prod_{t=1}%\n^{T-1}p\\left(  x_{t}|x_{t+1},...,x_{T},y^{T}\\right)  \\\\\n&  =p\\left(  x_{T}|y^{T}\\right)  \\prod_{t=1}^{T-1}p\\left(  x_{t}|x_{t+1}%\n,y^{t}\\right) \\label{ffbs-1}\n\\end{align*}\\] where we have used the fact that \\(p\\left(  x_{t}|x_{t+1},...,x_{T},y^{T}\\right)  =p\\left(  x_{t}|x_{t+1},y^{T}\\right)\\) by the Markov property (conditional on \\(x_{t+1}\\), \\(x_{t}\\) is independent of all \\(x_{t+2}\\), etc.).\nThis forms the FFBS algorithm: forward-filtering, backward sampling algorithm for generating a block sample from \\(p\\left(  x|y^{T}\\right)\\). Filter forward using the Kalman recursions and obtain a sample from \\(p( x_T|y^T)\\) and then backwards sample using \\(p\\left(x_{t}|x_{t+1},y^{t}\\right)\\) to generate a block draw of \\(x\\). In what follows, we will often write \\[\np\\left(  x|y^{T}\\right)  \\sim FFBS\n\\] to denote that the FFBS algorithm can be used to generate a block draw.\nBackwards Sampling.\nThe distribution of the final state given the data history \\(p( x_{T} | y^{T} )\\) is given by the Kalman filter \\[\np( x_{T}|y^{T}) \\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(  \\mu_{T},\\Sigma_{T}\\right)\n\\] where \\(( \\mu_{T} , \\Sigma_{T} )\\) are computed via the Kalman filter recursions. The second distribution comes from the factorization of \\(p( x_{t}, x_{t+1} | y^{t} )\\) in the derivation of the Kalman filtering recursions. Hence, the conditional state filtering distribution given \\(( x_{t+1} , y^t )\\) is \\[\np( x_{t} | x_{t+1} , y^{t} ) \\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(  \\mu_{t|t+1} ,\n\\Sigma_{t|t+1} \\right)\n\\] where the one-step back smoothed moments are \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mu_{t|t+1}  &  = \\Sigma_{t|t+1} \\left(  \\Sigma_{t|t} \\mu_{t|t} +\nF_{t+1}^T\\left(  \\Sigma^{x}_{t+1} \\right)  ^{-1} x_{t+1} \\right) \\\\\n\\Sigma_{t|t+1}  &  = F_{t+1}^T\\left(  \\Sigma^{x}_{t+1} \\right)  ^{-1}\nF_{t+1} + \\Sigma_{t|t}^{-1}%\n\\end{align*}\\] as computed above. Then we can sequentially sample from this distribution.\n\n\nHMM: Hidden Markov Models\nThe algorithms described in this section were originally developed by Baum et al. (1970) and Viterbi (1967). Baum developed original trading algorithms for Renaissance Technology which later became a multi-billion dollar hedge fund. The algorithms are also known as the Baum-Welch and Viterbi algorithms, respectively. They are used to estimate the parameters of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) from a sequence of observations. The HMM is a statistical model that describes a system that is assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved (hidden) states. These algorithms are now widely used in many applications, including speech recognition, bioinformatics, and finance.\nViterbi, on the other hand, was one of the founders of what is now known as Qualcomm, a multi-billion dollar semiconductor and telecommunications equipment company. Viterbi’s algorithm is used to find the most likely sequence of hidden states in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) given a sequence of observations.\nBaum-Welch (1970) and Viterbi (1967) are the two famous discrete HMM algorithms.\nConsider a model with a Hidden Chain or regime-switching variable\n\\[\ny_{t} = \\mu\\left( x_{t}\\right) + \\sigma\\left( x_{t}\\right) \\varepsilon _{t}\\text{.}\n\\]\nSuppose that \\(x_{t}\\) is a finite state Markov chain with a time-homogeneous transition matrix P with entries \\(\\left\\{ p_{ij}\\right\\}\\) which are given by\n\\[\np_{ij} = P\\left( x_{t} = i | x_{t-1} = j, \\theta\\right) \\text{.}\n\\]\nWe define the marginal filtering and smoothing distributions\n\\[\np_{i}^{t,t} = P\\left( x_{t} = i | \\theta, y^{t}\\right) \\text{ and } p_{i}^{t,T} = P\\left( x_{t} = i | \\theta, y^{T}\\right)\n\\]\nand the corresponding joint filtering and smoothing matrices:\n\\[\np_{ij}^{t,t} = P\\left( x_{t-1} = i, x_{t} = j | \\theta, y^{t}\\right) \\text{ and } p_{ij}^{t,T} = P\\left( x_{t-1} = i, x_{t} = j | \\theta, y^{T}\\right) \\text{.}\n\\]\nThe key to the algorithm is that we are just going to track the joint matrices, and then peel-off marginals from the rows and columns.\n\nForward-filtering\nTo derive the forward equations\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np_{ij}^{t,t} & = P\\left( x_{t-1} = i, x_{t} = j | \\theta, y^{t}\\right) \\propto p\\left( y_{t}, x_{t-1} = i, x_{t} = j | \\theta, y^{t-1}\\right) \\\\\n& \\propto p\\left( y_{t} | x_{t} = j, \\theta\\right) p\\left( x_{t} = j | x_{t-1} = i, \\theta\\right) p\\left( x_{t-1} = i | \\theta, y^{t-1}\\right) \\\\\n& \\propto p\\left( y_{t} | x_{t} = j, \\theta\\right) p_{ij}\\left( p_{i}^{t-1,t-1}\\right) \\text{.}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis shows how to compute today’s filtering distribution given the likelihood. The advantage of this is that it only requires matrix multiplication.\n\n\nBackward-sampling\nThe result of the forward-filtering is the final observation \\(p_{ij}^{T,T}\\). Like in the previous section, we can then filter in reverse to compute \\(p_{ij}^{t,T}\\), which is required for the MCMC algorithm. We have that\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np_{ij}^{t,T} & = p\\left( x_{t-1} = i, x_{t} = j | \\theta, y^{T}\\right) \\\\\n& \\propto p\\left( x_{t-1} = i | x_{t} = j, \\theta, y^{T}\\right) p\\left( x_{t} = j | \\theta, y^{T}\\right) \\\\\n& \\propto p\\left( x_{t-1} = i | x_{t} = j, \\theta, y^{t}\\right) p\\left( x_{t} = j | \\theta, y^{T}\\right) \\\\\n& \\propto \\frac{p\\left( x_{t-1} = i, x_{t} = j | \\theta, y^{t}\\right)}{p\\left( x_{t} = j | \\theta, y^{t}\\right)} p\\left( x_{t} = j | \\theta, y^{T}\\right) \\\\\n& \\propto p_{ij}^{t,t} \\frac{p_{j}^{t,T}}{p_{j}^{t,t}} \\text{.}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn deriving this, we have used the fact that\n\\[\np\\left( x_{t-1} = i | x_{t} = j, \\theta, y^{T}\\right) \\propto p\\left( x_{t-1} = i | x_{t} = j, \\theta , y^{t}\\right)\n\\]\nbecause conditional time \\(t\\) information, the past transition is independent of the future. This is the discrete-state version of the FFBS algorithm.\n\n\nSmoothing: Forwards and Backwards\nLet \\(y^T = \\{y_1, \\dots, y_T\\}\\) be a sequence of random variables where the conditional distribution\n\\[\np(y^T | x^T) = p (y_1 | x_1 ) \\prod_{t=2}^T p(y_t | x_t, y_{t-1})\n\\]\nwhere we suppress the dependence of the mixture components on a parameter \\(\\theta\\). The full smoothing distribution can be written\n\\[\np( x | y ) = p( x_T | y^T ) \\prod_{t=1}^{T-1} p( x_t | x_{t+1} , \\theta , y_{t+1} )\n\\]\nSuppose \\(\\{x_t\\}\\) follows a finite state Markov chain with initial distribution \\(\\pi_0\\) and transition probabilities\n\\[\nQ_t(r,s) = Pr(x_t = s | x_{t-1} = r) \\; \\; \\mathrm{and} \\; \\; P_t ( t, r ,s) = Pr(x_{t-1} = r, x_t = s | y_1^t)\n\\]\nwhich we will compute sequentially. Let the current filtering distribution of the state be given by, for \\(t &gt; 0\\),\n\\[\np_t(s) = Pr(x_t = s | y^t) \\; \\; \\mathrm{and} \\; \\; A_t(x_{t-1}, x_t, y_t) = p(x_{t-1}, x_t, y_t | y^{t-1})\n\\]\nBy definition,\n\\[\nA_t(r,s,y_t) = \\frac{p_{t-1}(r) Q_t(r,s)}{p(y_t | y_{t-1})}.\n\\tag{15.1}\\]\nwhere the marginal likelihood is given by\n\\[\np(y_t | y_{1}^{t-1}) = \\sum_{r,s} A_t(r,s,y_t)\n\\]\nThe filtered transition distribution\n\\[\np_{trs} = A_t(r,s,y_t) / p(y_t | y^{t-1})\n\\]\nThe forward-backward recursions are used to efficiently compute the observed data likelihood\n\\[\np(y) = \\sum_{ x } p(y | x)p( x )\n\\]\nwhere \\(x = ( x_1 , \\ldots , x_T )\\). We also need the posterior distribution \\(p( x | y )\\) of the latent Markov chain given observed data. The recursions consist of a forward step that computes the distribution of the \\(t\\)’th transition given all the data up to time \\(t\\), and a backward recursion that updates each distribution to condition on all observed data.\nThe forward recursion operates on the set of transition distributions, represented by a sequence of matrices \\(P_t = ( p_{trs} )\\). Computing\n\\[\np_t(s) = \\sum_{r}p_{trs}\n\\]\nsets up the next step in the recursion. The recursion is initialized by replacing \\(p\\) with \\(p^0\\) in equation Equation 15.1.\nThe observed data log-likelihood can be computed as\n\\[\n\\log p(y) = \\log p(y_1) + \\sum_{t=2}^T \\log p(y_t | y^{t-1})\n\\]\nWith appropriate use of logarithms, \\(p\\) and \\(p(y_t | y^{t-1})\\) need only ever be evaluated on the log scale.\nThe stochastic version of the backward recursion simulates from\n\\[\np(x | y).\n\\]\nBegin with the factorization\n\\[\n\\label{eq:bkwd} p(x | y) = p(x_T | y^T) \\prod_{t=1}^{T-1} p(x_{t} | x_{t+1}^T, y).\n\\]\nThen notice that, given \\(x_{t+1}\\), \\(x_t\\) is conditionally independent of \\(y_{t+1}^T\\) and all later \\(x\\)’s. Thus\n\\[\np(x_t | x_{t+1}, y) = P(x_t = r | x_{t+1} = s, y^{t+1}) \\propto p_{t+1rs}\n\\]\nTherefore, if one samples \\((x_{t-1}, x_t)\\) from the discrete bivariate distribution given by \\(P_t\\) and then repeatedly samples \\(x_t\\) from a multinomial distribution proportional to column \\(x_{t+1}\\) of \\(P_{t+1}\\) then \\(x=(x_1, \\ldots , x_T)\\) is a draw from \\(p(x|y)\\).\n\n\n\nMixture Kalman filter\nWe can also introduce a \\(\\lambda_t\\) state variable and consider a system\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_t & = F_{\\lambda_t} x_t + D_{\\lambda_t} \\epsilon_t  \\\\\nx_t & = G_{\\lambda_t} x_{t-1} + B_{\\lambda_t} v_t\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe Kalman filter gives moments of the state filtering distribution\n\\[\nx_t | \\lambda^t , y^t \\sim \\mathcal{N} \\left ( \\mu_{t|t} , \\Sigma_{t|t} \\right )\n\\]\nHere we assume that the iid auxiliary state variable shocks \\(\\lambda_t \\sim p( \\lambda_t )\\).\nFirst we marginalize over the state variable \\(x_t\\). Then we can track the sufficient statistics for the hidden \\(z_t\\) variable dynamically in time, namely \\(\\left ( z_{t|t} , S_t \\right )\\), just the Kalman filter moments, in the conditionally Gaussian and discrete cases Lindgren (1978). Then we re-sample \\(( z_{t|t} , S_t  , \\theta )^{(i)}\\) particles.\n\n\nRegime Switching Models\nThe general form of a continuous-time regime switching model is\n\\[\ndy_{t}=\\mu\\left(  \\theta,x_{t},y_{t}\\right)  dt+\\sigma\\left(  \\theta\n,x_{t},y_{t}\\right)  d B_{t}%\n\\]\nwhere \\(x_{t}\\) takes values in a discrete space with transition matrix \\(P_{ij}\\left(  t\\right)\\) with parameters \\(\\theta=\\left(  \\theta_{1},\\ldots,\\theta_{J}\\right)\\). Common specifications assume the drift and diffusion coefficients are parametric functions and the parameters switch over time. In this case, it is common to write the model as\n\\[\ndy_{t}=\\mu\\left(  \\theta_{x_{t}},y_{t}\\right)  dt+\\sigma\\left(  \\theta_{x_{t}%\n},y_{t}\\right)  d B_{t}\\text{.}%\n\\]\nScott (2002) provides a fast MCMC algorithm for state filtering by adapting the FFBS algorithm. Time discretized the model is:\n\\[\ny_{t}=\\mu\\left(  \\theta_{x_{t}},y_{t-1}\\right)  +\\sigma\\left(  \\theta_{x_{t}%\n},y_{t-1}\\right)  \\varepsilon_{t}\\text{.}%\n\\]\nNote that we use the standard notation from discrete-time models where the time index on the Markov state is equal to the current observation. The discrete-time transition probabilities are\n\\[\np_{ij}=P\\left(  x_{t}=i|x_{t-1}=j\\right)\n\\]\nand we assume, apriori, that the transition functions are time and state invariant. The joint likelihood is given by\n\\[\np\\left(  y| x,\\theta\\right)  = \\prod_{t=1}^{T} p\\left(  y_{t}|y_{t-1}%\n,x_{t-1},\\theta\\right)\\]\nwhere \\(p\\left(  y_{t}|y_{t-1},x_{t-1},\\theta\\right)  =N\\left(  \\mu\\left(\n\\theta_{x_{t-1}},y_{t-1}\\right)  ,\\sigma^{2}\\left(  \\theta_{x_{t-1}}%\n,y_{t-1}\\right)  \\right)\\).\nClifford-Hammersley implies that the complete conditionals are given by \\(p\\left(  \\theta| x ,s , y \\right)\\), \\(p\\left(  s | x , \\theta, y \\right)\\), and \\(p\\left(  x | s ,\\theta, y \\right)\\). Conditional on the states and the transition probabilities, updating the parameters is straightforward. Conditional on the states, the transition matrix has a Dirchlet distribution, and updating this is also straightforward. To update the states use FFBS.\nAn important component of regime switching models is the prior distribution. Regime switching models (and most mixture models) are not formally identified. For example, in all regime switching models, there is a labeling problem: there is no unique way to identify the states. A common approach to overcome this identification issue is to order the parameters.\n\nChangepoint Problems\nSmith (1975) introduced the single changepoint problem from a Bayesian perspective. Consider a sequence of random variables \\(y_{1} , \\ldots, y_{T}\\) which has a change-point at time \\(\\tau\\) in the sense that\n\\[\ny_t | \\theta_{k} \\sim    \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}[c]{l}\np( y | \\theta_{1} ) \\; \\; \\; \\; \\; \\; \\mathrm{for} \\; \\; 1 \\leq i \\leq\\tau \\\\\np( y | \\theta_{2} ) \\; \\; \\; \\; \\; \\; \\mathrm{for} \\; \\; \\tau+1 \\leq\ni \\leq T\n\\end{array}  \\right\\}\\]\nThis can be rewritten as a state space model\n\\[\ny_t = \\theta_{ x_t } + \\sigma_{ x_t } \\epsilon_t\n\\]\nwhere \\(x_t\\) has a Markov transition evolution.\nAn idea that appears to be under-exploited is that of “model reparametrisation”. The multiple change-point problem, which is computationally expensive if approached directly, has a natural model reparametrisation that makes the implementation of MCMC methods straightforward (see Chib (1998)). Specifically, suppose that the data generating process \\(y^{T} = \\{ y_{1} , \\ldots, y_{T} \\}\\) is given by a sequence of conditionals \\(f ( y_{t} | y^{t-1} , \\theta_{k} )\\) for parameters \\(\\theta_{k}\\) that change at unknown change-points \\(\\{ \\tau_{1} , \\ldots,\n\\tau_{k} \\}\\).\nThe model parameterization is based on using a hidden Markov state space model with a vector of latent variables \\(s_{t}\\) where \\(s_{t}\n= k\\) indicates that \\(y_{t}\\) is drawn from \\(p ( y_{t} | y^{t-1} ,\n\\theta_{k} )\\). Let the prior distribution on the \\(s_{t}\\)’s have transition matrix where \\(p_{ij} = P \\left(  s_{t} = j | s_{t-1} = i\n\\right)\\) is the probability of jumping regimes. With this model parameterization the \\(k\\)th change occurs at \\(\\tau_{k}\\) if \\(s_{\n\\tau_{k} } = k\\) and \\(s_{ \\tau_{k} + 1 } = k + 1\\). The reparameterisation automatically enforces the order constraints on the change-points and is it very easy to perform MCMC analysis on the posterior distribution. This provides a more efficient strategy for posterior computation. MCMC analysis of the \\(s_{t}\\)’s is straightforward and the posterior for the \\(\\tau_{k}\\)’s can be obtained by inverting the definition above. Hence\n\\[\np( \\tau = t | y ) = p( x_t =1 | y )\n\\]\nThe alternative is single state updating conditional on \\(\\tau\\) which is slow for finding the multiple-changeponts.",

    "text": "15.6 Particle Learning for General Mixture Models\nParticle learning (PL) offers a powerful and flexible approach for sequential inference in general mixture models. Unlike traditional MCMC methods, which require repeated passes over the entire dataset and can be computationally demanding, particle learning operates in an online fashion. This means it can efficiently update inference as new data arrives, making it particularly well-suited for large or high-dimensional datasets and real-time applications.\nThe particle learning framework is designed to efficiently and sequentially learn from a broad class of mixture models. At its core, the approach models data as arising from a mixture distribution:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\int k(z;\\theta) d G(\\theta)\n\\]\nwhere \\(G\\) is a discrete mixing measure and \\(k(z;\\theta)\\) is a kernel parameterized by \\(\\theta\\). The generality of this formulation allows PL to be applied to a wide variety of models, including finite mixture models, Dirichlet process mixtures, Indian buffet processes, and probit stick-breaking models. This flexibility is a significant advantage, as it enables practitioners to use PL across many settings without needing to redesign the inference algorithm for each new model structure.\nIn addition to its generality, particle learning provides an alternative to MCMC for tasks such as online model fitting, marginal likelihood estimation, and posterior cluster allocation. Its sequential nature makes it particularly attractive for streaming data and scenarios where computational resources are limited.\nA general mixture model can be described by three components: a likelihood, a transition equation for latent allocations, and a prior over parameters. Specifically,\n\nThe likelihood is given by \\(p(y_{t+1} | k_{t+1}, \\theta)\\), representing the probability of the next observation given the current allocation and parameters.\nThe transition equation \\(p(k_{t+1} | k^t, \\theta)\\) governs how the latent allocation variables evolve over time, where \\(k^t = \\{k_1,\\ldots, k_t\\}\\) denotes the history of allocations.\nThe parameter prior \\(p(\\theta)\\) encodes prior beliefs about the mixture component parameters.\n\nThis structure can be expressed in a state-space form:\n\\[\\begin{align}\ny_{t+1} &= f(k_{t+1}, \\theta) \\\\\nk_{t+1} &= g(k^t, \\theta)\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere the first equation is the observation model and the second describes the evolution of the latent allocation states.\nThe mixture modeling framework described above is closely related to hidden Markov models (HMMs). In this context, the observed data \\(y_t\\) are assumed to be generated from a mixture, with allocation variables \\(k_t\\) determining which mixture component is responsible for each observation. The parameters \\(\\theta_{k_t}\\) for each component are drawn from the mixing measure \\(G\\). This structure allows for both standard mixture models, where each observation is assigned to a single component, and more general latent feature models, where multivariate allocation variables \\(k_t\\) allow an observation to be associated with multiple components simultaneously.\nA central concept in particle learning is the essential state vector \\(\\mathcal{Z}_t\\), which is tracked over time. This vector is constructed to be sufficient for sequential inference, meaning that it contains all the information needed to compute the posterior predictive distribution for new data, update the state as new observations arrive, and learn about the underlying parameters:\n\nPosterior predictive: \\(p(y_{t+1} | \\mathcal{Z}_t)\\)\nPosterior updating: \\(p(\\mathcal{Z}_{t+1} | \\mathcal{Z}_t, y_{t+1})\\)\nParameter learning: \\(p(\\theta | \\mathcal{Z}_{t+1})\\)\n\n\nThe Particle Learning Algorithm\nParticle learning approximates the posterior distribution \\(p(\\mathcal{Z}_t | y^t)\\) with a set of equally weighted particles \\(\\{\\mathcal{Z}_t^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^N\\). When a new observation \\(y_{t+1}\\) becomes available, the algorithm proceeds in two main steps:\n\nResample: The current set of particles is resampled with weights proportional to the predictive likelihood \\(p(y_{t+1} | \\mathcal{Z}_t^{(i)})\\). This step focuses computational effort on the most plausible states given the new data.\nPropagate: Each resampled particle is then propagated forward by sampling from the transition distribution \\(p(\\mathcal{Z}_{t+1} | \\mathcal{Z}_t^{(i)}, y_{t+1})\\), thus updating the state to incorporate the new observation.\n\nThis two-step process is grounded in Bayes’ theorem, where the resampling step corresponds to updating the posterior with the new data, and the propagation step advances the state according to the model dynamics. After these steps, the set of particles provides an updated approximation to the posterior \\(p(\\mathcal{Z}_{t+1} | y^{t+1})\\).\nOne important distinction between particle learning and standard particle filtering methods is that the essential state vector \\(\\mathcal{Z}_t\\) does not necessarily need to include the full history of allocation variables \\(k^t\\) to be sufficient for inference. This makes PL both more efficient and more flexible than many existing particle filtering approaches for mixture models. Furthermore, the order of resampling and propagation steps is reversed compared to standard filters, which helps mitigate particle degeneracy and improves performance in mixture modeling contexts.\nParticle learning also provides an efficient mechanism for sampling from the full posterior distribution of the allocation vector \\(p(k^t | y^t)\\). This is achieved using a backwards uncertainty update, which allows for the recovery of smoothed samples of the allocation history. For each particle, and for each time step in reverse order, the allocation variable \\(k_r\\) is sampled with probability proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior for that allocation, given the state vector. This results in an algorithm with computational complexity linear in the number of particles, making it practical even for large datasets.\nThe particle learning framework is applicable to a wide range of density estimation problems involving mixtures of the form\n\\[\nf(y;G) = \\int k(y ; \\theta) dG(\\theta)\n\\]\nThere are many possible choices for the prior on the mixing measure \\(G\\). Common examples include finite mixture models, which use a finite number of components; Dirichlet process mixtures, which allow for an infinite number of components via a stick-breaking construction; beta two-parameter processes; and kernel stick-breaking processes. Each of these priors offers different modeling flexibility and computational properties, and the choice depends on the specific application and desired level of model complexity.\nIn some cases, it is useful to consider a collapsed state-space model, where the predictive distribution for a new observation is expressed as an expectation over the mixing measure \\(G\\) given the current state vector:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[f(y_{t+1};G) | \\mathcal{Z}_t] = \\int k(y_{t+1};\\theta) d \\mathbb{E}[G(\\theta) | \\mathcal{Z}_t]\n\\]\nIf \\(t\\) observations have been allocated to \\(m_t\\) mixture components, the posterior expectation of \\(G\\) can be written as a weighted sum of the base measure and point masses at the component parameters. The predictive density then combines contributions from both new and existing components, weighted according to their posterior probabilities.\nParticle learning offers a versatile and efficient framework for sequential inference in general mixture models. By representing the posterior with a set of particles and updating these particles as new data arrives, PL enables real-time model fitting, efficient posterior allocation, and flexible density estimation across a wide range of mixture modeling scenarios. Its ability to handle both finite and infinite mixture models, as well as latent feature models, makes it a valuable tool for modern statistical analysis.\n\nExample 15.5 (Particle Learning for Poisson Mixture Models) We will implement Particle Learning (PL) for a finite mixture of Poisson distributions based on the example from Carvalho et al. (2010). This example follows Algorithm 1 for finite mixture models from Section 2.1 of the paper.\nWe generate data from a mixture of two Poisson distributions (\\(\\lambda_1=2\\) with weight 0.7, \\(\\lambda_2\\)=10 with weight 0.3).\n\nset.seed(8) # Ovi\n# Simulate data (500 observations)\nn_obs &lt;- 500\ntrue_z &lt;- sample(1:2, n_obs, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.7, 0.3))\ny &lt;- ifelse(true_z == 1, rpois(n_obs, 2), rpois(n_obs, 10))\n\n\n\nCode\n# Plot two empirical density plots for each mixture component.

PL Algorithm: - Resample: Particles are weighted by the posterior predictive probability of the next observation - Propagate: For each particle: - Compute component allocation probabilities - Sample component assignment - Update sufficient statistics - Learn: Store posterior estimates of \\(\\lambda\\) parameters and mixture weights\nThe key features of this implementation are the use of posterior predictive with Poisson-Gamma conjugacy and allocation of probabilities by combining prior weights and likelihood.\n\n\nCode\n# Model parameters\nm &lt;- 2  # Number of components\nalpha &lt;- c(1, 1)  # Gamma prior shape parameters\nbeta &lt;- c(1, 1)   # Gamma prior rate parameters\ngamma &lt;- c(1, 1)  # Dirichlet prior parameters\nn_particles &lt;- 1000  # Number of particles\n\n# Initialize particles\nparticles &lt;- lapply(1:n_particles, function(i) {\n  list(s = c(0, 0),    # Sufficient statistics (sum of y in each component)\n       n = c(0, 0))    # Counts per component\n})\n\n# Store posterior samples\nposterior_lambda &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = n_obs, ncol = m)\nposterior_weights &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = n_obs, ncol = m)\n\n# Particle Learning algorithm\nfor (t in 1:n_obs) {\n  y_t &lt;- y[t]\n  log_weights &lt;- numeric(n_particles)\n  \n  # 1.

    "text": "15.7 Modern Era Forecasting\nA recent post by the Amazon Science group Amazon (2021) describes the evolution of the time series algorithms used for forecasting from 2007 to 2021. Figure below shows the entire evolution of the algorithms.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey went from standard textbook time series forecasting methods to make predictions to the quantile-based transformer models. The main problem of the traditional TS models is that they assume stationary. A stationary time series is one whose properties do not depend on the time at which the series is observed. For example, a white noise series is stationary - it does not matter when you observe it, it should look much the same at any point in time.\n\nyt = rnorm(100)\nplot(yt,type='l')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, all the coefficients of a time series model do not change over time. We know how to deal with trends and seasonality quite well. Thus, those types of non-stationary are not an issue. Below some of the example of time series data. Although most of those are not stationary, we can model them using traditional techniques (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2021)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.8: Which of these series are stationary? (a) Dow Jones index on 292 consecutive days; (b) Daily change in the Dow Jones index on 292 consecutive days; (c) Annual number of strikes in the US; (d) Monthly sales of new one-family houses sold in the US; (e) Annual price of a dozen eggs in the US (constant dollars); (f) Monthly total of pigs slaughtered in Victoria, Australia; (g) Annual total of lynx trapped in the McKenzie River district of north-west Canada; (h) Monthly Australian beer production; (i) Monthly Australian electricity production.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, when you try to forecast for a time series with no prior history or non-recurrent “jumps”, like recessions, traditional models are unlikely to work well.\nAmazon used a sequence of “patches” to hack the model and to make it produce useful results. All of those required manual feature engineering and led to less transparent and fragile models. One solution is to use random forests.",

    "text": "15.8 Quantile Regression Forests.\nMost estimators during prediction return \\(E(Y|X)\\), which can be interpreted as the answer to the question, what is the expected value of your output given the input?\nQuantile methods, return \\(y\\) at \\(q\\) for which \\(F(Y=y|X)=q\\) where \\(q\\) is the percentile and \\(y\\) is the quantile. One quick use-case where this is useful is when there are a number of outliers which can influence the conditional mean. It is sometimes important to obtain estimates at different percentiles, (when grading on a curve is done for instance.)\nNote, Bayesian models return the entire distribution of \\(P(Y|X)\\).\nIt is fairly straightforward to extend a standard decision tree to provide predictions at percentiles. When a decision tree is fit, the trick is to store not only the sufficient statistics of the target at the leaf node such as the mean and variance but also all the target values in the leaf node. At prediction, these are used to compute empirical quantile estimates.\nThe same approach can be extended to Random Forests. To estimate \\(F(Y=y|x)=q\\) each target value in training \\(y\\)s is given a weight. Formally, the weight given to \\(y_j\\) while estimating the quantile is \\[\n\\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{\\mathbb{1}(y_j \\in L(x))}{\\sum_{i=1}^N \\mathbb{1}(y_i \\in L(x))},\n\\] where \\(L(x)\\) denotes the leaf that \\(x\\) falls into.\nInformally, what it means that for a new unknown sample, we first find the leaf that it falls into at each tree. Then for each \\((X, y)\\) in the training data, a weight is given to \\(y\\) at each tree in the following manner.\n\nIf it is in the same leaf as the new sample, then the weight is the fraction of samples in the same leaf.\nIf not, then the weight is zero.\n\nThese weights for each y are summed up across all trees and averaged. Now since we have an array of target values and an array of weights corresponding to these target values, we can use this to measure empirical quantile estimates.\nMotivated by the success of gradient boosting models for predicting Walmart sales (kaggle (2020)), Januschowski et al.

    "text": "16.1 The Question of Causation\nFlorence Nightingale (1820-1910) was a heroine of the Crimean War, Patron Saint of Nurses, admirer of Quetelet, and champion of the statistical study of society. She can be called the mother of observational studies. To her, every piece of legislation was an experiment in the laboratory of society deserving study and demanding evaluation. Nightingale recognized the importance of collecting accurate and reliable data to understand healthcare outcomes. She developed standardized methods for collecting data on hospital admissions, deaths, causes of death, and other relevant factors. This systematic data collection allowed for more rigorous and reliable analysis of healthcare practices and their impact on patient outcomes. During the Crimean War (1853-1856), she collected and analyzed data on mortality rates among soldiers. She created statistical diagrams, such as the famous polar area diagram or “coxcomb,” to illustrate the causes of mortality. These visual representations helped to convey complex information in a clear and understandable way. Nightingale’s observations and statistical analyses led her to emphasize the importance of sanitation and hygiene in healthcare settings. She advocated for improvements in cleanliness, ventilation, and sanitation in hospitals, recognizing the impact of these factors on the health and well-being of patients. Beyond the battlefield, Nightingale continued her work in public health. She used statistical evidence to advocate for healthcare reforms and improvements in public health infrastructure. Her efforts played a crucial role in shaping public health policies and practices.\nThe work of Nightingale would nowadays be called an observational study. An observational study is a research design where researchers observe and collect data on existing groups of people or phenomena without intervening or manipulating any variables. Unlike randomized controlled trials, researchers do not assign participants to different groups and do not directly influence the outcome.\nGeorge Washington (1732-1799), on the other hand, had made an enormous fortune in farming, and one of the distinguishing features of his farming practices was the use of what we nowadays call a controlled experiment. He was deeply interested in improving agricultural techniques and conducted numerous experiments at his Mount Vernon estate. One of his most notable experiments involved dividing his land into plots and testing different crop rotations and fertilization methods. Washington recognized the importance of sustainable agriculture and the detrimental effects of monoculture (growing the same crop year after year) on soil fertility. He observed how tobacco, his primary cash crop at the time, depleted the soil nutrients, leading to diminishing yields. To address this issue and improve the long-term health of his land, he began experimenting with crop rotation and soil management techniques.\nWashington divided his land into several plots, each receiving different treatments. He experimented with various crop rotations, including wheat-fallow, wheat-rye-fallow, and corn-wheat-fallow. These rotations aimed to prevent soil depletion and promote its natural restoration by planting nitrogen-fixing crops like rye and clover. He also tested different fertilizer applications on various plots. He used manure, compost, and even imported materials like gypsum and marl to improve soil fertility and crop yields.\nWashington meticulously documented his experiments in his agricultural diaries. He recorded planting dates, yields, weather conditions, and observations on crop growth and soil health. This meticulous record-keeping allowed him to analyze the effectiveness of different treatments and compare their impact on crop yields and soil quality.\nWashington’s experiments yielded valuable insights into sustainable agricultural practices. He discovered that crop rotation and fertilization improved soil health and increased crop yields over time. He abandoned tobacco as his primary crop and shifted towards wheat, which was less soil-depleting and offered a more stable income source.\nThe historic trades staff at Mount Vernon have recreated Washington’s experiment at the Pioneer Farm, using the same plot layout, crops, and fertilization methods described in his diaries. This allows visitors to learn about his innovative farming techniques and their impact on the land. Figure 16.1 shows the plot layout at the Pioneer Farm.\nGeorge Washington’s commitment to experimentation and innovation made him a pioneer in American agriculture. His plot-based experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of crop rotation and soil management in promoting sustainable farming practices. His work continues to inspire farmers today and serves as a valuable resource for understanding agricultural history and best practices.\nLater, at the turn of the 20th century, Ronald Fisher (1890-1962) developed the theory of experimental design which allowed for controlled experiments, known as randomized controlled trials (RCT). Fisher’s work laid the foundation for modern experimental design and analysis, providing a rigorous statistical framework for conducting randomized controlled trials. His contributions to experimental design and ANOVA were crucial in establishing the importance of randomized trials in research. He emphasized the importance of randomization and control groups in experimental design, recognizing their crucial role in establishing causal relationships.\nThe modern randomized controlled trial (RCT) in medicine is most often attributed to Sir Austin Bradford Hill. In 1948, Hill published a landmark paper titled “Streptomycin Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis” in the British Medical Journal, which described the first fully randomized, double-blind clinical trial. This study is considered a turning point in the history of medical research and established the RCT as the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of medical treatments.\nRandomized trials and observational studies are two distinct approaches to gathering and analyzing data in research studies. Here’s a breakdown of their key differences:\nIf you happen to have a choice between randomized trials and observational data (often you do not have that choice), which one should you choose? Here are a few things to consider:\nUltimately, both randomized trials and observational data play crucial roles in research. Combining these two approaches can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between interventions and outcomes.\nRothamsted t-ratios split-plot designs\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) and field experiments are considered the gold standard for establishing causation because they allow researchers to isolate the effect of a specific intervention or treatment from other confounding factors. The main principle of RCTs and field experiments is randomization, which ensures that the treatment and control groups are similar in all respects except for the treatment. This allows researchers to attribute any differences in outcomes between the two groups to the treatment, rather than to other factors. Randomization helps to control for confounding variables, which are factors that are associated with both the treatment and the outcome variable. By randomly assigning participants to groups, researchers can ensure that any confounding variables are evenly distributed between the groups. The control group serves as a baseline for comparison. It is a group that is not exposed to the treatment or intervention being studied. By comparing the outcomes of the treatment group and the control group, researchers can isolate the effect of the treatment. Any differences in the outcomes between the two groups can be attributed to the treatment, rather than to other factors.\nFor many years, the main areas of application of randomized trials were medicine and agriculture. In medicine, randomized trials are used to test the effectiveness of new drugs and treatments. In agriculture, randomized trials are used to test the effectiveness of new fertilizers, pesticides, and other agricultural inputs. However, with the rise of the internet, randomized trials have become increasingly popular for testing the effectiveness of online interventions, such as email campaigns, website designs, and social media ads. When applied to user experience and marketing, randomized trials are often called A/B tests. The idea of A/B testing is the same: randomly assign users to different versions of a website or an email campaign and compare the outcomes. However, the level or “rigor” of designing the experiment is often lower than in medicine or agriculture. There are fewer strict rules about ethics, randomization, sample size, and statistical analysis. For example, randomization is sometimes completely ignored in A/B testing. Instead of assigning users randomly to groups, they are divided into groups based on factors like time of day, location, or browsing history. This can introduce bias into the results, as the groups may not be comparable. As a result, A/B testing is cheap and quick to conduct, as it can be done online without the need for IRB approval or recruitment of participants. Participants most of the time do not even know that they are participating in an A/B experiment. Furthermore, A/B testing is primarily focused on measuring the comparative performance of variations without necessarily establishing a causal relationship. It answers questions like, “Which version of our web page leads to more clicks?”\nYet another area where RCTs are becoming popular is economic studies. For example, randomized trials are used to test the effectiveness of educational interventions, such as tutoring programs and online courses. In recent years, randomized trials have been used to study a wide range of other phenomena, including education, economics, and public policy.\nWhile RCTs and field experiments are powerful tools for establishing causation, they are not always feasible or ethical. In some cases, observational studies may be the best way to study a particular phenomenon. However, even in observational studies, researchers can use techniques such as matching and instrumental variables to try to control for confounding variables. It is important to remember that even RCTs and field experiments cannot definitively prove causation. However, they provide the strongest evidence possible for a causal relationship between a treatment or intervention and an outcome.\nDiane Lambert was the original statistician who promoted the ideas of proper statistical usage of observational data among internet companies. She has presented on how to detect selection bias in data streams drawn from transaction logs, ad-systems, etc.; diagnostics to judge when bias overwhelms signal; and practical fixes such as propensity-score weighting, doubly-robust estimators, post-stratification, and simulation so that credible causal conclusions can still be drawn from field/observational data. For example, at JSM 2011 (Miami) she co-authored the session “The Effectiveness of Display Ads,” contrasting large-scale field experiments with observational analyses of ad-click logs.\nThe advent of digital data has fundamentally transformed the practice of statistics, shifting the field from a discipline focused on small, carefully collected samples to one that must grapple with massive, often messy datasets generated as byproducts of digital systems. In the pre-digital era, statisticians worked primarily with structured, purposefully collected data through surveys, experiments, and clinical trials, where the sample size was a critical constraint and every observation was expensive to obtain. Today, organizations routinely collect terabytes of data from web traffic, sensor networks, financial transactions, and social media interactions, creating what some have called a “data deluge.” This shift has necessitated new statistical approaches that can handle high-dimensional data, complex dependencies, and the computational challenges of scale. Machine learning algorithms, once considered separate from traditional statistics, have become essential tools for extracting patterns from these vast datasets. However, this transition has also introduced new challenges: the need to distinguish correlation from causation in observational data, the importance of addressing selection bias in non-random samples, and the ethical considerations of privacy and algorithmic fairness. The field has evolved to embrace both the opportunities presented by big data—such as the ability to detect subtle patterns and make real-time predictions—and the responsibility to develop robust methods that can provide reliable insights despite the inherent noise and complexity of digital data sources.\nMarkets give signals in the form of betting odds, e.g., Polymarket uses collective thought to produce a signal. It often happens that the collective thought outperforms the best experts.",

    "section": "16.2 BART For Causal Inference",
    "text": "16.2 BART For Causal Inference\nEstimating the causal effect of an intervention, such as a new drug, a marketing campaign, or a public policy, is a central goal across science and industry. While the gold standard for causal inference is the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), it is often infeasible, unethical, or too expensive to conduct. Researchers must therefore turn to observational data, where the assignment of treatment is not controlled by the investigator. This introduces a fundamental challenge: individuals who receive the treatment may be systematically different from those who do not, a problem known as confounding. Separating the true effect of the treatment from these pre-existing differences is the primary task of causal inference from observational data.\nTo formalize causal questions, we rely on the Rubin Causal Model (RCM), also known as the potential outcomes framework. For a binary treatment \\(Z\\) (where \\(Z_i=1\\) if individual \\(i\\) receives the treatment and \\(Z_i=0\\) otherwise), we posit that each individual \\(i\\) has two potential outcomes: * \\(Y_i(1)\\): The outcome that would be observed if individual \\(i\\) were exposed to the treatment. * \\(Y_i(0)\\): The outcome that would be observed if individual \\(i\\) were exposed to the control (no treatment).\nThis framework leads directly to what Holland (1986) termed the “fundamental problem of causal inference”: for any given individual, we can only ever observe one of these two potential outcomes. The outcome we do not see is the counterfactual. Causal inference can thus be viewed as a missing data problem, where the goal is to estimate the values of the unobserved potential outcomes.\nFrom this foundation, we can define several key causal quantities, or estimands:\n\nIndividual Treatment Effect (ITE): The effect for a single individual, defined as \\[\\tau_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0).\\] This is typically unobservable.\nAverage Treatment Effect (ATE): The average effect across the entire population, \\[\\tau_{ATE} = E[Y(1) - Y(0)].\\] This is often the primary estimand of interest for broad policy questions.\nAverage Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT): The average effect for those who actually received the treatment, \\[\\tau_{ATT} = E[Y(1) - Y(0) | Z=1].\\]\nConditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE): The average effect for a subpopulation defined by a set of covariates \\(X=x\\), \\[\\tau(x) = E[Y(1) - Y(0) | X=x].\\] Understanding the CATE allows for the exploration of treatment effect heterogeneity.\n\nTo estimate these causal estimands from observational data, we must rely on a set of critical, untestable assumptions that connect the observed data to the unobserved potential outcomes. These are known as identification assumptions.\n\nStable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA): This assumption has two parts. First, it assumes there is no interference between units, meaning one individual’s treatment status does not affect another’s outcome. Second, it assumes there are no hidden variations of the treatment; the treatment assigned to one individual is the same as the treatment assigned to any other.\nIgnorability (or Unconfoundedness): This is the most crucial assumption. It states that, conditional on a set of observed pre-treatment covariates \\(X\\), treatment assignment \\(Z\\) is independent of the potential outcomes: \\[(Y(0), Y(1)) \\perp Z | X\\]. In essence, it assumes that we have measured all the common causes of both treatment selection and the outcome. If this holds, then within any stratum defined by the covariates \\(X\\), the treatment assignment is “as-if” random.\nPositivity (or Overlap/Common Support): This assumption requires that for any set of covariate values \\(x\\) present in the population, there is a non-zero probability of being in either the treatment or the control group: \\(0 &lt; P(Z=1 | X=x) &lt; 1\\). This ensures that we can find both treated and control individuals with similar characteristics, making comparison meaningful and avoiding extrapolation to regions with no data.\n\nTo demonstrate the application of Bayesian methods to this challenge, we use the famous Lalonde dataset, a canonical benchmark in the causal inference literature. The dataset addresses a real-world policy question: evaluating the effectiveness of the National Supported Work (NSW) Demonstration, a federally funded job training program implemented in the US from 1975-1979. The program was designed to help individuals facing significant social and economic barriers (e.g., former drug addicts, ex-convicts, high school dropouts) improve their labor market prospects. The treatment (\\(treat\\)) is participation in this program, and the primary outcome (\\(re78\\)) is the individual’s real earnings in 1978, after the program.\nThe historical importance of this dataset stems from Robert Lalonde’s 1986 paper, which delivered a powerful critique of the non-experimental methods used at the time. Lalonde started with data from an actual RCT, which provided an unbiased estimate of the program’s effect. He then took the treated group from the experiment but replaced the experimental control group with a non-experimental comparison group drawn from large public surveys—the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the Current Population Survey (CPS). He showed that the standard econometric models of the era failed to replicate the experimental benchmark when applied to this new, confounded dataset, casting serious doubt on their reliability for policy evaluation. Our task is to see if a modern, flexible Bayesian method—Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART)—can succeed where these earlier methods failed.\nThe challenge posed by the Lalonde dataset becomes immediately apparent when we examine the pre-treatment characteristics of the treated group versus the non-experimental control group. A naive comparison of their 1978 earnings would be deeply misleading because the groups were profoundly different before the program even began. Table 16.1 illustrates this imbalance for key covariates, including age, education, race, marital status, and earnings in the years prior to the intervention (1974 and 1975).\nThe Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) provides a scale-free measure of the difference between the group means. A common rule of thumb suggests that an absolute SMD greater than 0.1 indicates a potentially meaningful imbalance. As the table shows, the groups differ substantially on nearly every measured characteristic. The treated individuals were younger, less educated, more likely to be from minority groups, and had drastically lower earnings in the years before the program. This severe selection bias is precisely what makes the Lalonde dataset such a difficult and important test case for causal inference methods. Any credible method must be able to adjust for these vast pre-existing differences to isolate the true causal effect of the job training program.\n\n\n\nTable 16.1: Covariate Balance in the Lalonde Non-Experimental Dataset. Note: Data corresponds to the widely used Dehejia and Wahba (1999) sample of the Lalonde dataset.

Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is a powerful non-parametric machine learning algorithm that is exceptionally well-suited for this task. It combines the predictive power of ensemble methods with a rigorous Bayesian framework for regularization and uncertainty quantification.\nAt its core, BART models the expected value of an outcome \\(Y\\) as a sum of many individual regression trees. For a set of predictors \\(x\\), the model is:\n\\[Y = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} g(x; T_j, M_j) + \\epsilon, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\]\nHere, \\(m\\) is the number of trees in the ensemble (typically around 200), and each function \\(g(x; T_j, M_j)\\) represents a single regression tree. The structure of the tree is denoted by \\(T_j\\), and \\(M_j\\) is the set of parameter values in its terminal nodes (or leaves).\nCrucially, each individual tree is designed to be a “weak learner”. It is kept shallow and simple, meaning it explains only a small fraction of the variation in the outcome. The final, powerful prediction comes from summing up the contributions of all these simple components. This sum-of-trees structure allows BART to automatically capture very complex relationships, including high-order interactions and non-linearities, without the user needing to specify them in advance. For example, an interaction between age and education is implicitly modeled if a tree splits on education within a branch that has already been split on age. This flexibility is a major advantage in observational studies where the true functional form of the relationship between the outcome and the confounders is unknown.\nIn most machine learning algorithms, overfitting is controlled through techniques like cross-validation or complexity penalties. BART, being a fully Bayesian method, achieves this through a carefully specified set of regularization priors. These priors are designed to keep each tree simple and prevent any single tree from dominating the overall fit.\nThe key priors are:\n\nPrior on Tree Structure: This prior strongly encourages shallow trees. It is defined by a rule governing the probability that a node at a certain depth \\(d\\) will be split further. This probability is typically modeled as \\[p(T_j) = \\alpha(1+d)^{-\\beta},\\] where \\(\\alpha \\in (0,1)\\) and \\(\\beta \\ge 0\\) are hyperparameters. Setting \\(\\beta\\) to a value like 2 ensures that the probability of splitting decreases rapidly with depth, keeping the trees small.\nPrior on Terminal Node Parameters: After the response variable \\(Y\\) is centered and scaled, the values \\(\\mu_{jk}\\) in the terminal nodes of each tree are given a Normal prior, \\[\n\\mu_{jk} \\sim N(0, \\sigma_{\\mu}^2).\n\\] This prior shrinks the predictions within each leaf towards zero. Because the final prediction is a sum over \\(m\\) trees, this shrinkage ensures that the contribution of each individual tree is small.\nPrior on Error Variance: The residual variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) is typically given a conjugate Inverse-Gamma prior. This prior is usually chosen to be weakly informative, allowing the data to dominate the posterior estimate of the noise level, but it still constrains the variance to be reasonable.\n\nTogether, these priors act as a sophisticated regularization mechanism that allows BART to fit complex functions while being highly resistant to overfitting.\nBART models are fit using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, specifically a form of Gibbs sampler known as Bayesian backfitting. The algorithm does not find a single “best” model. Instead, it generates thousands of samples from the joint posterior distribution of all model parameters: \\(p(T_1,\\ldots,T_m, M_1,\\ldots,M_m, \\sigma | Y, X)\\).\nThe fitting process works iteratively :\n\nInitialize all \\(m\\) trees and \\(\\sigma\\).\nFor each tree \\(j\\) from 1 to \\(m\\):\n\nCalculate the “partial residual” by subtracting the predictions of all other trees from the outcome: \\[R_j = Y - \\sum_{k \\neq j} g(x; T_k, M_k)\\].\nDraw a new tree structure \\(T_j\\) and its leaf parameters \\(M_j\\) from their posterior distribution conditional on this partial residual, \\[p(T_j, M_j | R_j, \\sigma).\\]\n\nAfter iterating through all trees, draw a new value for \\(\\sigma\\) from its posterior conditional on the current residuals.\nRepeat steps 2 and 3 for thousands of iterations.\n\nThe output of this process is not one set of trees, but a collection of (e.g., 5000) sets of trees, where each set represents a plausible regression function drawn from the posterior distribution. This collection of draws is the key to quantifying uncertainty in a Bayesian way.\nThe power of BART for causal inference lies in how it leverages the full posterior distribution to estimate counterfactuals. The strategy aligns perfectly with the Bayesian view of causal inference as a missing data problem, as articulated by Rubin (1978).\nThe standard approach for causal inference with BART is to model the outcome \\(Y\\) as a function of both the covariates \\(X\\) and the treatment indicator \\(Z\\). The model learns a single, flexible response surface:\n\\[E[Y | X, Z] = f(X, Z)\\]\nHere, the treatment \\(Z\\) is included as if it were “just another covariate” in the set of predictors fed to the BART algorithm. The model is free to discover how the effect of \\(Z\\) varies with \\(X\\) through the tree-splitting process. The Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) is then simply the difference in the predictions from this learned function:\n\\[\\tau(x) = f(x, Z=1) - f(x, Z=0)\\]\nThe core of the estimation process is a predictive step that is repeated for each draw from the MCMC sampler. Suppose the MCMC algorithm has produced \\(S\\) posterior draws of the function \\(f\\). For each draw \\(s = 1,\\ldots, S\\):\n\nWe take the full dataset of \\(n\\) individuals with their observed covariates \\(X\\).\nWe create two hypothetical, or counterfactual, datasets:\n\nTreated World: The observed covariates \\(X\\) for all \\(n\\) individuals, but with the treatment indicator set to \\(Z=1\\) for everyone.\nControl World: The observed covariates \\(X\\) for all \\(n\\) individuals, but with the treatment indicator set to \\(Z=0\\) for everyone.\n\nUsing the fitted BART model corresponding to posterior draw \\(s\\) (i.e., \\(f^{(s)}\\)), we predict the outcome for every individual under both scenarios. This gives us a full set of posterior predictive draws for the potential outcomes: \\(\\tilde{Y}_i(1)^{(s)}\\) and \\(\\tilde{Y}_i(0)^{(s)}\\) for each individual \\(i\\).\n\nThis process is a direct implementation of the missing data analogy. For an individual \\(i\\) who was actually treated (\\(Z_i=1\\)), their observed outcome \\(Y_i\\) is their potential outcome \\(Y_i(1)\\). The BART model provides a posterior predictive draw for their missing counterfactual outcome, \\(\\tilde{Y}_i(0)^{(s)}\\). Conversely, for a control subject, we use the model to predict their missing \\(\\tilde{Y}_i(1)^{(s)}\\).\nOnce we have the posterior draws of the potential outcomes for every individual at each MCMC iteration, we can compute a posterior draw for any causal estimand of interest. For example, at each iteration \\(s\\):\n\nITE draw: \\[\\tau_i^{(s)} = \\tilde{Y}_i(1)^{(s)} - \\tilde{Y}_i(0)^{(s)}\\]\nATE draw: \\[\\tau_{ATE}^{(s)} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\tau_i^{(s)}\\]\n\nBy collecting these values across all \\(S\\) MCMC iterations, we obtain \\[\\{\\tau_{ATE}^{(1)}, \\tau_{ATE}^{(2)},\\ldots, \\tau_{ATE}^{(S)}\\}.\\] This set is a Monte Carlo approximation of the entire posterior distribution of the Average Treatment Effect.\nThis is a profoundly powerful result. Instead of a single point estimate and a standard error, the Bayesian approach yields a full probability distribution for the unknown causal effect. From this posterior distribution, we can easily calculate a posterior mean (our best point estimate) and a 95% credible interval. Unlike a frequentist confidence interval, the Bayesian credible interval has a direct and intuitive probabilistic interpretation: given our data and model, there is a 95% probability that the true value of the ATE lies within this range. This propagation of uncertainty from the model parameters all the way to the final causal estimate is a hallmark of the Bayesian approach.\nWe now apply this framework to the Lalonde dataset to estimate the causal effect of the NSW job training program on 1978 earnings.\nThe analysis is streamlined by using the bartCause package in R, which is specifically designed for causal inference with BART. The package provides a wrapper around the core dbarts implementation, simplifying the process of fitting the model and generating counterfactuals. A typical function call would look like this:\n\n# Load the package and data\nlibrary(bartCause)\ndata(lalonde)\n\n# Define confounders\nconfounders &lt;- c('age', 'educ', 'black', 'hisp', 'married', 'nodegr', 're74', 're75')\n\n# Fit the BART model\nfit &lt;- bartc(\n  response = lalonde$re78,\n  treatment = lalonde$treat,\n  confounders = lalonde[, confounders],\n  estimand = \"ate\",\n  commonSup.rule = \"sd\" # Rule to handle poor overlap\n)\n\nIn this call, we specify the outcome (re78), the binary treatment (treat), and the matrix of pre-treatment confounders. We set estimand = ate to target the Average Treatment Effect\nBefore interpreting the causal estimates, it is essential to perform MCMC diagnostics to ensure the algorithm has converged to a stable posterior distribution. The bartCause package provides plotting functions for this purpose. Trace plots for key parameters, such as the posterior draws of the ATE and the residual standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)), should be examined. These plots should show the chains mixing well and exploring a consistent region of the parameter space, without long-term drifts or stuck periods, indicating that the sampler has converged.\nThe primary result can be obtained by calling summary(fit). This provides the posterior mean of the ATE, which serves as our point estimate, along with a 95% credible interval. For a richer view, we can plot the entire posterior distribution of the ATE, which visualizes our uncertainty about the treatment effect.\nThe true power of this result is seen when placed in the context of other estimates, as shown in Table 16.2. The naive difference in means between the treated and control groups in the non-experimental data is large and negative, a direct consequence of the severe confounding. The experimental benchmark from the original RCT for this subset of treated individuals is an earnings gain of approximately $886. The BART estimate, after adjusting for the observed confounders, is remarkably close to this benchmark. This result demonstrates that a flexible, non-parametric Bayesian model like BART can successfully overcome the severe selection bias that plagued earlier econometric methods, effectively “solving” the problem posed by\n\n\n\nTable 16.2: Comparison of ATE Estimates for the NSW Program. Note: Estimates are for the non-experimental Lalonde sample (treated units from NSW, control units from PSID). The experimental benchmark is the difference-in-means estimate from the randomized trial for the same treated units. Uncertainty for BART is the posterior standard deviation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nATE Estimate\nUncertainty (Std.

A policy might be beneficial on average but ineffective or even harmful for certain subgroups. A key advantage of BART is its ability to move beyond the average and explore this Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE), which is critical for developing more targeted and effective policies.\nEstimating HTE allows us to answer questions like: “For whom does this program work best?” or “Are there individuals for whom the program is detrimental?” In settings with limited resources, this information is vital for allocating the intervention to those most likely to benefit. The flexibility of BART, which does not assume a constant treatment effect, makes it an ideal tool for this task.\nBecause BART provides a posterior predictive distribution of potential outcomes for every individual in the dataset, we can estimate an Individual Conditional Average Treatment Effect (ICATE) for each person. By plotting a histogram of the posterior means of these ICATEs, we can visualize the distribution of effects across the sample. This reveals whether the effect is consistent for everyone or if there is substantial variation, with some individuals benefiting much more than others.\nTo understand what drives this heterogeneity, we can examine how the estimated CATE varies as a function of key pre-treatment covariates. These relationships are often visualized using partial dependence plots. For the Lalonde data, such analyses have revealed that the effect of the job training program is not constant but varies non-linearly with characteristics like age and pre-treatment income (re74). For instance, the program’s benefit might increase with age up to a certain point and then decline, or it might be most effective for individuals with low-to-moderate prior earnings but less so for those with very low or higher earnings. These are nuanced, data-driven insights that would be completely missed by a standard linear regression model that only estimates a single average effect.\nA subtle but important issue can arise when using flexible regularized models like BART for causal inference in the presence of strong confounding, as is the case here. The regularization priors, which are designed to prevent overfitting, can shrink the estimated effects of the confounders towards zero. Because the treatment Z is highly correlated with these confounders, the model may mistakenly attribute some of the effect of the confounders to the treatment, leading to a bias known as Regularization-Induced Confounding (RIC).\nA powerful solution, proposed by Hahn, Murray, and Carvalho (2020), is to first estimate the propensity score, \\(\\pi(x) = P(Z=1|X)\\), which is the probability of receiving treatment given the covariates X. This score serves as a one-dimensional summary of all confounding information. This estimated propensity score is then included as an additional predictor in the BART outcome model. By providing this confounding summary directly to the model, we help the BART algorithm differentiate between the prognostic effects of the covariates (captured by \\(\\pi(x)\\)) and the causal effect of the treatment Z, thereby mitigating RIC. This “ps-BART” approach is considered state-of-the-art and is easily implemented in the bartCause package by setting the argument p.scoreAsCovariate = TRUE\n\nBART versus Propensity Score Matching (PSM)\nBART is one of several methods for causal inference from observational data. It is instructive to compare its philosophy with that of another widely used technique: Propensity Score Matching (PSM). BART and PSM represent two different philosophies for tackling confounding. Propensity Score Matching (PSM): This approach focuses on the design of the study. The goal is to use the observed data to construct a new sample in which the treatment and control groups are balanced on their observed covariates, thereby mimicking the properties of an RCT. The propensity score is the central tool used to achieve this balance. The analysis of the outcome is then performed on this newly created, “balanced” dataset.\nBART focuses on the analysis stage. The goal is to build a highly flexible and accurate predictive model for the outcome that explicitly includes the treatment and confounders, \\(E[Y|X,Z]\\). It uses the full dataset and relies on the model’s ability to correctly adjust for the confounding variables to isolate the causal effect.\nEach approach has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. PSM is often praised for its transparency; one can assess the quality of the covariate balance achieved by the matching procedure before ever looking at the outcome variable, reducing the risk of “p-hacking” or specification searching. However, PSM can be inefficient, as it often requires discarding a significant portion of the control group that does not have good matches in the treated group (i.e., poor overlap). It can also suffer from residual confounding if the matches are not sufficiently close. BART, on the other hand, is highly efficient as it uses all available data. Its main strengths are its flexibility in capturing unknown functional forms and interactions, its ability to easily estimate heterogeneous effects, and its principled framework for uncertainty quantification. Its primary weakness is that it can be perceived as a “black box” if not diagnosed carefully. Its validity, like all modeling approaches, depends on the untestable ignorability assumption, and as discussed, it can be susceptible to regularization-induced confounding if not applied with care.\nIn modern practice, the line between these two philosophies is blurring. It is now common to see them used in conjunction. For example, many practitioners use flexible machine learning models, including BART itself, to estimate the propensity scores used for matching or weighting, which can improve the quality of the covariate balance over simpler logistic regression models. Conversely, the state-of-the-art application of BART for causal inference (ps-BART) incorporates the propensity score directly into the outcome model. This convergence reflects a mature understanding that both balancing the data structure and flexibly modeling the outcome are complementary and powerful tools for robust causal inference.\n\nConceptual Comparison of BART and Propensity Score Matching\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nPropensity Score Matching (PSM)\nBayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART)\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Goal\nCreate balanced treatment/control groups (Design)\nFlexibly model the outcome-covariate relationship (Analysis)\n\n\nUse of Data\nOften discards unmatched units, reducing sample size\nUses all available data\n\n\nConfounding Control\nAchieved by balancing covariates via matching/weighting\nAchieved by conditioning on covariates in a flexible model\n\n\nKey Assumption\nCorrect specification of the propensity score model\nCorrect specification of the outcome model (though BART is very flexible)\n\n\nTreatment Effect\nPrimarily estimates ATT; ATE can be harder to estimate\nEasily estimates ATE, ATT, and CATE/HTE\n\n\nUncertainty\nOften requires bootstrapping for standard errors\nProvides full posterior distributions and credible intervals naturally\n\n\nFlexibility\nLimited by the PS model; main effect is assumed constant after matching\nHighly flexible; automatically models non-linearities and interactions\n\n\n\nThis example shows that BART, a flexible non-parametric method, can successfully adjust for severe confounding and recover a causal estimate that is remarkably close to the experimental benchmark, a feat that eluded many of the methods available when Lalonde first published his critique. It is crucial to remember that BART is not a panacea. Its validity, like that of any non-experimental method, rests on the untestable assumption of ignorability—that we have measured and adjusted for all relevant confounding variables. However, given that assumption, BART offers a suite of powerful advantages that make it a top-tier method in the modern causal inference landscape, a status confirmed by its consistent high performance in data analysis competitions. For the Bayesian statistician, the key takeaways are threefold:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTakeaway\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nPhilosophical Coherence\nBART provides a method for causal inference that is deeply integrated with Bayesian principles. It seamlessly frames the estimation of causal effects as a posterior predictive imputation of missing potential outcomes, propagating all sources of parameter uncertainty into the final result.\n\n\nRobustness to Misspecification\nBy using a flexible sum-of-trees ensemble, BART avoids the need for strong parametric assumptions about the functional form of the relationship between the covariates and the outcome. This provides robust protection against model misspecification bias, which is a major concern in observational studies where these relationships are complex and unknown.\n\n\nRichness of Inference\nBART naturally yields a full posterior distribution for any causal estimand of interest. This allows for a more complete and intuitive quantification of uncertainty through credible intervals and facilitates the exploration of heterogeneous treatment effects, moving the analysis from a single average number to a nuanced understanding of for whom an intervention works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnikolopov, Ruben, Vasily Korovkin, Maria Petrova, Konstantin Sonin, and Alexei Zakharov. 2013. “Field Experiment Estimate of Electoral Fraud in Russian Parliamentary Elections.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 110 (2): 448–52.\n\n\nHahn, P.

    "text": "17.1 Fundamental Considerations in Model Selection\nIn the world of statistical modeling and machine learning, we face a fundamental challenge that echoes Sherlock Holmes’ famous words about eliminating the impossible to find the truth. When confronted with data, we must navigate through countless possible models, each representing a different hypothesis about the underlying relationships in our data. The art and science of model selection lies in systematically choosing the model that best captures the true signal while avoiding the trap of fitting noise.\nIn the next chapter (Chapter 18), we focus on regularization techniques, which can also be viewed as model selection mechanisms. Specifically, we discuss Ridge regression, LASSO, and their Bayesian interpretations. These methods offer elegant solutions to the overfitting problem by introducing penalties for model complexity, automatically balancing fit and parsimony. We saw how these frequentist approaches connect to Bayesian thinking through the lens of prior distributions and posterior inference.\nThis chapter explores the critical decisions involved in choosing the right model. We begin by examining the fundamental considerations that guide model selection: the bias-variance tradeoff, the challenges of overfitting and underfitting, and the practical constraints of computational resources and data quality. We’ll explore how the purpose of our analysis—whether prediction or interpretation—should influence our modeling choices, drawing on Leo Breiman’s influential distinction between the “two cultures” of statistical modeling.\nThe chapter then delves into practical methodologies for model evaluation and selection. We’ll cover exploratory data analysis techniques that help us understand our data before committing to a particular model form, followed by rigorous approaches to measuring out-of-sample performance through cross-validation and information criteria. These tools provide the foundation for making principled decisions about model complexity.\nBy the end of this chapter, you’ll have a comprehensive toolkit for approaching model selection problems, understanding when different techniques are appropriate, and implementing these methods in practice. Most importantly, you’ll develop the judgment to balance the competing demands of accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency that characterize real-world modeling challenges.\nWhen building predictive models, several important considerations guide our choices. Understanding these factors helps us make informed decisions about model complexity and selection.\nModel Complexity and Generalization: Choosing the right model for the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) involves navigating a fundamental trade-off between model complexity and generalization ability. If the chosen model is too simple (e.g., linear regression when the true relationship is polynomial), it might underfit the data and fail to capture important relationships, leading to high bias and poor performance on both training and test data. Conversely, a model that is too complex (e.g., high-degree polynomials or deep neural networks with insufficient data) might overfit the data by memorizing training examples rather than learning the underlying pattern, resulting in excellent training performance but poor generalization to unseen examples. This problem becomes even more complex when dealing with non-linear relationships, high-dimensional data, or noisy data, where the optimal model complexity is not immediately obvious and may require systematic experimentation with different model architectures, regularization techniques, and hyperparameter tuning to find the right balance between capturing the true signal while avoiding noise.\nOverfitting and Underfitting: Overfitting occurs when the model fits the training data too closely, capturing not only the true underlying relationship but also random noise and idiosyncrasies specific to the training dataset. This phenomenon typically manifests when a model has too many parameters relative to the amount of training data available, allowing it to essentially “memorize” the training examples rather than learning the generalizable patterns. The model may achieve excellent performance metrics on the training data (low training error) but will perform poorly on new, unseen data (high generalization error). This is because the model has learned to recognize specific noise patterns in the training data that don’t exist in the broader population. Common signs of overfitting include a large gap between training and validation/test performance, or performance that improves on training data while degrading on validation data during training iterations.\nUnderfitting occurs when the model is too simple and fails to capture the true relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), often due to insufficient model complexity or inadequate training. This can happen when using a model that is inherently too simple for the problem at hand (e.g., linear regression for a highly non-linear relationship), when the model hasn’t been trained for enough iterations, or when regularization is applied too aggressively. Underfitting results in poor performance on both training and test data, as the model lacks the capacity to learn the underlying patterns in the data. The model essentially misses important features or relationships that are necessary for accurate predictions. Unlike overfitting, underfitting typically shows similar poor performance across training, validation, and test sets, indicating that the model is not capturing the signal in the data regardless of the dataset.\nData Quality and Quantity: The accuracy of predictions heavily relies on the quality and quantity of the available data. If the data is noisy, inaccurate, or incomplete, it can lead to misleading predictions. A sufficient amount of data is also crucial to ensure the model can learn the underlying relationship effectively. Insufficient data can result in underfitting and poor generalization.\nData quality issues can manifest in various forms, including missing values, inconsistent formatting, labeling errors, and biased sampling. These problems are particularly acute in machine learning applications where large volumes of labeled data are required for training. To address these challenges, companies have emerged that specialize in data quality improvement and annotation services.\nCompanies like Scale AI and Toloka provide platforms that help organizations improve data quality through human-in-the-loop annotation and validation processes. These platforms employ large networks of human annotators who can perform tasks such as image labeling, text classification, data validation, and quality control. Scale AI, for example, offers services for creating high-quality training datasets through human annotation, with built-in quality control mechanisms that include multiple annotators per task and consensus-based validation. Their platform can handle various data types including images, text, and video, making it suitable for computer vision, natural language processing, and other AI applications.\nToloka, similarly, provides a crowdsourcing platform that connects businesses with a global network of contributors who can perform data labeling, content moderation, and quality assessment tasks. Their platform includes quality control features such as skill-based routing, where tasks are assigned to annotators based on their demonstrated expertise, and dynamic overlap, where multiple workers verify the same data to ensure accuracy.\nThese platforms help address several key data quality challenges: they can identify and correct labeling errors through consensus mechanisms, handle missing data through targeted collection efforts, and ensure consistency in data formatting and annotation standards. By leveraging human expertise at scale, these services enable organizations to create more reliable training datasets, which in turn leads to better-performing machine learning models and more accurate predictions.\nModel Explainability: In many applications, it is crucial to understand how the model arrives at its predictions. This is particularly important in areas like healthcare or finance, where transparency and interpretability are essential. Some models, particularly complex ones like deep neural networks, can be difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand the rationale behind their predictions. However, modern machine learning has developed several techniques to address this challenge and make complex models more interpretable.\nThe importance of explainability extends beyond mere curiosity about model behavior. In healthcare applications, doctors need to understand why a model recommended a particular diagnosis or treatment plan to make informed decisions and maintain trust in the system. A model that predicts a patient has a 90% chance of having cancer but cannot explain which symptoms or test results led to this conclusion would be of limited clinical value. Similarly, in financial services, regulators require explanations for credit decisions to ensure compliance with fair lending laws and to prevent discriminatory practices. When a loan application is denied, both the applicant and regulatory bodies need to understand the specific factors that influenced this decision.\nIn legal and compliance contexts, explainability becomes a legal requirement. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) includes a “right to explanation” that allows individuals to request information about automated decisions that affect them. This has created a legal imperative for organizations to develop explainable AI systems. In criminal justice applications, where AI systems might be used for risk assessment or sentencing recommendations, the stakes are particularly high. Judges, lawyers, and defendants all need to understand how these systems arrive at their conclusions to ensure fair and just outcomes.\nOne prominent approach is the use of interpretable surrogate models, such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). These methods work by approximating the complex model’s behavior in the vicinity of a specific prediction using simpler, more interpretable models like linear regression or decision trees. LIME, for instance, creates local explanations by sampling points around the prediction of interest and fitting a linear model to explain the model’s behavior in that neighborhood. This allows us to understand which features contributed most to a particular prediction, even for complex models like deep neural networks.\nAnother powerful technique is attention mechanisms, which have become increasingly popular in natural language processing and computer vision. Attention mechanisms allow models to “focus” on specific parts of the input when making predictions, providing a form of built-in interpretability. For example, in image classification tasks, attention maps can highlight which regions of an image the model is focusing on when making its prediction, making it easier to understand the model’s decision-making process.\nGradient-based methods offer another approach to model interpretability. Techniques like Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) use gradients to identify which parts of the input are most important for the model’s prediction. By computing the gradient of the model’s output with respect to the input features, these methods can create heatmaps that show which features or regions contributed most to the final prediction.\nFor tree-based models like random forests and gradient boosting machines, built-in feature importance measures provide natural interpretability. These methods can rank features based on their contribution to the model’s predictive performance, offering insights into which variables are most important for making predictions.\nModel distillation techniques represent another approach, where a complex model (the teacher) is used to train a simpler, more interpretable model (the student) that mimics the teacher’s behavior. The student model, being simpler, is easier to interpret while maintaining much of the teacher’s predictive performance.\nFinally, counterfactual explanations provide a different type of interpretability by showing what changes to the input would be needed to change the model’s prediction. For example, if a loan application is rejected, a counterfactual explanation might show that the application would have been approved if the applicant’s income were $10,000 higher or if their credit score were 50 points better.\nThese modern interpretability techniques have made it possible to understand and explain the behavior of even the most complex models, addressing the “black box” problem that has historically limited the adoption of advanced machine learning methods in critical applications where transparency is essential.\nComputational Cost: Training and using prediction models can be computationally expensive, especially for complex models with large datasets. This can limit their applicability in resource-constrained environments. Finding a balance between model complexity, accuracy, and computational cost is critical for practical applications.\nThe computational demands of machine learning models have been significantly addressed through the development of specialized hardware, particularly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Originally designed for rendering graphics in video games, GPUs have become essential for deep learning due to their parallel processing architecture. Unlike traditional Central Processing Units (CPUs) that process tasks sequentially, GPUs can perform thousands of mathematical operations simultaneously, making them ideal for the matrix multiplications and tensor operations that are fundamental to neural network training. This parallel processing capability has reduced training times from weeks to hours or even minutes for many deep learning models, democratizing access to advanced machine learning techniques.\nHowever, the computational cost challenge extends beyond just training to the deployment phase, where models need to run efficiently in production environments. This has led to the emergence of edge computing as a crucial solution. Edge computing involves processing data and running models closer to where the data is generated, rather than sending everything to centralized cloud servers. This approach offers several advantages for machine learning applications: reduced latency for real-time predictions, lower bandwidth costs by processing data locally, and improved privacy by keeping sensitive data on local devices.\nEdge computing is particularly important for applications requiring real-time decision making, such as autonomous vehicles, industrial IoT systems, and mobile applications. For example, a self-driving car cannot afford the latency of sending sensor data to a cloud server and waiting for predictions to return; it needs to process information and make decisions locally within milliseconds. Similarly, smart manufacturing systems use edge computing to monitor equipment and predict maintenance needs in real-time without the delays associated with cloud processing.\nQuantization and lower precision calculations have emerged as powerful techniques for reducing computational costs while maintaining model performance. Traditional neural networks use 32-bit floating-point numbers (FP32) for all calculations, which provides high precision but requires significant computational resources and memory. Quantization reduces the precision of these numbers, typically to 16-bit (FP16), 8-bit integers (INT8), or even 4-bit integers (INT4), dramatically reducing both memory usage and computational requirements. For example, converting from FP32 to INT8 can reduce memory usage by 75% and computational cost by 2-4x, while often maintaining acceptable accuracy levels. This is particularly valuable for deployment on edge devices with limited resources, such as smartphones, IoT devices, and embedded systems. Modern hardware, including specialized AI accelerators like Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and NVIDIA’s Tensor Cores, are specifically designed to handle these lower precision calculations efficiently, further reducing the computational cost barrier.\nThe trade-offs between computational cost and model performance are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Techniques like model pruning, which removes unnecessary connections from neural networks, can create smaller, faster models. Knowledge distillation allows large, complex models to transfer their knowledge to smaller, more efficient models that can run on resource-constrained devices.\nThese developments have created a spectrum of deployment options, from powerful cloud-based systems that can run the most complex models to lightweight edge devices that can perform basic predictions locally. The choice depends on the specific requirements of the application, including latency requirements, accuracy needs, privacy concerns, and cost constraints. As hardware continues to improve and optimization techniques become more sophisticated, the computational cost barrier to deploying machine learning models continues to decrease, opening up new possibilities for AI applications in previously inaccessible domains.\nEthical Considerations: Predictions can have significant real-world consequences, raising ethical concerns about bias, fairness, and potential misuse. It is crucial to consider the potential harms and unintended consequences of predictions and implement safeguards to mitigate them.\nThe ethical implications of predictive models have become increasingly prominent as these systems are deployed in critical domains such as healthcare, criminal justice, employment, and financial services. One of the most significant concerns is algorithmic bias, which can perpetuate or amplify existing societal inequalities. For example, facial recognition systems have been shown to have higher error rates for people of color, potentially leading to wrongful arrests or surveillance. Similarly, hiring algorithms trained on historical data may perpetuate gender or racial biases present in past hiring decisions, creating a feedback loop that reinforces discrimination.\nFairness in machine learning has emerged as a critical research area, with multiple definitions and approaches to ensure equitable treatment across different demographic groups. Statistical parity, equalized odds, and individual fairness are among the various fairness metrics that can be applied depending on the specific context and requirements of the application. However, achieving fairness often involves trade-offs with model accuracy, and different fairness definitions may conflict with each other, requiring careful consideration of which definition is most appropriate for a given use case.\nThe potential for misuse of predictive models is another significant concern. Models designed for legitimate purposes can be repurposed for harmful applications, such as using facial recognition for mass surveillance or employing predictive policing algorithms that disproportionately target certain communities. Additionally, the increasing sophistication of deepfake technology, which uses predictive models to generate realistic but fake images, videos, or audio, raises concerns about misinformation and manipulation.\nPrivacy concerns arise when predictive models require access to sensitive personal data. The collection, storage, and processing of personal information for training and deploying these models can violate individual privacy rights and create risks of data breaches. Differential privacy techniques, which add carefully calibrated noise to data or model outputs, have emerged as a promising approach to protect individual privacy while maintaining model utility.\nTransparency and accountability are essential for addressing ethical concerns. Organizations deploying predictive models must be able to explain their decisions and be held accountable for any harms that result. This includes maintaining audit trails, implementing human oversight mechanisms, and establishing clear procedures for addressing complaints or errors. The concept of “algorithmic impact assessments” has been proposed as a framework for evaluating the potential social impacts of automated decision-making systems before deployment.\nRegulatory frameworks are evolving to address these ethical challenges. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) includes provisions for automated decision-making and profiling, while various jurisdictions are developing specific regulations for AI systems. These regulations often require transparency, human oversight, and the ability to contest automated decisions.\nTechnical approaches to addressing ethical concerns include adversarial training to reduce bias, interpretability techniques to increase transparency, and robust testing procedures to identify potential harms before deployment. Regular monitoring and updating of deployed models is also crucial, as societal norms and legal requirements evolve over time.\nAddressing these challenges requires careful consideration of the specific problem, selection of appropriate techniques, and continuous evaluation and improvement of the prediction model. It also requires collaboration between technical experts, domain specialists, ethicists, and stakeholders to ensure that predictive models serve the public good while minimizing potential harms.",

    "section": "17.2 Prediction vs Interpretation",
    "text": "17.2 Prediction vs Interpretation\nPredictive models can serve two distinct purposes: prediction and interpretation. While these goals are not mutually exclusive, they often conflict with each other. The goal of interpretation is to understand the relationship between the input and output variables, which typically requires simpler, more transparent models.\nA model that excels at prediction might not be suitable for interpretation. For example, a complex deep neural network might achieve high predictive accuracy but provide little insight into how the input variables influence the output. Conversely, a simple linear model might be highly interpretable but lack the flexibility to capture complex relationships in the data. A key advantage of linear models is their ability to serve both purposes effectively, unlike more complex models with many parameters that can be difficult to interpret.\nInterpretation problems typically require simpler models. We prioritize models that are easy to interpret and explain, even if they have slightly lower predictive accuracy. The evaluation metrics also differ: for interpretation, we typically use the coefficient of determination (R-squared) or p-values, which provide insights into the model’s fit and the statistical significance of the estimated relationships.\nThe choice between using a model for prediction or interpretation depends on the specific task and desired outcome. If the primary goal is accurate predictions, a complex model with high predictive accuracy might be preferred, even if it is less interpretable. However, if understanding the underlying relationships and causal mechanisms is crucial, a simpler and more interpretable model might be chosen, even if it has slightly lower predictive accuracy. Interpretive models are commonly used in scientific research, social sciences, and other fields where understanding the underlying causes and relationships is crucial.\nIn practice, it’s often beneficial to consider both prediction and interpretation when building and evaluating models. However, it is not unusual to build two different models, one for prediction and one for interpretation. This allows for a more nuanced analysis of the data and can lead to better insights than using a single model for both purposes.\n\nBreiman’s Two Cultures\nLet \\(x\\) be a high-dimensional input containing a large set of potentially relevant data, and let \\(y\\) represent an output (or response) to a task that we aim to solve based on the information in \\(x\\). Breiman [2000] summarizes the difference between statistical and machine learning philosophy as follows:\n\n“There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown.”\n\n\n“The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems.”\n\n\n“Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.”\n\nThis distinction highlights the fundamental difference between the traditional statistical approach, which assumes a specific data-generating process, and the machine learning approach, which focuses on finding patterns in data without making strong assumptions about the underlying mechanism.\nStatistical prediction problems are of great practical and theoretical interest. Deep learning predictors offer several advantages over traditional predictors:\n\nInput data can include all data of possible relevance to the prediction problem at hand\nNonlinearities and complex interactions among input data are accounted for seamlessly\nOverfitting is more easily avoided than with traditional high-dimensional procedures\nFast, scalable computational frameworks (such as TensorFlow) are available\n\nTree-based models and deep learning models exemplify the “algorithmic culture” that Breiman describes. These models can capture complex, non-linear relationships in data without requiring explicit specification of the functional form. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of interpretability. While decision trees offer some interpretability through their hierarchical structure, deep neural networks are often considered “black boxes” due to their complex, multi-layered architecture.\nThe trade-off between interpretability and accuracy is a central theme in modern machine learning. Simple models like linear regression are highly interpretable but may lack the flexibility to capture complex patterns. Complex models like deep neural networks can achieve high accuracy but are difficult to interpret. This has led to the development of various techniques for making complex models more interpretable, including feature importance measures, attention mechanisms, and surrogate models that approximate the behavior of complex models with simpler, more interpretable ones.",

    "section": "17.3 What Makes a Good Predictive Model?",
    "text": "17.3 What Makes a Good Predictive Model?\nWhat makes a good model? If the goal is prediction, then the model is as good as its predictions. The easiest way to visualize the quality of predictions is to plot \\(y\\) versus \\(\\hat{y}\\). Most of the time we use empirical assessment of model quality. However, sometimes theoretical bounds can be derived for a model that describe its accuracy. For example, in the case of the linear regression model, the prediction interval is defined by \\[\n\\hat{y} \\pm s\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{(x-\\bar{x})^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}}\n\\] where \\(s\\) is the standard deviation of the residuals. The prediction interval is the confidence interval for the prediction. The prediction interval is wider than the confidence interval because it includes the uncertainty in the prediction.\nAssume we have a predictive model \\[\ny = f(x) + \\epsilon\n\\] and we have some modeling assumption regarding the distribution of \\(\\epsilon\\). For example, when we use linear regression or BART, we assume that \\(\\epsilon\\) follows a normal distribution. One simple approach to test if observed samples \\(\\epsilon_1,\\ldots,\\epsilon_n\\) follow a specific distribution is to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).\nThe most common tools for exploratory data analysis are Q-Q plots, scatter plots, and bar plots/histograms.\nA Q-Q plot compares the quantiles of your data with the quantiles of a theoretical distribution (like normal, exponential, etc.). A quantile is the fraction (or percent) of points below the given value. That is, the \\(i\\)-th quantile is the point \\(x\\) for which \\(i\\)% of the data lies below \\(x\\). On a Q-Q plot, if the two datasets come from a population with the same distribution, we should see the points forming a line that’s roughly straight. More precisely, if the two datasets \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) come from the same distribution, then the points \\((x_{(i)}, y_{(i)})\\) should lie roughly on the line \\(y = x\\). If \\(y\\) comes from a distribution that’s linear in \\(x\\), then the points \\((x_{(i)}, y_{(i)})\\) should lie roughly on a line, but not necessarily on the line \\(y = x\\).\n\nExample 17.1 (Normal Q-Q plot) Figure 17.1 shows the normal Q-Q plot for the Data on birth weights of babies born in a Brisbane hospital on December 18, 1997. The data set contains 44 records.

    "section": "17.4 Out-of-Sample Performance",
    "text": "17.4 Out-of-Sample Performance\nA parametric model that we choose to fit to data is selected from a family of functions. We then use optimization to find the best model from that family by either minimizing empirical loss or maximizing the likelihood. Finding an appropriate family of functions is a major problem called the model selection problem. For example, the choice of input variables to be included in the model is part of the model selection process. Model selection involves determining which predictors, interactions, or transformations should be included in the model to achieve the best balance between complexity and predictive accuracy. In practice, we often encounter several models for the same dataset that perform nearly identically, making the selection process challenging.\nIt is important to note that a good model is not necessarily the one that fits the data perfectly. Overfitting can occur when a model is overly complex, capturing noise rather than the underlying pattern. A good model strikes a balance between fitting the data well and maintaining simplicity to ensure generalizability to new, unseen data. For instance, including too many parameters can lead to a perfect fit when the number of observations equals the number of parameters, but such a model is unlikely to perform well on out-of-sample data.\nThe goal of model selection is not only to achieve a good fit but also to reduce complexity by excluding unnecessary parameters. This process typically involves selecting a model from a relevant class of functions while keeping in mind the trade-offs between bias, variance, and model complexity. Techniques such as cross-validation, information criteria (e.g., AIC, BIC), and regularization methods are commonly used to guide the model selection process.\nThe model selection task is sometimes one of the most time-consuming parts of data analysis. Unfortunately, there is no single rule to find the best model. One way to think about the model choice problem is as yet another optimization problem, with the goal of finding the best family of functions that describe the data. With a small number of predictors, we can use brute force (check all possible models). For example, with \\(p\\) predictors there are \\(2^p\\) possible models with no interactions. Thus, the number of potential function families is huge even for modest values of \\(p\\). One cannot consider all transformations and interactions.\nOur goal is to build a model that predicts well for out-of-sample data, i.e., data that was not used for training. Ultimately, we are interested in using our models for prediction, and thus out-of-sample performance is the most important metric and should be used to choose the final model. In-sample performance is of little interest when choosing a predictive model, as one of the winners of the Netflix prize put it: “It’s like predicting how much someone will like a movie, having them watch it and tell you how much they really liked it.” Out-of-sample performance is the final judge of the quality of our model. The goal is to use data to find a pattern that we can exploit. The pattern will be “statistical” in nature. To uncover the pattern, we start with a training dataset, denoted by \\[\nD = (y_i,x_i)_{i=1}^n\n\\] and to test the validity of our model, we use an out-of-sample testing dataset \\[\nD^* = (y_j^*, x_j^*)_{j=1}^m,\n\\] where \\(x_i\\) is a set of \\(p\\) predictors and \\(y_i\\) is the response variable.\nA good predictor will “generalize” well and provide low MSE out-of-sample. There are a number of methods/objective functions that we will use to find \\(\\hat{f}\\). In a parameter-based approach, we will find a black box. There are a number of ways to build our black box model. Our goal is to find the map \\(f\\) that approximates the process that generated the data. For example, data could represent some physical observations, and our goal is to recover the “laws of nature” that led to those observations. One of the pitfalls is to find a map \\(f\\) that does not generalize. Generalization means that our model actually learned the “laws of nature” and not just identified patterns present in training. The lack of generalization of the model is called overfitting. It can be demonstrated in one dimension by remembering the fact from calculus that any set of \\(n\\) points can be approximated by a polynomial of degree \\(n\\), e.g., we can always draw a line that connects two points. Thus, in one dimension we can always find a function with zero empirical risk. However, such a function is unlikely to generalize to observations that were not in our training data. In other words, the empirical risk measure for \\(D^*\\) is likely to be very high. Let us illustrate that in-sample fit can be deceiving.\n\nExample 17.2 (Hard Function) Say we want to approximate the following function \\[\nf(x) = \\dfrac{1}{1+25x^2}.\n\\] This function is simply a ratio of two polynomial functions and we will try to build a linear model to reconstruct this function\n\nx = seq(-2,2,by=0.01)\ny = 1/(1+25*x^2)\n# Approximate with polynomial of degree 1 and 2\nm1 = lm(y~x)\nm2 = lm(y~poly(x,2))\n# Approximate with polynomial of degree 20 and 5\nm20 = lm(y~poly(x,20))\nm5 = lm(y~poly(x,5))\nx = seq(-3,3,by=0.01)\ny = 1/(1+25*x^2)\nplot(x,y,type='l',col='black',lwd=2)\nlines(x,predict(m1,list(x=x)),lwd=2, col=1)\nlines(x,predict(m2,poly(x,2)),lwd=2, col=2)\nlines(x,predict(m5,poly(x,5)),lwd=2, col=3)\nlines(x,predict(m20,poly(x,20)),lwd=2, col=4)\nlegend(\"topright\", legend=c(\"f(x)\",\"m1\",\"m2\",\"m5\",\"m20\"), col=c(\"black\",1:4), lty=1, cex=0.8, bty='n')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.2: Runge-Kutta function\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.2 shows the function itself (black line) on the interval \\([-3,3]\\). We used observations of \\(x\\) from the interval \\([-2,2]\\) to train the data (solid line) and from \\([-3,-2) \\cup (2,3]\\) (dotted line) to test the model and measure the out-of-sample performance. We tried four different linear functions to capture the relations. We see that linear model \\(\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\) is not a good model. However, as we increase the degree of the polynomial to 20, the resulting model \\(\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x + \\beta_2 x^2 +\\ldots+\\beta_{20}x^{20}\\) does fit the training dataset quite well, but does a very poor job on the test dataset. Thus, while in-sample performance is good, the out-of-sample performance is unsatisfactory. We should not use the degree 20 polynomial function as a predictive model. In practice, in-sample loss or classification rates provide us with a metric for comparing different predictors. It is worth mentioning here that there should be a penalty for overly complex rules that fit extremely well in-sample but perform poorly on out-of-sample data. As Einstein famously said, “A model should be simple, but not simpler.”\n\nTo a Bayesian, the solution to these decision problems are rather obvious: compute posterior distributions, and then make decisions by maximizing expected utility, where the posterior distribution is used to calculate the expectations. Classical solutions to these problems are different, and use repeated sampling ideas, whereby the performance of a decision rule is judged on its performance if the same decision problem were repeated infinitely. Thus, the decisions are made based on their population properties. One of the main uses of statistical decision theory is to compare different estimators or hypothesis testing procedures. This theory generates many important findings, most notably that many of the common classical estimators are “bad”,in some sense, and that Bayesian estimators are always “good”.\nThese results have major implications for empirical work and practical applications, as they provide a guide for forecasting.",

    "text": "17.5 Bias-Variance Trade-off\nFor any predictive model, we seek to achieve the best possible results, i.e., the smallest MSE or misclassification rate. However, model performance can vary depending on the specific training/validation split used. A model that performed well on one test set may not produce good results given additional data. Sometimes we observe situations where a small change in the data leads to a large change in the final estimated model, e.g., the parameters of the model. These results exemplify the bias/variance tradeoff, where increasing model bias can reduce variance in the final results. Similarly, low bias can result in high variance, but can also produce an oversimplification of the final model. The bias/variance concept is depicted below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.3: Bias-variance trade-off\n\n\n\n\nExample 17.3 (Bias-variance) We demonstrate bias-variance concept using Boston housing example.

For each polynomial \\(f\\) we averaged MSE from each of the ten models.\nFigure 17.4 (a) shows bias and variance for our twelve different models. As expected, bias increases while variance decreases as model complexity grows. On the other hand out-of-sample MSE is a U-shaped curve. The optimal model is the one that has smallest out-of-sample MSE.

We are interested in the decomposition of the error \\(\\E{(y-\\hat{y})^2}\\) as a function of bias \\(\\E{y-\\hat{y}}\\) and variance \\(\\Var{\\hat{y}}\\).\nHere \\(\\hat{y} = \\hat{f}_{\\beta}(x)\\) is the prediction from the model, and \\(y = f(x) + \\epsilon\\) is the true value, which is measured with noise \\(\\Var{\\epsilon} = \\sigma^2\\), where \\(f(x)\\) is the true unknown function. The expectation above measures the squared error of our model on a random sample \\(x\\). \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\E{(y - \\hat{y})^2}\n& = \\E{y^2 + \\hat{y}^2 - 2 y\\hat{y}} \\\\\n& = \\E{y^2} + \\E{\\hat{y}^2} - \\E{2y\\hat{y}} \\\\\n& = \\Var{y} + \\E{y}^2 + \\Var{\\hat{y}} + \\E{\\hat{y}}^2 - 2f\\E{\\hat{y}} \\\\\n& = \\Var{y} + \\Var{\\hat{y}} + (f^2 - 2f\\E{\\hat{y}} + \\E{\\hat{y}}^2) \\\\\n& = \\Var{y} + \\Var{\\hat{y}} + (f - \\E{\\hat{y}})^2 \\\\\n& = \\sigma^2 + \\Var{\\hat{y}} + \\mathrm{Bias}(\\hat{y})^2\\end{aligned}\n\\] Here we used the following identity: \\(\\Var{X} = \\E{X^2} - \\E{X}^2\\) and the fact that \\(f\\) is deterministic and \\(\\E{\\epsilon} = 0\\), thus \\(\\E{y} = \\E{f(x)+\\epsilon} = f + \\E{\\epsilon} = f\\).",

    "text": "17.6 Cross-Validation\nIf the dataset at hand is small and we cannot dedicate a large enough sample size for testing, simply measuring error on a test dataset can lead to wrong conclusions. When the size of the testing set \\(D^*\\) is small, the estimated out-of-sample performance has high variance, depending on precisely which observations are included in the test set. On the other hand, when the training set \\(D^*\\) is a large fraction of the entire sample available, the estimated out-of-sample performance will be underestimated. Why?\nA simple solution is to perform the training/testing split randomly several times and then use the average out-of-sample errors. This procedure has two parameters: the fraction of samples to be selected for testing \\(p\\) and the number of estimates to be performed \\(K\\). The resulting algorithm is as follows:\nfsz = as.integer(p*n)\nerror = rep(0,K)\nfor (k in 1:K)\n{\n    test_ind = sample(1:n,size = fsz)\n    training = d[-test_ind,]\n    testing = d[test_ind,]\n    m = lm(y~x, data=training)\n    yhat = predict(m,newdata = testing)\n    error[k] = mean((yhat-testing$y)^2)\n}\nres = mean(error)\nFigure 17.5 shows the process of splitting the dataset randomly five times.\nCross-validation modifies the random splitting approach to use a more “disciplined” way to split the dataset for training and testing. Instead of randomly selecting training data points, CV chooses consecutive observations, and thus each data point is used once for testing. Like the random approach, CV helps address the high variance issue of out-of-sample performance estimation when the available dataset is small.

While, both cross-validation and bootstrap approaches lead to better estimates, they require model to be fitted 5 times, which can be computationally costly for a complex model. On the other hand, estimate from cross-validation is of lower variance and less bias compared to the bootstrap estimate. Thus, we should prefer cross-validation.",

    "text": "17.7 Bayesian Model Selection\nThe probabilistic models of interest are the joint probability distribution \\(p(D,\\theta)\\) (called a generative model) and \\(P(Y,\\theta \\mid X)\\) (discriminative model). Discriminative models are easier to build and are more frequently used in practice. Generative models require modeling a distribution over the set of observed variables, which makes our model more complicated. Text analysis provides an illustrative example. The task of identifying the topic of an article can be solved using a discriminative distribution. The problem of generating a new article requires a generative model.\nLet \\(D\\) denote data. Let \\(\\theta_M \\in \\Theta_M\\) denote a set of parameters under model \\(M \\in \\mathcal{M}\\). Let \\(\\theta_M = (\\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_M)\\) be the \\(p\\)-vector of parameters. The Bayesian approach is straightforward: implement the Bayesian paradigm by executing Bayes’ rule. This requires the laws of probability and not optimization techniques. The notion of model complexity is no different. Let \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) denote the space of models and \\(\\theta\\) be the parameter vector. The Bayesian paradigm simply places probabilities over parameters and models given the data, namely \\(p(\\theta_M, M \\mid y)\\), where \\(y = (y_1, \\ldots, y_n)\\).\nThis has a number of decompositions. Bayes’ theorem calculates the joint posterior over parameters and models given data \\(D\\), namely \\[\n    P(\\theta_M,M\\mid D) = P(\\theta_M \\mid M,D)P(M\\mid D).\n\\] Notice how this factors the posterior into two terms: the conditional posterior over parameters given the model and the posterior over models given data.\nThe key quantity is the weight of evidence (a.k.a. marginal distribution of the data \\(D\\) given the model \\(M\\)), defined by \\[\np(D \\mid M) = \\int_{\\Theta_M} p(D \\mid \\theta_M, M) p(\\theta_M \\mid M) d\\theta_M.\n\\] Here \\(p(D \\mid \\theta_M, M)\\) is the traditional likelihood function. The key conditional distribution, however, is the specification of the prior over parameters \\(p(\\theta_M \\mid M)\\). As this is used in the marginalization, it can affect the Bayes risk dramatically. Occam’s razor comes from the fact that this marginalization provides a weight of evidence that favors simpler models over more complex ones.\nThis leads to a posterior over models, which is calculated as: \\[\\begin{align*}\n    P(M\\mid D)  & = \\dfrac{P(D\\mid M)P(M)}{P(D)}, \\\\\n    P(D\\mid M ) & = \\int_{ \\Theta_M} P(D\\mid \\theta_M , M ) p( \\theta_M | M ) d \\theta_M.\n\\end{align*}\\] Notice that this requires a joint prior specification \\(p(\\theta_M, M) = p(\\theta_M | M)p(M)\\) over parameters and models. The quantity \\(p(M| D)\\) is the marginal posterior for model complexity given the data. There is an equivalent posterior \\(p(\\theta_M | D)\\) for the parameters. \\(p(D \\mid M)\\) is the evidence of the data \\(D\\) given the complexity (a.k.a. conditional likelihood). The full evidence is \\[\np( D ) = \\int p( D| M ) p(M) d M.\n\\] This has been used to select the amount of hyperparameter regularization; see, for example, MacKay (1992).\nWe will see that the prior \\(p(\\theta_M | M)\\) will lead to an Occam’s razor effect, namely that the marginal distribution will favor simpler models. Importantly, this Occam’s razor effect is not in conflict with the Bayesian double descent phenomenon, which emerges from the marginal posterior of models given data and the conditional prior specification \\(p(\\theta_M | M)\\).\n\nExample 17.5 (Dice Example) Let’s consider a simple example of throwing a dice. Say, there are three dice, one that has numbers 1 through 6 (regular dice), one with three sides with ones and three sides with 2s (dice 1-2), one with three sides with ones and three sides with 2s and three sides with 3s (dice 1-2-3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDice 1-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDice 1-2-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular Dice\n\n\n\n\n\nYou observe outcome of one dice throw and it is 3. Which dice is it?\nTwo out of three explanations are plausible (dice 1-2-3 and regular dice). Intuitively, the 1-2-3 dice is more likely to produce 3 than the regular dice. Thus, if we need to choose, we would choose the 1-2-3 dice. For the sake of completeness, we can use the Bayes rule to calculate the evidence for each model.\nUsing Bayes’ rule: \\[P(M_i | D) = \\frac{P(D | M_i) P(M_i)}{P(D)}\\]\nwhere \\(M_i\\) represents each dice model and \\(D\\) is the observed data (outcome = 3).\nWe set equal prior probabilities for each dice: \\[P(M_1) = P(M_2) = P(M_3) = \\frac{1}{3}.\\] Now, we calculate the likelihood for each model.\n\n\n\nDice Type\nProbability of Rolling a 3\n\n\n\n\nRegular dice (\\(M_1\\))\n\\(P(3 | M_1) = 1/6\\)\n\n\nDice 1-2 (\\(M_2\\))\n\\(P(3 | M_2) = 0\\)\n\n\nDice 1-2-3 (\\(M_3\\))\n\\(P(3 | M_3) = \\frac{1}{3}\\)\n\n\n\nThen, the marginal likelihood is: \\[\nP(D) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} P(D | M_i) P(M_i) = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + 0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{6}.\n\\]\nFinally, posterior probabilities are\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDice Type\nPosterior Probability\n\n\n\n\nRegular dice\n\\(P(M_1 | D) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{1}{6}}=1/3\\)\n\n\nDice 1-2\n\\(P(M_2 | D) = \\frac{0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{1}{6}}=0\\)\n\n\nDice 1-2-3\n\\(P(M_3 | D) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{1}{6}}=2/3\\)\n\n\n\nGiven the observation of outcome 3, the dice 1-2-3 is twice as likely as the regular dice. The dice 1-2 is completely ruled out since it cannot produce a 3. This demonstrates how Bayesian model selection naturally eliminates impossible explanations and provides relative evidence for competing hypotheses.\n\nThis example demonstrates how the Bayesian paradigm provides a coherent framework to simultaneously infer parameters and model complexity. The fact that Bayesian approach selects the most probable model that explains the observed data, is called the automatic Occam’s razor. The Occam’s razor is a principle that states that the simplest explanation is the best explanation.\nWhile performing data analysis using learning algorithms, we perform two tasks, namely training and inference which are summarized in the table below\n\n\n\nStep\nGiven\nHidden\nWhat to find\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\\(D = (X,Y) = \\{x_i,y_i\\}_{i=1}^n\\)\n\\(\\theta\\)\n\\(p(\\theta \\mid D)\\)\n\n\nPrediction\n\\(x_{\\text{new}}\\)\n\\(y_{\\text{new}}\\)\n\\(p(y_{\\text{new}}  \\mid  x_{\\text{new}}, D)\\)\n\n\n\nThe training can be performed via the Bayes rule \\[\np(\\theta \\mid D) = \\dfrac{p(Y \\mid \\theta,X)p(\\theta)}{\\int p(Y \\mid \\theta,X)p(\\theta)d\\theta}.\n\\] Now to perform the second step (prediction), we calculate \\[\np(y_{\\text{new}}  \\mid  x_{\\text{new}}, D) = \\int p(y_{\\text{new}}  \\mid  x_{\\text{new}},\\theta)p(\\theta \\mid D)d\\theta\n\\] Thus, full Bayesian inference requires calculating two integrals, which might be difficult. We mentioned earlier that MAP allows us to avoid those calculations by approximating the posterior with \\[\np(\\theta \\mid D) \\approx \\delta(\\theta_{\\text{MAP}}),~~\\theta_{\\text{MAP}} \\in \\arg\\max_{\\theta}p(\\theta \\mid D)\n\\] To calculate \\(\\theta_{\\text{MAP}}\\), we do not need to know the normalizing constant for calculating posterior, since the solution of optimization problem does not depend on this constant. Further, the second integral for inference becomes degenerate and get approximated by \\[\np(y_{\\text{new}}  \\mid  x_{\\text{new}}, D) = \\int p(y_{\\text{new}}  \\mid  x_{\\text{new}},\\theta)p(\\theta \\mid D)d\\theta \\approx p(y_{\\text{new}}  \\mid  x_{\\text{new}},\\theta_{\\text{MAP}}).\n\\]\nThe Figure 17.8 below illustrates the Bayesian model selection process. The figure shows the joint distribution over parameters and data for three models. You can think of each ellipse as the region where most of the probability mass is concentrated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.8: Bayesian model Selection\n\n\n\nIf we project the ellipses onto the parameter space, we get the prior distributions for each model. We can see that the \\(M_2\\) is the most concentrated. If we project the ellipses onto the data space, we get the prior distributions over data for each model.\nAfter observing data \\(D\\) (horizontal line), each prior gets updated. The intersection of the observed data line with each ellipse shows how well each model can explain the data. Models with good overlap between prior and observed data will have higher posterior probability. \\(M_3\\) appears to have the best intersection with the observed data, it is the model with the highest marginal likelihood.\nThis illustrates how Bayesian model selection naturally favors models that achieve the best balance between explaining the observed data and maintaining appropriate complexity, automatically implementing Occam’s razor through the evidence calculation.\n\nExample 17.6 (Racial discrimination) Say we want to analyze racial discrimination by the US courts. We have three variables:\n\nMurderer: \\(m \\in {0,1}\\) (black/white)\nVictim: \\(v \\in \\{0,1\\}\\) (black/white)\nVerdict: \\(d \\in \\{0,1\\}\\) (prison/death penalty)\n\nSay we have the data\n\n\n\nm\nv\nd\nn\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n132\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n19\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n9\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n52\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n11\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n97\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n6\n\n\n\nWe would like to establish a causal relations between the race and verdict variables. For this, we consider several models\n\n\\(p(d \\mid m,v) = p(d) = \\theta\\)\n\\(p(d \\mid m,v) = p(d \\mid v)\\); \\(p(d \\mid v=0) = \\alpha, ~p(d \\mid v=1)=\\beta\\)\n\\(p(d \\mid v,m) = p(d \\mid m)\\); \\(p(d \\mid m=1) = \\gamma,~p(d \\mid m=1) = \\delta\\)\n\\(p(d|v,m)\\) cannot be reduced, and\n\n\n\n\n\\(p(d=1 \\mid m,v)\\)\n\\(m=0\\)\n\\(m=1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(v=0\\)\n\\(\\tau\\)\n\\(\\chi\\)\n\n\n\\(v=1\\)\n\\(\\nu\\)\n\\(\\zeta\\)\n\n\n\n\nWe calculate which model describes data the best, we calculate the evidences. We need to describe the discriminative model \\[\np(Y ,\\theta \\mid X) = p(Y \\mid X,\\theta)p(\\theta \\mid X)\n\\] Here \\(X\\) is the number of cases, and \\(Y\\) is the number of death penalties. We use uninformative prior \\(\\theta \\sim U[0,1]\\). To specify the likelihood, we use Binomial distribution \\[\nY \\mid X,\\theta \\sim B(X,\\theta),~~B(Y \\mid X,\\theta) = C_Y^Xp^Y(1-\\theta)^{X-Y}\n\\] We assume \\(p(\\theta)\\sim Uniform\\). Now lets calculate the evidence \\[\np(Y, \\theta \\mid X) = \\int p(Y  \\mid  X,\\theta)p(\\theta)d\\theta\n\\] for each of the four models\n\n\\(p(Y \\mid X) = \\int B(19 \\mid 151,\\theta)B(0 \\mid 9,\\theta)B(11 \\mid 63,\\theta)B(6 \\mid 103,\\theta)d\\theta\\) \\(\\propto \\int_0^{1} \\theta^{36}(1-\\theta)^{290}d\\theta = B(37,291) = 2.8\\times 10^{-51}\\)\n\\(p(Y \\mid X) = \\int\\int B(19 \\mid 151,\\alpha)B(0 \\mid 9,\\beta)B(11 \\mid 63,\\alpha)B(6 \\mid 103,\\beta)d\\alpha d\\beta \\propto 4.7\\times 10^{-51}\\)\n\\(p(d \\mid v,m) = p(d \\mid m)=\\int\\int B(19 \\mid 151,\\gamma)B(0 \\mid 9,\\gamma)B(11 \\mid 63,\\delta)B(6 \\mid 103,\\delta)d\\gamma d\\delta \\propto 0.27\\times10^{-51}\\)\n\\(p(d \\mid v,m) = \\int\\int\\int\\int B(19 \\mid 151,\\tau)B(0 \\mid 9,\\nu)B(11 \\mid 63,\\chi)B(6 \\mid 103,\\zeta)d\\tau d\\nu d\\chi d\\zeta \\propto 0.18\\times10^{-51}\\)\n\nThe last model is too complex, it can explain any relations in the data and this, has the lowest evidence score! However, if we are to use ML estimates, the fourth model will have the highest likelihood. Bayesian approach allows to avoid over-fitting! You can also see that this data set contains the Simpson’s paradox. Check it! A related problem is Bertrand’s gold box problem.\nSimpson’s paradox is a phenomenon in probability and statistics where a trend appears in several different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined. This paradox illustrates the importance of considering confounding variables and the dangers of aggregating data without proper consideration of underlying structure.\nBertrand’s box paradox is a classic probability puzzle that demonstrates how conditional probability can be counterintuitive. The problem involves three identical boxes: one contains two gold coins, one contains two silver coins, and one contains one gold and one silver coin. A box is chosen at random, and a coin is drawn from it at random, revealing a gold coin. The question is: what is the probability that the other coin in the same box is also gold?\n\n\nBayesian Information Criterion (BIC)\nThe Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is a model selection criterion that penalizes the complexity of the model. It is derived from a Bayesian approach. The BIC is defined as:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{BIC} = \\log P(D\\mid \\hat{\\theta}_k, M_k) - \\frac{k}{2} \\log n.\n\\]\nHere \\(\\hat{\\theta}_k\\) is the MAP estimate of the \\(k\\) parameters in model \\(M_k\\), and \\(n\\) is the sample size. As such, there is a penalty \\(-\\frac{k}{2} \\log n\\) for increasing the dimensionality \\(k\\) of the model under consideration.\nThe BIC uses the marginal likelihood of the data under model \\(M_k\\) (denoted \\(M\\) for simplicity here), which is approximated using Laplace’s method.\nThe idea of Laplace’s method is to approximate integrals of the form \\(\\int f(\\theta) e^{-g(\\theta)} d\\theta\\) where \\(g(\\theta)\\) has a sharp minimum at some point \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\). The method works by approximating \\(g(\\theta)\\) with its second-order Taylor expansion around the minimum \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\). Since \\(g'(\\hat{\\theta}) = 0\\) at the minimum, we have\n\\[\ng(\\theta) \\approx g(\\hat{\\theta}) + \\frac{1}{2}g''(\\hat{\\theta})(\\theta-\\hat{\\theta})^2.\n\\] So the integral transforms into a Gaussian form: \\[\n\\int f(\\theta) e^{-g(\\theta)} d\\theta \\approx f(\\hat{\\theta}) e^{-g(\\hat{\\theta})} \\int e^{-\\frac{1}{2}g''(\\hat{\\theta})(\\theta-\\hat{\\theta})^2} d\\theta.\n\\]\nThe remaining integral is a standard Gaussian integral that evaluates to \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{g''(\\hat{\\theta})}}\\), giving us:\n\\[\n\\int f(\\theta) e^{-g(\\theta)} d\\theta \\approx f(\\hat{\\theta}) e^{-g(\\hat{\\theta})} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{g''(\\hat{\\theta})}}.\n\\]\nIn the multivariate case, we have \\(\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^k\\) is a \\(k\\)-dimensional parameter vector. The second-order Taylor expansion around the minimum \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) becomes: \\[\ng(\\theta) \\approx g(\\hat{\\theta}) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\theta-\\hat{\\theta})^T \\mathbf{H}(\\hat{\\theta}) (\\theta-\\hat{\\theta}),\n\\] where \\(\\mathbf{H}(\\hat{\\theta})\\) is the \\(k \\times k\\) Hessian matrix of second derivatives at \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\). The multivariate Gaussian integral then evaluates to:\n\\[\n\\int f(\\theta) e^{-g(\\theta)} d\\theta \\approx f(\\hat{\\theta}) e^{-g(\\hat{\\theta})} (2\\pi)^{k/2} |\\det(\\mathbf{H}(\\hat{\\theta}))|^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\nIn the context of Bayesian model selection, we apply this to approximate the marginal likelihood (evidence). We have:\n\\[\nP(D\\mid M) = \\int P(D\\mid \\theta,M)P(\\theta\\mid M)d\\theta\n\\]\nTaking the logarithm and identifying \\(g(\\theta) = -\\log P(D\\mid \\theta,M)P(\\theta\\mid M)\\), the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) corresponds to the minimum of \\(g(\\theta)\\). The second derivative (Hessian) \\(\\mathbf{H}(\\hat{\\theta})\\) at this point determines the curvature of the log-posterior.\n\\[\nP(D\\mid M) = \\int P(D\\mid \\theta,M)P(\\theta\\mid M)d\\theta \\approx P(D\\mid \\hat{\\theta},M)P(\\hat{\\theta}\\mid M) (2 \\pi)^{k/2} |\\det(\\mathbf{H}(\\hat{\\theta}))|^{-\\frac{1}{2}}.\n\\]\nHere \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is the posterior mode (MAP estimate), and \\(\\mathbf{H}(\\hat{\\theta})\\) is the negative Hessian of the log-posterior at the mode. Taking the logarithm, and assuming \\(P(\\hat{\\theta}|M)\\) and Hessian terms are \\(O_p(1)\\) or scale appropriately with \\(n\\) (this assumption is justified because as \\(n\\) increases, the likelihood dominates the prior, making the prior term negligible relative to the \\(O(\\log n)\\) likelihood term, while the Hessian determinant typically grows polynomially in \\(n\\), contributing at most \\(O(\\log n)\\) terms that are absorbed into the approximation), we get:\n\\[\n\\log P(D\\mid M) \\approx \\log P(D\\mid \\hat{\\theta},M) - \\dfrac{k}{2}\\log n,\n\\]\nwhich is proportional to the BIC. (Note: The exact definition and derivation of BIC can vary slightly, but this captures the essence). The BIC approximation shows how the Bayesian approach naturally penalizes model complexity through the dimensionality term \\(-\\frac{k}{2}\\log n\\).\nThe Bayesian approach averages over the posterior distribution of models given data. Suppose that we have a finite list of models \\(M \\in \\{M_1, \\ldots, M_J\\}\\). Then we can calculate the posterior over models as:\n\\[\np(M_j | y) = \\frac{p(y | M_j) p(M_j)}{\\sum_{i=1}^J p(y | M_i) p(M_i)}, \\quad \\text{where}\\; p(y | M_j) = \\int L_j(\\theta_j|y) p(\\theta_j | M_j) d\\theta_j.\n\\]\nLaplace’s approximation provides a simple (Lindley 1961) illustration of how dimensionality is weighted in the Bayesian paradigm. Hence, BIC is related to a log-posterior approximation. Hence, if prior model probabilities \\(P(M_j)\\) are uniform, then \\(P(M_j\\mid D) \\propto P(D \\mid M_j) \\approx \\exp(\\mathrm{BIC}_j)\\).\nIn a more general case, the evidence (a.k.a. marginal likelihood) for hypotheses (a.k.a. models) \\(M_i\\) is calculated as follows:\n\\[\nP(D\\mid M_i) = \\int P(D\\mid \\theta, M_i)P(\\theta\\mid M_i)d\\theta.\n\\]\nLaplace approximation, in the one-dimensional case (\\(k=1\\)), yields:\n\\[\nP(D\\mid M_i) \\approx P(D\\mid \\hat{\\theta}, M_i)P(\\hat{\\theta}\\mid M_i)\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_{\\text{post}}.\n\\]\nHere \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is the maximum (MAP) estimate of the parameter and \\(\\sigma_{\\text{post}} = (-H(\\hat{\\theta}))^{-1/2}\\) where \\(H(\\hat{\\theta})\\) is the second derivative of the log-posterior at \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\).\nGenerally, in the \\(k\\)-dimensional case, we have:\n\\[\nP(D\\mid M_i) \\approx P(D\\mid \\hat{\\theta}, M_i)P(\\hat{\\theta}\\mid M_i) (2\\pi)^{k/2} |\\det(-\\mathbf{H}(\\hat{\\theta}))|^{-\\frac{1}{2}}.\n\\]\nHere \\(\\mathbf{H}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\nabla^2\\log (P(D\\mid \\hat{\\theta}, M_i)P(\\hat{\\theta}\\mid M_i))\\) is the Hessian of the log-posterior function evaluated at the mode \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\). As the amount of data collected increases, this Gaussian approximation is expected to become increasingly accurate.\nMackay (MacKay 1992) proposes the NIC criterion for selection of neural networks.\n\n\nNeural Information Criterion (NIC)\nDavid MacKay’s Neural Information Criterion (NIC) and the associated evidence framework represent pioneering efforts to apply Bayesian model selection principles to neural networks. This framework addresses the fundamental challenge of selecting appropriate network architectures and hyperparameters by computing approximations to the marginal likelihood, or model evidence, for different neural network configurations.\nThe evidence framework builds upon the Laplace approximation to estimate the marginal likelihood of neural network models. Given a neural network with parameters \\(\\theta\\) and hyperparameters \\(\\alpha\\) (such as weight decay parameters), the evidence for a particular model configuration is:\n\\[\nP(D|M,\\alpha) = \\int P(D|\\theta,M) P(\\theta|M,\\alpha) d\\theta\n\\]\nwhere \\(D\\) represents the training data, \\(M\\) denotes the model architecture, and \\(P(\\theta|M,\\alpha)\\) is the prior distribution over network weights. The Laplace approximation evaluates this integral by expanding the log-posterior around its mode \\(\\hat \\theta\\), yielding:\n\\[\n\\log P(D|M,\\alpha) \\approx \\log P(D|\\hat \\theta,M) + \\log P(\\hat \\theta|M,\\alpha) - \\frac{1}{2}\\log|H|\n\\]\nwhere \\(H\\) is the Hessian of the negative log-posterior at the mode \\(\\hat \\theta\\). This approximation transforms the intractable integral into a computation involving the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate and the curvature of the posterior at that point.\nThe evidence framework provides a principled approach to several critical decisions in neural network design. For hyperparameter selection, the framework automatically determines optimal regularization strengths by maximizing the evidence with respect to hyperparameters such as weight decay coefficients. Rather than relying on cross-validation, which can be computationally expensive and may not capture the full uncertainty in hyperparameter selection, the evidence provides a direct measure of how well different hyperparameter values support the observed data.\nArchitecture comparison becomes feasible through direct evidence computation for different network structures. The framework can compare networks with different numbers of hidden units, layers, or connectivity patterns by evaluating their respective marginal likelihoods. This comparison naturally incorporates Occam’s razor, as more complex architectures are penalized through the integration over their larger parameter spaces, unless the additional complexity is justified by substantially improved fit to the data.\nThe Hessian computation required for the Laplace approximation presents significant computational challenges for modern deep networks with millions or billions of parameters. The full Hessian matrix would be prohibitively large to compute and store explicitly. MacKay’s original framework addressed this through various approximation strategies, including the use of automatic relevance determination (ARD) priors that allow the network to effectively prune irrelevant connections by driving their associated precision parameters to infinity.\n\n\nAutomatic Relevance Determination (ARD)\nThe key insight of Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) is to introduce separate precision hyperparameters for different groups of parameters, allowing the model to automatically determine which features or components are relevant for the task.\nIn the context of neural networks, consider a network with weights \\(\\mathbf{w} = \\{w_{ij}\\}\\) connecting input features to hidden units. Instead of using a single precision parameter \\(\\alpha\\) for all weights, ARD introduces feature-specific precision parameters \\(\\{\\alpha_i\\}_{i=1}^{p}\\) where \\(p\\) is the number of input features. The prior distribution for weights becomes:\n\\[\np(\\mathbf{w}|\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{p} \\prod_{j=1}^{H} \\mathcal{N}(w_{ij}|0, \\alpha_i^{-1})\n\\]\nwhere \\(H\\) is the number of hidden units and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = (\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_p)\\) are the precision hyperparameters.\nThe hierarchical Bayesian model is completed by placing hyperpriors on the precision parameters:\n\\[\np(\\alpha_i) = \\text{Gamma}(\\alpha_i|a_i, b_i)\n\\]\nwhere \\(a_i\\) and \\(b_i\\) are shape and rate parameters, often set to small values (e.g., \\(a_i = b_i = 10^{-6}\\)) to create weakly informative priors.\nThe ARD mechanism works through the evidence framework by optimizing the marginal likelihood with respect to the hyperparameters. For a given precision \\(\\alpha_i\\), the effective contribution of feature \\(i\\) to the model evidence can be approximated as:\n\\[\n\\log p(D|\\alpha_i) \\approx -\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha_i \\|\\mathbf{w}_i\\|^2 + \\frac{H}{2}\\log\\alpha_i - \\frac{1}{2}\\log|\\mathbf{A}_i|\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{w}_i\\) represents all weights associated with feature \\(i\\), and \\(\\mathbf{A}_i\\) is the corresponding block of the Hessian matrix.\nWhen a feature is irrelevant, the optimal precision \\(\\alpha_i^*\\) tends to infinity, effectively removing the feature from the model. This occurs because the evidence balances the model fit (first term) against the model complexity (second and third terms). For irrelevant features, the improvement in fit is insufficient to justify the complexity cost, driving \\(\\alpha_i\\) to large values.\nThe ARD update equations, derived by maximizing the marginal likelihood, are:\n\\[\n\\alpha_i^{\\text{new}} = \\frac{\\gamma_i}{\\|\\mathbf{w}_i\\|^2}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma_i\\) is the effective number of parameters associated with feature \\(i\\):\n\\[\n\\gamma_i = H - \\alpha_i \\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{A}_i^{-1})\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{A}_i^{-1})\\) represents the trace of the inverse of the Hessian block corresponding to feature \\(i\\).\nExample: Linear Regression with ARD\nConsider a linear regression model with ARD priors:\n\\[\ny = \\sum_{i=1}^{p} w_i x_i + \\epsilon, \\quad \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\beta^{-1})\n\\]\nwith priors: \\[\nw_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\alpha_i^{-1}), \\quad i = 1, \\ldots, p\n\\]\nThe posterior distribution for the weights is:\n\\[\np(\\mathbf{w}|D, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}, \\beta) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{w}|\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\mathbf{\\Sigma})\n\\]\nwhere: \\[\n\\mathbf{\\Sigma} = (\\beta \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X} + \\text{diag}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}))^{-1}\n\\] \\[\n\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = \\beta \\mathbf{\\Sigma} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}\n\\]\nThe ARD updates become: \\[\n\\alpha_i^{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1 - \\alpha_i \\Sigma_{ii}}{\\mu_i^2}\n\\]\nWhen \\(\\alpha_i\\) becomes very large, the corresponding \\(\\mu_i \\approx 0\\) and \\(\\Sigma_{ii} \\approx 0\\), effectively removing feature \\(i\\) from the model.\nExample: Neural Network Feature Selection\nIn a neural network with \\(p\\) input features and \\(H\\) hidden units, ARD can automatically determine which input features are relevant. Suppose we have a dataset with features representing different types of measurements, some of which may be irrelevant for the prediction task.\nThe network architecture is: \\[\nh_j = \\tanh\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{p} w_{ij} x_i + b_j\\right), \\quad j = 1, \\ldots, H\n\\] \\[\ny = \\sum_{j=1}^{H} v_j h_j + c\n\\]\nWith ARD priors on input weights: \\[\nw_{ij} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\alpha_i^{-1}), \\quad \\text{for all } j\n\\]\nAfter training with the evidence framework, features with large \\(\\alpha_i\\) values (typically \\(\\alpha_i &gt; 10^6\\)) are considered irrelevant and can be pruned. This automatic feature selection often reveals that only a subset of the original features are necessary for good predictive performance.\nThe ARD principle extends beyond feature selection to other forms of model selection, including:\n\nUnit pruning: Using separate precisions for different hidden units to determine optimal network architecture\nGroup selection: Applying ARD to groups of related parameters (e.g., all weights in a particular layer)\nSparse coding: In dictionary learning, ARD can automatically determine the effective dictionary size\n\nThe computational implementation of ARD involves iterating between updating the model parameters (weights) and the hyperparameters (precisions) until convergence. Modern implementations often use variational approximations or sampling methods to handle the computational challenges of the full Bayesian treatment, while maintaining the automatic model selection capabilities that make ARD so valuable in practice.\nModern adaptations of the evidence framework have developed sophisticated methods to handle the computational challenges of contemporary deep learning. For example, linearized Laplace approximations—such as those described by Ritter et al. (2018) (Ritter, Botev, and Barber 2018) and Immer et al. (2021) (Immer et al. 2021)—approximate the neural network through its first-order Taylor expansion around the MAP estimate, reducing the complexity of Hessian computations while maintaining reasonable approximation quality. These linearized approaches are particularly effective for networks that are sufficiently wide or when the posterior is approximately Gaussian.\nKronecker-structured approximations represent another significant advancement, exploiting the structure of neural network computations to factorize the Hessian matrix into more manageable components. By recognizing that gradients in neural networks can be expressed as Kronecker products of activations and error signals, these methods achieve substantial computational savings while preserving much of the information contained in the full Hessian matrix. Singh, Farrell-Maupin, and Faghihi (2024) revisit and advance the Laplace approximation for Bayesian deep learning, addressing its scalability and effectiveness for modern neural networks. The paper introduces new algorithmic and theoretical developments that make Laplace-based Bayesian inference practical for large-scale deep learning tasks. The authors propose efficient algorithms for computing the Laplace approximation in deep neural networks, leveraging block-diagonal and Kronecker-factored structures to approximate the Hessian of the loss function, which enables uncertainty quantification in models with millions of parameters.\nOn the theoretical side, the paper provides a new analysis of the Laplace approximation in high-dimensional and overparameterized regimes typical of deep learning. Specifically, the authors derive non-asymptotic error bounds for the Laplace approximation, showing how its accuracy depends on the curvature of the loss landscape and the concentration of the posterior. They analyze the impact of model width and data size on the quality of the Gaussian approximation, and clarify under what conditions the Laplace approximation remains reliable as the number of parameters grows. This theoretical work helps explain when and why Laplace-based uncertainty estimates are trustworthy in modern neural networks, and guides the design of scalable algorithms for practical Bayesian deep learning.\nThe evidence framework also naturally handles the multiple scales of uncertainty present in neural networks. Parameter uncertainty captures the uncertainty in individual weight values given the training data, while hyperparameter uncertainty reflects uncertainty about the appropriate level of regularization or architectural choices. Model uncertainty encompasses uncertainty about the fundamental model class or architecture family. The hierarchical Bayesian treatment allows simultaneous reasoning about all these sources of uncertainty within a unified framework.\nDespite its theoretical elegance, the evidence framework faces practical limitations in very large-scale applications. The computational requirements of Hessian approximation, even with modern efficient methods, can be substantial for networks with hundreds of millions of parameters. The Laplace approximation itself may be inadequate when the posterior is highly non-Gaussian, which can occur in networks with many local minima or complex loss landscapes.\nThe enduring value of MacKay’s evidence framework lies in its principled approach to the fundamental trade-offs in machine learning model design. By providing a theoretically grounded method for balancing model complexity against data fit, the framework offers insights that remain relevant even as the scale and sophistication of machine learning models continue to evolve. The automatic hyperparameter selection and architecture comparison capabilities of the evidence framework continue to influence contemporary approaches to neural architecture search and automated machine learning.\nYet another approach is the Widely applicable Bayesian Information Criterion (WBIC) proposed by Watanabe (2013). It is a generalization of the traditional BIC that addresses some of its fundamental limitations, particularly when dealing with singular statistical models and complex machine learning architectures. It addresses the problem when BIC’s assumptions that the true parameter lies in the interior of the parameter space and that the information matrix is positive definite are violated. These regularity conditions fail for many important models such as neural networks with hidden units, mixture models where the number of components is unknown, tree-based models with unknown structure, and models with parameter constraints or boundaries. Second, BIC requires knowing the effective number of parameters \\(k\\), which can be ambiguous for complex models. This becomes problematic when dealing with shared parameters across different parts of the model, regularization that effectively reduces the parameter dimension, or hierarchical structures where the effective dimensionality depends on the data. The challenge of defining the “true” number of parameters in modern machine learning models makes BIC’s penalty term difficult to specify correctly.",

    "text": "17.8 Model Selection and Bayesian Relativity\nBayes’ rule provides only relative evidence between models. Classical approaches try to find absolute truth, but Bayesian model selection is fundamentally comparative. Consider the basic relationship: \\[\n\\frac{p(H_0 \\mid D)}{p(H_1 \\mid D)} = \\frac{p(D \\mid H_0)}{p(D \\mid H_1)} \\frac{p(H_0)}{p(H_1)}\n\\]\nWhen \\(D = \\{T(y) &gt; t_{obs}\\}\\), the numerator is the p-value. However, this needs to be assessed relative to the p-value under the alternative, which might be even more unlikely! As Sherlock Holmes noted: “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” Even though an event may be unlikely under \\(H_0\\), it could be the best available description given the alternatives.\nFisher recognized this issue: “In scientific inference, a hypothesis is never proved but merely shown to be more or less probable relative to the available alternatives.” The problem with p-values is that they attempt to be an objective measure of model “fit” without considering alternatives. Unlikely events do occur under a “true” model.\n\nExhaustive vs Non-Exhaustive Hypotheses\nA key point is that you can always calculate the relative evidence between two hypotheses. In cases where hypotheses are exhaustive, \\(p(H_0) + p(H_1) = 1\\), we can directly calculate \\(p(H_0 \\mid D)\\) and we obtain the true probability given the data. In general, we have some priot probability left over for a model that is not in the set of models under consideration. But, you can still use the Bayes rule for relative evidence to obtain just a relative ordering: \\[\n\\frac{p(H_0 \\mid D)}{p(H_1 \\mid D)} = \\frac{p(D \\mid H_0)}{p(D \\mid H_1)} \\frac{p(H_0)}{p(H_1)}\n\\]\nThis holds for \\(p(H_0) + p(H_1) &lt; 1\\). An important benefit of this rational approach is that if a new hypothesis \\(H_2\\) comes along, the relative calculation between \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_1\\) doesn’t change! This is a benefit of rational decision-making. However, posterior probabilities can change if we re-normalize to account for the new alternative.",

    "text": "17.11 Model Explainability\nIn some applications, the model explanabilty is important criterion for model selection. For example, in finance or insurance, the model explanabilty is important for the model to be accepted by the regulators. It is highly unlekely a black box model will ever be used for medical or criminal justice applications. While earlier in this chapter we introduced several explainability techniques in the context of fundamental considerations, here we provide a comprehensive treatment of model explainability methods, their applications, and a broader perspective on the role of explanation in scientific and practical domains.\nModern machine learning has developed a rich toolkit of methods to interpret and explain model predictions. These methods vary in their scope (global vs. local explanations), their model specificity (model-agnostic vs. model-specific), and their theoretical foundations.\nModel-Agnostic Methods provide explanations that work with any machine learning model by treating it as a black box. LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) (ribeiro2016why?) creates explanations for individual predictions by training simple, interpretable models locally around the prediction of interest. The algorithm perturbs the input and observes how the model’s predictions change, then fits a linear model weighted by proximity to the original instance. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) (lundberg2017unified?) provides a unified framework based on game theory, specifically Shapley values from cooperative game theory. SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction, satisfying desirable properties like local accuracy, missingness, and consistency. The method has become widely adopted due to its solid theoretical foundation and availability of efficient implementations for various model types.\nPartial Dependence Plots (PDP) (friedman2001greedy?) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots (goldstein2015peeking?) offer visual methods to understand how features influence predictions across the entire dataset. PDPs show the marginal effect of a feature on the predicted outcome by averaging over all other features, while ICE plots show the prediction dependence for individual instances. Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) (apley2020visualizing?) improve upon PDPs by accounting for feature correlations, providing more reliable interpretations in high-dimensional spaces.\nGradient-Based Methods leverage the internal structure of differentiable models, particularly neural networks. Saliency maps (simonyan2013deep?) compute gradients of the output with respect to input features to identify which inputs most influence predictions. Integrated Gradients (sundararajan2017axiomatic?) improve upon simple gradients by integrating gradients along a path from a baseline to the actual input, satisfying important axioms like sensitivity and implementation invariance. Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) (selvaraju2017grad?) generates visual explanations for convolutional neural networks by computing gradients of the target class with respect to feature maps in the final convolutional layer, producing class-discriminative localization maps that highlight important regions in images.\nAttention Mechanisms Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio (2014) provide built-in interpretability, particularly in natural language processing and computer vision. By learning to focus on relevant parts of the input, attention weights offer direct insight into which components the model considers important for its predictions. Transformer architectures (vaswani2017attention?) have made attention mechanisms ubiquitous in modern deep learning, though interpreting multi-head attention in large language models remains an active research area (clark2019does?).\nModel-Specific Interpretability includes methods designed for particular model architectures. Tree-based models like random forests and gradient boosting machines provide natural feature importance measures based on how much each feature decreases impurity or loss across splits (breiman2001random?) (friedman2001greedy?). Linear models offer direct coefficient interpretation, though care must be taken with correlated features. Rule extraction methods (craven1996extracting?) attempt to distill complex models into human-readable rule sets.\nCounterfactual Explanations (wachter2017counterfactual?) answer the question “what would need to change for the prediction to be different?” by finding the minimal modifications to input features that would alter the model’s decision. This approach is particularly valuable in applications like loan decisions, where explaining why an application was rejected is less actionable than explaining what changes would lead to approval.\nWe now provide detailed mathematical foundations for the most widely-used explainability methods, accompanied by practical demonstrations in R. These methods represent the core toolkit for model interpretation in modern machine learning practice.\n\nSHAP Values: Game-Theoretic Attribution\nSHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) provides a unified measure of feature importance based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory. For a prediction \\(f(x)\\) where \\(x = (x_1, \\ldots, x_p)\\) are the features, SHAP assigns each feature \\(i\\) an importance value \\(\\phi_i\\) that satisfies several desirable properties.\nThe Shapley value for feature \\(i\\) is defined as: \\[\n\\phi_i = \\sum_{S \\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,p\\} \\setminus \\{i\\}} \\frac{|S|! (p - |S| - 1)!}{p!} [f(S \\cup \\{i\\}) - f(S)]\n\\]\nwhere \\(S\\) represents a coalition of features, \\(f(S)\\) is the model’s prediction when only features in \\(S\\) are present (other features are replaced by their expected values), and the sum is over all possible subsets \\(S\\) not containing feature \\(i\\). This formula computes the average marginal contribution of feature \\(i\\) across all possible orderings of features.\nSHAP satisfies three key properties:\n\nLocal accuracy: \\(f(x) = \\phi_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^p \\phi_i\\) where \\(\\phi_0\\) is the base prediction\nMissingness: If \\(x_i\\) doesn’t affect the model, then \\(\\phi_i = 0\\)\nConsistency: If a model changes so that feature \\(i\\) has larger marginal contribution, \\(\\phi_i\\) should not decrease\n\nFor tree-based models, efficient algorithms like TreeSHAP compute exact Shapley values in polynomial time rather than exponential time. Consider data fgenerated from \\[\ny = 2x_1 + 1.5x_2 + 0.5x_1x_2 + \\epsilon, ~\\epsilon \\sim N(0, 0.5), ~x_i\\sim N(0, 1), ~i=1,2,3,4\n\\]\nWe train a random forest model on this data and compute the SHAP values for the first instance.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(randomForest)\nlibrary(shapr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Create a synthetic dataset for demonstration\nset.seed(123)\nn &lt;- 500\nx1 &lt;- rnorm(n)\nx2 &lt;- rnorm(n)\nx3 &lt;- rnorm(n)\nx4 &lt;- rnorm(n)\n# True relationship: y depends strongly on x1 and x2\ny &lt;- 2*x1 + 1.5*x2 + 0.5*x1*x2 + rnorm(n, sd=0.5)\n\ndata &lt;- data.frame(y, x1, x2, x3, x4)\n\n\n\n# Train a random forest model\nrf_model &lt;- randomForest(y ~ ., data=data, ntree=100)\n\n# Compute SHAP values using the iml package\nlibrary(iml)\npredictor &lt;- Predictor$new(rf_model, data=data[,-1], y=data$y)\n\n# Select a few instances to explain\ninstances_to_explain &lt;- data[1:3, -1]\n\n# Compute SHAP values using TreeSHAP approximation\nshap_values &lt;- Shapley$new(predictor, x.interest = instances_to_explain[1,])\n\n# Plot SHAP values for the first instance\nplot(shap_values) +\n  ggtitle(\"SHAP Values for First Instance\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# For a global view, compute SHAP values for many instances\n# and visualize feature importance\nlibrary(fastshap)\nshap_values_all &lt;- explain(rf_model, X = data[,-1], \n                            pred_wrapper = function(m, newdata) predict(m, newdata),\n                            nsim = 50, # number of Monte Carlo samples\n                            newdata = data[1:100, -1])\n\n# Calculate mean absolute SHAP values for global importance\nmean_shap &lt;- colMeans(abs(shap_values_all))\nimportance_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  feature = names(mean_shap),\n  importance = mean_shap\n)\n\nggplot(importance_df, aes(x=reorder(feature, importance), y=importance)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", fill=\"steelblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title=\"Global Feature Importance (Mean |SHAP|)\",\n       x=\"Feature\", y=\"Mean |SHAP Value|\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SHAP values provide both local explanations (why did the model make this specific prediction?) and global feature importance (which features are most important overall?).\n\n\nLIME: Local Linear Approximations\nLIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) explains individual predictions by fitting an interpretable model locally around the prediction of interest. For a complex model \\(f\\) and instance \\(x\\), LIME finds an interpretable explanation model \\(g \\in G\\) (typically a linear model) that minimizes:\n\\[\n\\xi(x) = \\arg\\min_{g \\in G} \\mathcal{L}(f, g, \\pi_x) + \\Omega(g)\n\\]\nwhere: - \\(\\mathcal{L}(f, g, \\pi_x)\\) measures how well \\(g\\) approximates \\(f\\) in the locality defined by \\(\\pi_x\\) - \\(\\pi_x(z)\\) is a proximity measure that weights points \\(z\\) by their distance to \\(x\\) - \\(\\Omega(g)\\) penalizes model complexity to ensure interpretability\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\nGenerate perturbations \\(z^{(1)}, \\ldots, z^{(m)}\\) around \\(x\\)\nCompute predictions \\(f(z^{(i)})\\) for each perturbation\nWeight samples by proximity: \\(w_i = \\pi_x(z^{(i)})\\)\nFit weighted linear model: \\(g(z) = w_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^p w_j z_j\\)\n\nFor tabular data, perturbations are typically generated by sampling from a normal distribution around the original values. The proximity kernel is often an exponential kernel:\n\\[\n\\pi_x(z) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d(x,z)^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\(d(x,z)\\) is a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance for continuous features).\n\nlibrary(lime)\nlibrary(caret)\n\n# Train a model using caret (lime has excellent support for caret models)\n# Use random forest via caret interface\nset.seed(123)\ntrain_control &lt;- trainControl(method=\"none\")\ncaret_model &lt;- train(y ~ ., \n                     data=data,\n                     method=\"rf\",\n                     trControl=train_control,\n                     ntree=100,\n                     tuneGrid=data.frame(mtry=2))\n\n# Create LIME explainer\nexplainer &lt;- lime(data[,-1], caret_model, n_bins=5)\n\n# Explain specific predictions\nexplanations &lt;- explain(instances_to_explain, explainer, \n                       n_features=4, n_permutations=1000)\n\n# Visualize the explanation for the first instance\nplot_features(explanations[explanations$case == 1,], ncol=1) +\n  ggtitle(\"LIME Explanation for Instance 1\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The output shows which features support or contradict the prediction\n# and by how much in the local region\n# Each feature's contribution is shown with its value range and effect\n\nLIME’s key advantage is its model-agnostic nature—it can explain any black-box model. However, the quality of explanations depends on the choice of perturbation strategy and kernel width, which may require tuning.\n\n\nPartial Dependence Plots and ICE\nPartial Dependence Plots (PDPs) visualize the marginal effect of a feature on the predicted outcome. For a feature \\(x_j\\) and model \\(f\\), the partial dependence function is:\n\\[\n\\text{PD}_{x_j}(x_j) = \\E_{x_{\\setminus j}}[f(x_j, x_{\\setminus j})] = \\int f(x_j, x_{\\setminus j}) p(x_{\\setminus j}) dx_{\\setminus j}\n\\]\nwhere \\(x_{\\setminus j}\\) denotes all features except \\(x_j\\). In practice, this is approximated by:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{PD}}_{x_j}(x_j) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_j, x_{\\setminus j}^{(i)})\n\\]\nThis averages the model’s predictions over the marginal distribution of the other features.\nIndividual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots show the prediction function for each instance separately, revealing heterogeneity:\n\\[\n\\text{ICE}^{(i)}_{x_j}(x_j) = f(x_j, x_{\\setminus j}^{(i)})\n\\]\nICE plots can reveal interactions that PDPs (which average over instances) might mask.\n\nlibrary(pdp)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\n# Partial dependence plots for key features\npd_x1 &lt;- partial(rf_model, pred.var=\"x1\", train=data)\npd_x2 &lt;- partial(rf_model, pred.var=\"x2\", train=data)\n\np1 &lt;- autoplot(pd_x1, main=\"PDP: x1\") + theme_minimal()\np2 &lt;- autoplot(pd_x2, main=\"PDP: x2\") + theme_minimal()\n\ngrid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# ICE plots show individual curves\nice_x1 &lt;- partial(rf_model, pred.var=\"x1\", train=data, \n                  ice=TRUE, center=FALSE)\n\n# Plot ICE curves for x1\nggplot(ice_x1, aes(x=x1, y=yhat, group=yhat.id)) +\n  geom_line(alpha=0.2, color=\"steelblue\") +\n  stat_summary(aes(group=1), fun=\"mean\", geom=\"line\", \n               color=\"red\", linewidth=1.5) +\n  labs(title=\"ICE Plot for x1 (Red = Average PDP)\",\n       y=\"Predicted y\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 2D PDP for interaction effects\npd_x1_x2 &lt;- partial(rf_model, pred.var=c(\"x1\", \"x2\"), \n                    train=data, chull=TRUE)\n\nautoplot(pd_x1_x2, contour=TRUE, legend.title=\"Prediction\") +\n  ggtitle(\"2D PDP: x1 and x2 Interaction\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2D PDP reveals interaction effects between features. When the contour lines are not parallel to the axes, an interaction is present.\n\n\nAccumulated Local Effects (ALE)\nALE plots (apley2020visualizing?) improve upon PDPs by accumulating local effects rather than computing marginal expectations. This makes them unbiased even when features are correlated. The ALE for feature \\(x_j\\) is:\n\\[\n\\text{ALE}_{x_j}(x_j) = \\int_{z_{0,j}}^{x_j} \\E_{x_{\\setminus j}|x_j}\\left[\\frac{\\partial f(x_j, x_{\\setminus j})}{\\partial x_j} \\bigg| x_j = z_j\\right] dz_j\n\\]\nThis integrates the conditional expected derivative of \\(f\\) with respect to \\(x_j\\), conditional on the value of \\(x_j\\) itself. In discrete form:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{ALE}}_{x_j}(x_j) = \\sum_{k=1}^{k_j} \\frac{1}{n_k} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}_k} \\left[f(z_{k,j}, x_{\\setminus j}^{(i)}) - f(z_{k-1,j}, x_{\\setminus j}^{(i)})\\right]\n\\]\nwhere the feature space is divided into intervals, and effects are accumulated.\n\n# The iml package provides ALE functionality built-in\n# No need for the separate ALEPlot package\n\n# Create correlated features to show ALE advantage\nset.seed(456)\nn &lt;- 500\nx1_corr &lt;- rnorm(n)\nx2_corr &lt;- 0.7*x1_corr + rnorm(n, sd=0.5)  # Correlated with x1\ny_corr &lt;- 2*x1_corr + 1.5*x2_corr + rnorm(n, sd=0.5)\n\ndata_corr &lt;- data.frame(y=y_corr, x1=x1_corr, x2=x2_corr)\nrf_corr &lt;- randomForest(y ~ ., data=data_corr, ntree=100)\n\n# Compare PDP vs ALE for correlated features using iml\npredictor_corr &lt;- Predictor$new(rf_corr, data=data_corr[,-1], \n                                y=data_corr$y)\n\n# PDP for x1\neffect_pdp &lt;- FeatureEffect$new(predictor_corr, feature=\"x1\", \n                                method=\"pdp\", grid.size=30)\n# ALE for x1\neffect_ale &lt;- FeatureEffect$new(predictor_corr, feature=\"x1\", \n                                method=\"ale\", grid.size=30)\n\n# Plot both to compare\np_pdp &lt;- plot(effect_pdp) + \n  ggtitle(\"PDP for x1 (Correlated Features)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\np_ale &lt;- plot(effect_ale) + \n  ggtitle(\"ALE for x1 (Correlated Features)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\ngrid.arrange(p_pdp, p_ale, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen features are correlated, PDP can produce unrealistic feature combinations by pairing values that never occur together in the data. ALE avoids this by only computing local effects conditional on the actual distribution of the data, making it more reliable for interpreting models with correlated features.\n\n\nFeature Importance for Tree-Based Models\nTree-based models provide natural feature importance measures. For random forests, there are two main approaches:\nImpurity-Based Importance: Measures the total decrease in node impurity (e.g., MSE for regression, Gini for classification) weighted by the probability of reaching that node:\n\\[\n\\text{Importance}(x_j) = \\sum_{t \\in \\text{Trees}} \\sum_{n \\in \\text{Nodes}(t, x_j)} p(n) \\Delta I(n, x_j)\n\\]\nwhere \\(p(n)\\) is the proportion of samples reaching node \\(n\\), and \\(\\Delta I(n, x_j)\\) is the decrease in impurity from splitting on feature \\(x_j\\) at node \\(n\\).\nPermutation Importance: Measures the decrease in model performance when a feature’s values are randomly permuted:\n\\[\n\\text{PI}(x_j) = \\text{Error}(\\text{model}, D^{\\pi_j}) - \\text{Error}(\\text{model}, D)\n\\]\nwhere \\(D^{\\pi_j}\\) is the dataset with feature \\(x_j\\) permuted. This can be computed on out-of-bag samples for random forests.\n\nlibrary(vip)\nlibrary(ranger)\n\n# Use original dataset with varying feature importance\n# Train random forest with ranger (faster implementation)\nrf_ranger &lt;- ranger(y ~ ., data=data, importance=\"permutation\", \n                    num.trees=100)\n\n# Extract and visualize permutation importance\nimportance_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  feature = names(rf_ranger$variable.importance),\n  importance = rf_ranger$variable.importance\n)\n\nggplot(importance_df, aes(x=reorder(feature, importance), y=importance)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", fill=\"darkgreen\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title=\"Permutation Feature Importance\",\n       x=\"Feature\", y=\"Importance (Decrease in R²)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Using vip package for more comprehensive importance plots\nvip(rf_ranger, num_features=4, \n    geom=\"point\", horizontal=TRUE, aesthetics=list(color=\"steelblue\", size=3)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Variable Importance Plot\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Conditional permutation importance (accounts for correlation)\nlibrary(permimp)\n# This requires the party package's conditional inference trees\nlibrary(party)\n\n# Note: For very large datasets, consider sampling\nsample_idx &lt;- sample(1:nrow(data), min(200, nrow(data)))\ndata_sample &lt;- data[sample_idx, ]\n\ncforest_model &lt;- cforest(y ~ ., data=data_sample, \n                         controls=cforest_unbiased(ntree=50))\n\n# Conditional importance handles correlated features better\ncond_imp &lt;- varimp(cforest_model, conditional=TRUE)\n\ncond_imp_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  feature = names(cond_imp),\n  importance = cond_imp\n)\n\nggplot(cond_imp_df, aes(x=reorder(feature, importance), y=importance)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", fill=\"purple\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title=\"Conditional Permutation Importance\",\n       subtitle=\"Better for correlated features\",\n       x=\"Feature\", y=\"Conditional Importance\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conditional permutation importance addresses a key limitation of standard permutation importance: when features are correlated, permuting one feature can break realistic feature relationships, leading to importance estimates that don’t reflect the true contribution of the feature.\n\n\nPractical Comparison Across Methods\nTo illustrate when different methods provide complementary insights, let’s compare them on a dataset with interactions and non-linear effects:\n\n# Create data with clear interaction and non-linear effect\nset.seed(789)\nn &lt;- 1000\nx1 &lt;- runif(n, -2, 2)\nx2 &lt;- runif(n, -2, 2)\nx3 &lt;- runif(n, -2, 2)\nx4 &lt;- rnorm(n)  # Noise variable\n\n# Complex relationship: non-linear in x1, interaction between x1 and x2\ny &lt;- sin(2*x1) + x1*x2 + 0.5*x3^2 + rnorm(n, sd=0.3)\n\ndata_complex &lt;- data.frame(y, x1, x2, x3, x4)\n\n# Train gradient boosting model\nlibrary(xgboost)\ndtrain &lt;- xgb.DMatrix(data=as.matrix(data_complex[,-1]), \n                      label=data_complex$y)\nxgb_model &lt;- xgb.train(\n  data=dtrain,\n  nrounds=100,\n  params=list(objective=\"reg:squarederror\", \n              max_depth=5, eta=0.1),\n  verbose=0\n)\n\n# 1.

SHAP offers theoretically grounded local and global importance, PDPs reveal functional relationships, and ICE plots show instance-level heterogeneity. In practice, using multiple methods provides more complete understanding than relying on any single approach.\n\n\nThe Imperative for Explainability\nThe demand for explainability stems from multiple sources, each with distinct requirements and motivations. In regulated industries, explainability is often a legal requirement. The European Union’s GDPR includes provisions for algorithmic transparency, requiring that individuals affected by automated decisions receive meaningful information about the logic involved. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act in the United States mandates that financial institutions provide specific reasons for adverse credit decisions. Healthcare applications face similar regulatory scrutiny, where the FDA increasingly requires evidence of interpretability for AI-assisted diagnostic tools.\nTrust and adoption present another critical dimension. Medical practitioners are unlikely to rely on diagnostic systems they don’t understand, regardless of their accuracy. A radiologist examining a potential tumor needs to see which image features led to the model’s assessment, allowing them to combine algorithmic insights with their clinical expertise. Financial advisors similarly require explanations to justify investment recommendations to clients and comply with fiduciary duties. In these contexts, explainability is not merely desirable but essential for practical deployment.\nDebugging and model improvement benefit significantly from interpretability tools. When a model fails on certain types of inputs, understanding its decision-making process helps identify the root cause. Is the model relying on spurious correlations? Has it learned dataset biases? Are certain features being misinterpreted? Explainability methods allow practitioners to diagnose these issues and refine their models accordingly. The famous case of the “wolf detector” that was actually detecting snow backgrounds (ribeiro2016why?) illustrates how explanations can reveal that models learn unexpected patterns.\nFairness and bias detection represent another crucial application of explainability. When models exhibit disparate performance across demographic groups, understanding which features drive predictions helps identify sources of bias. If a hiring model heavily weights features correlated with protected attributes, explanations can surface these problematic dependencies, enabling corrective action through feature engineering, reweighting, or architectural changes.\nScientific discovery increasingly relies on machine learning models that identify patterns humans might miss. In drug discovery, models that predict molecular properties need to be interpretable to generate scientific insights about structure-activity relationships (jimenez2020drugex?). Climate models, protein folding predictions (jumper2021highly?), and materials science applications all benefit from understanding not just what the model predicts, but why it makes those predictions, as these explanations can suggest new hypotheses and research directions.\n\n\nThe Paradox of Understanding and Utility\nThe insistence on full explanatory understanding before deploying useful tools, however, represents a historically unusual stance. Many of our most valuable scientific and medical technologies were adopted and saved lives long before we fully understood their mechanisms.\nConsider mammography, one of the most important breast cancer screening tools developed in the 20th century. Mammograms began widespread use in the 1960s and 1970s, and large-scale trials in the 1970s and 1980s demonstrated clear mortality reduction in screened populations (shapiro1988selection?) (tabar1985reduction?). Yet our understanding of breast cancer biology, tumor heterogeneity, and the precise mechanisms by which early detection improves outcomes continued to evolve for decades afterward. We still grapple with questions about optimal screening intervals, the balance of benefits and harms, and which tumors are truly aggressive versus indolent. The initial adoption was based on empirical evidence of benefit, not complete mechanistic understanding. The lack of complete explanation did not prevent mammography from saving countless lives.\nSimilarly, many pharmaceutical interventions were discovered through empirical observation long before their mechanisms were understood. Aspirin was used for decades before we understood its inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes. Lithium became a treatment for bipolar disorder in the 1940s, but its precise mechanism of action remains incompletely understood. Anesthesia was used successfully for over 150 years before we developed adequate theories of how it works. In each case, careful empirical validation preceded mechanistic understanding, and the lack of explanation did not preclude tremendous benefit.\nEngineering provides equally striking examples. The Navier-Stokes equations, which describe fluid flow and form the foundation of aerodynamics, weather prediction, and countless other applications, were formulated in the 19th century. We use numerical solutions to these equations daily for critical applications: designing aircraft, predicting hurricanes, optimizing turbine efficiency, and modeling blood flow in cardiovascular research. Yet one of the Clay Mathematics Institute’s Millennium Prize Problems, offering a million-dollar prize, asks whether solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations even exist and are unique in three dimensions (fefferman2006existence?). We have built an entire technological civilization on equations whose mathematical foundations remain unproven. Engineers successfully use these equations not through complete mathematical understanding but through empirical validation, computational approximation, and careful attention to when the models work well and when they fail.\nThis historical pattern suggests a more nuanced view of explainability in machine learning. The demand that we fully understand and explain every prediction from a neural network before deploying it represents a higher standard than we have applied to many successful technologies. This is not to argue against explainability research—it is valuable and important. Rather, it suggests that we should focus on:\nEmpirical validation through rigorous testing, cross-validation, and real-world performance monitoring. A model that consistently makes accurate predictions on held-out test sets and in production may be deployable even if we cannot fully explain every decision.\nUnderstanding failure modes rather than complete mechanistic understanding. Knowing when and where a model is likely to fail, what types of inputs it handles poorly, and how confident it is in its predictions may be more actionable than detailed explanations of every prediction.\nComplementary human oversight in high-stakes decisions. Rather than requiring complete explainability, we might deploy powerful but less interpretable models in systems where humans remain in the loop, using model predictions as one input among many.\nAppropriate deployment contexts that match interpretability requirements to stakes and alternatives. A model that routes customer service calls can reasonably be less interpretable than one making parole decisions. The comparison should be to existing alternatives: is the model more or less fair, accurate, and interpretable than current practice?\nThe goal is not to abandon explainability but to maintain perspective. History suggests that empirically validated tools often precede complete understanding, and this gap need not prevent their careful deployment. As we develop more sophisticated explainability methods, we should simultaneously develop more sophisticated frameworks for when and why explanation is necessary, recognizing that the relationship between understanding and utility is subtle and context-dependent.\nThis balanced view—pursuing explainability while acknowledging the historical precedent for useful tools that outpace understanding—may lead to more productive deployment of machine learning in domains where it can provide real benefit, accompanied by the monitoring, validation, and human oversight appropriate to the stakes involved.\n\n\n\n\nBahdanau, Dzmitry, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014. “Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate.” arXiv. https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473.\n\n\nImmer, Alexander, Matthias Bauer, Vincent Fortuin, Gunnar Rätsch, and Khan Mohammad Emtiyaz. 2021. “Scalable Marginal Likelihood Estimation for Model Selection in Deep Learning.” In International Conference on Machine Learning, 4563–73.

This chapter explores how these seemingly distinct methodologies converge in modern AI theory, particularly through the lens of regularization and model selection.\nMaximum likelihood estimation represents the cornerstone of classical statistical inference. Given observed data \\(\\mathcal{D} = (x_i, y_i)_{i=1}^n\\) and a parametric model \\(f_{\\theta}(x)\\), the MLE principle seeks to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function: \\[\n\\hat{\\theta}_{MLE} = \\arg\\max_{\\theta} \\mathcal{L}(\\theta; \\mathcal{D}) = \\arg\\max_{\\theta} \\prod_{i=1}^n p(y_i | x_i, \\theta)\n\\]\nThis approach has several appealing properties: it provides consistent estimators under mild conditions, achieves the Cramér-Rao lower bound asymptotically, and offers a principled framework for parameter estimation. However, MLE has well-documented limitations, particularly in high-dimensional settings. MLE can lead to overfitting, poor generalization, and numerical instability. Furthermore, as shown by Stein’s paradox, MLE can be inadmissible, meaning there are other estimators that have lower risk than the MLE. We will start this chapter with the normal means problem and demonstrate how MLE can be inadmissible.\nConsider the vector of means case where \\(\\theta = (\\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_p)\\). We have \\[\n\\bar y_i \\mid \\theta_i \\sim N(\\theta_i, \\sigma^2), \\quad i=1,\\ldots,p, \\quad p &gt; 2\n\\tag{18.1}\\] Here \\(\\bar y_i\\) is the mean of \\(n_i\\) observations, i.e., \\(\\bar y_i = \\frac{1}{n_i} \\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} y_{ij}\\).\nThe goal is to estimate the vector of means \\(\\theta = (\\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_p)\\), and we can achieve this by borrowing strength across the observations. This is also a proxy for non-parametric regression, where \\(\\theta_i = f(x_i)\\). Much has been written on the properties of the Bayes risk as a function of \\(n\\) and \\(p\\), and extensive work has been done on the asymptotic properties of the Bayes risk as \\(n\\) and \\(p\\) grow to infinity.\nThe classical inference is based on the CLT \\[\n\\hat \\theta_i \\mid \\theta_i \\sim N(\\theta_i, \\sigma^2/n_i),\n\\] and the MLE estimate is given by: \\[\n\\hat \\theta_i = \\bar y_i.\n\\] The MLE estimate is consistent and asymptotically normal, i.e., \\[\n\\hat \\theta_i \\to N(\\theta_i, \\sigma^2/n_i) \\quad \\text{as} \\quad n_i \\to \\infty.\n\\]\nOn the other hand, the Bayes estimator is based on \\(\\theta_i \\mid \\hat \\theta_i\\), where \\(\\hat \\theta_i = \\bar y_i\\). In other words, the classical approach is subject to the prosecutor’s fallacy. Classical estimators are unbiased, whereas Bayes estimator is biased.\nThe goal is to estimate the vector \\(\\theta\\) using squared loss: \\[\n\\mathcal{L}(\\theta, \\hat{\\theta}) = \\sum_{i=1}^p (\\theta_i - \\hat{\\theta}_i)^2,\n\\] where \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is the vector of estimates. We will compare the MLE estimate with the James-Stein estimate. A principled way to evaluate the performance of an estimator is to average its loss over the data; this metric is called the risk. The MLE estimate \\(\\hat{\\theta}_i = y_i\\) has a constant risk \\(p\\sigma^2\\): \\[\nR(\\theta,\\hat{\\theta}) = \\E[y]{\\mathcal{L}(\\theta, \\hat{\\theta})} = \\sum_{i=1}^p \\E[y_i]{(y_i - \\theta_i )^2}.\n\\]\nHere the expectation is over the data given by distribution Equation 18.1 and \\(y_i \\sim N(\\theta_i, \\sigma^2)\\), we have \\(\\E[y_i]{(\\theta_i - y_i)^2} = \\Var{y_i} = \\sigma^2\\) for each \\(i\\). Therefore: \\[\nR(\\theta,\\hat{\\theta}) = \\sum_{i=1}^p \\sigma^2 = p\\sigma^2.\n\\]\nThis shows that the MLE risk is constant and does not depend on the true parameter values \\(\\theta\\), only on the dimension \\(p\\) and the noise variance \\(\\sigma^2\\).\nBayesian inference offers a fundamentally different perspective by incorporating prior knowledge and quantifying uncertainty through probability distributions. The Bayesian approach begins with a prior distribution \\(p(\\theta)\\) over the parameter space and updates this belief using Bayes’ rule: \\[\np(\\theta | y) = \\frac{p(y | \\theta) p(\\theta)}{p(y)}\n\\]\nThe Bayes estimator is the value \\(\\hat{\\theta}^{B}\\) that minimizes the Bayes risk, the expected loss: \\[\n\\hat{\\theta}^{B} = \\arg\\min_{\\hat{\\theta}(y)} R(\\pi, \\hat{\\theta}(y))\n\\] Here \\(\\pi\\) is the prior distribution of \\(\\theta\\) and \\(R(\\pi, \\hat{\\theta}(y))\\) is the Bayes risk defined as: \\[\nR(\\pi, \\hat{\\theta}(y)) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\theta \\sim \\pi} \\left[ \\mathbb{E}_{y\\mid \\theta} \\left[ \\mathcal{L}(\\theta, \\hat{\\theta}(y)) \\right] \\right].\n\\tag{18.2}\\] For squared error loss, this yields the posterior mean \\(\\E{\\theta \\mid y}\\), while for absolute error loss, it gives the posterior median.\nFor the normal means problem with squared error loss, this becomes: \\[\nR(\\pi, \\hat{\\theta}(y)) = \\int_{\\theta \\in \\Theta} \\left( \\int_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}} (\\theta - \\hat{\\theta}(y))^2 p(y|\\theta) dy \\right) \\pi(\\theta) d\\theta\n\\]\nThe Bayes risk quantifies the expected performance of an estimator, taking into account both the uncertainty in the data and the prior uncertainty about the parameter. It serves as a benchmark for comparing different estimators: an estimator with lower Bayes risk is preferred under the chosen prior and loss function. In particular, the Bayes estimator achieves the minimum possible Bayes risk for the given prior and loss.\nIn 1961, James and Stein exhibited an estimator of the mean of a multivariate normal distribution that has uniformly lower mean squared error than the sample mean. This estimator is reviewed briefly in an empirical Bayes context. Stein’s rule and its generalizations are then applied to predict baseball averages, to estimate toxoplasmosis prevalence rates, and to estimate the exact size of Pearson’s chi-square test with results from a computer simulation.\nIn each of these examples, the mean squared error of these rules is less than half that of the sample mean. This result is paradoxical because it contradicts the elementary law of statistical theory. The philosophical implications of Stein’s paradox are also significant. It has influenced the development of shrinkage estimators and has connections to Bayesianism and model selection criteria.\nStein’s phenomenon where \\(y_i \\mid \\theta_i \\sim N(\\theta_i, 1)\\) and \\(\\theta_i \\sim N(0, \\tau^2)\\) where \\(\\tau \\rightarrow \\infty\\) illustrates this point well. The MLE approach is equivalent to the use of the improper “non-informative” uniform prior and leads to an estimator with poor risk properties.\nLet \\(\\|y\\| = \\sum_{i=1}^p y_i^2\\). Then, we can make the following probabilistic statements from the model: \\[\nP\\left( \\| y \\| &gt; \\| \\theta \\| \\right) &gt; \\frac{1}{2}\n\\] Now for the posterior, this inequality is reversed under a flat Lebesgue measure: \\[\nP\\left( \\| \\theta \\| &gt; \\| y \\| \\mid y \\right) &gt; \\frac{1}{2}\n\\] which is in conflict with the classical statement. This is a property of the prior which leads to a poor rule (the overall average) and risk.\nThe shrinkage rule (a.k.a. normal prior) where \\(\\tau^2\\) is “estimated” from the data avoids this conflict. More precisely, we have: \\[\n\\hat{\\theta}(y) = \\left( 1 - \\frac{k-2}{\\|y\\|^2} \\right) y \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\E{\\| \\hat{\\theta} - \\theta \\| } &lt; k, \\; \\forall \\theta.\n\\] Hence, when \\(\\|y\\|^2\\) is small, the shrinkage factor is more extreme. For example, if \\(k=10\\), \\(\\|y\\|^2=12\\), then \\(\\hat{\\theta} = (1/3) y\\). Now we have the more intuitive result that: \\[\nP\\left(\\|\\theta\\| &gt; \\|y\\| \\mid y\\right) &lt; \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]\nThis shows that careful specification of default priors matters in high dimensions.\nThe resulting estimator is called the James-Stein estimator and is a shrinkage estimator that shrinks the MLE towards the prior mean. The prior mean is typically the sample mean of the data. The James-Stein estimator is given by: \\[\n\\hat{\\theta}_{i}^{JS} = (1 - \\lambda) \\hat{\\theta}_{i}^{MLE} + \\lambda \\bar{y},\n\\] where \\(\\lambda\\) is a shrinkage parameter and \\(\\bar{y}\\) is the sample mean of the data. The shrinkage parameter is typically chosen to minimize the risk of the estimator.\nThe key idea behind James-Stein shrinkage is that one can “borrow strength” across components. In this sense, the multivariate parameter estimation problem is easier than the univariate one.\nFollowing Efron and Morris (1975), we can view the James-Stein estimator through the lens of empirical Bayes methodology. Efron and Morris demonstrate that Stein’s seemingly paradoxical result has a natural interpretation when viewed as an empirical Bayes procedure that estimates the prior distribution from the data itself.\nConsider the hierarchical model: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_i \\mid \\theta_i &\\sim N(\\theta_i, \\sigma^2) \\\\\n\\theta_i \\mid \\mu, \\tau^2 &\\sim N(\\mu, \\tau^2)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe marginal distribution of \\(y_i\\) is then \\(y_i \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2 + \\tau^2)\\). In the empirical Bayes approach, we estimate the hyperparameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\tau^2\\) from the marginal likelihood:\n\\[\nm(y \\mid \\mu, \\tau^2) = \\prod_{i=1}^p \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi(\\sigma^2 + \\tau^2)}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y_i - \\mu)^2}{2(\\sigma^2 + \\tau^2)}\\right)\n\\]\nThe maximum marginal likelihood estimators are: \\[\n\\hat{\\mu} = \\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{p}\\sum_{i=1}^p y_i\n\\] \\[\n\\hat{\\tau}^2 = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{1}{p}\\sum_{i=1}^p (y_i - \\bar{y})^2 - \\sigma^2\\right)\n\\]\nThe empirical Bayes estimator then becomes: \\[\n\\hat{\\theta}_i^{EB} = \\frac{\\hat{\\tau}^2}{\\sigma^2 + \\hat{\\tau}^2} y_i + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sigma^2 + \\hat{\\tau}^2} \\hat{\\mu}\n\\]\nThis can be rewritten as: \\[\n\\hat{\\theta}_i^{EB} = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sigma^2 + \\hat{\\tau}^2}\\right) y_i + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sigma^2 + \\hat{\\tau}^2} \\bar{y}\n\\]\nWhen \\(\\mu = 0\\) and using the estimate \\(\\hat{\\tau}^2 = \\max(0, \\|y\\|^2/p - \\sigma^2)\\), this reduces to a form closely related to the James-Stein estimator: \\[\n\\hat{\\theta}_i^{JS} = \\left(1 - \\frac{(p-2)\\sigma^2}{\\|y\\|^2}\\right) y_i\n\\]\nEfron and Morris show that the empirical Bayes interpretation provides insight into why the James-Stein estimator dominates the MLE. The key insight is that the MLE implicitly assumes an improper flat prior \\(\\pi(\\theta) \\propto 1\\), which leads to poor risk properties in high dimensions.\nThe Bayes risk of the James-Stein estimator can be explicitly calculated due to the conjugacy of the normal prior and likelihood: \\[\nR(\\theta, \\hat{\\theta}^{JS}) = p\\sigma^2 - (p-2)\\sigma^2 \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\|\\theta + \\epsilon\\|^2/\\sigma^2}\\right]\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 I)\\). Since the second term is always positive, we have: \\[\nR(\\theta, \\hat{\\theta}^{JS}) &lt; R(\\theta, \\hat{\\theta}^{MLE}) \\quad \\forall \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^p, \\quad p \\geq 3\n\\]\nThis uniform domination demonstrates the inadmissibility of the MLE under squared error loss for \\(p \\geq 3\\).\nIn an applied problem, the gap in risk between MLE and JS estimators can be large. For example, in the normal means problem with \\(p=100\\) and \\(n=100\\), the risk of the MLE is \\(R(\\theta,\\hat{\\theta}_{MLE}) = 100\\) while the risk of the JS estimator is \\(R(\\theta,\\hat{\\theta}_{JS}) = 1.5\\). The JS estimator is 67 times more efficient than the MLE. The JS estimator is also minimax optimal in the sense that it attains the minimax risk bound for the normal means problem. The minimax risk bound is the smallest risk that can be attained by any estimator.\nThe James-Stein estimator illustrates how incorporating prior information (via shrinkage) can lead to estimators with lower overall risk compared to the MLE, especially in high-dimensional settings. However, it is not the only shrinkage estimator that dominates the MLE. Other shrinkage estimators, such as the ridge regression estimator, also have lower risk than the MLE. The key insight is that shrinkage estimators can leverage prior information to improve estimation accuracy, especially in high-dimensional settings.\nNote, that we used the empirical Bayes version of the definition of risk. Full Bayes approach incorporates both the data and the prior distribution of the parameter as in Equation 18.2.",

    "text": "Example 18.1 (Screening Corporate Performance) To illustrate the practical importance of the normal means problem, consider the challenge faced by investment analysts screening thousands of publicly traded companies for sustained superior performance (Polson and Scott 2012). Suppose we have return on assets (ROA) data for \\(p = 53,038\\) firms across 93 countries over 45 years. For each firm \\(i\\), we observe an average ROA performance \\(\\bar{y}_i\\) over some time period.\nThe fundamental question is: Which firms have genuinely superior performance versus those that appear successful due to luck? This is precisely a massive multiple testing problem in the normal means framework. Using MLE, we would estimate each firm’s performance as \\(\\hat{\\theta}_i = \\bar{y}_i\\) and declare any firm with \\(\\bar{y}_i &gt; 0\\) as superior. However, this approach ignores the massive multiplicity problem—with over 50,000 firms, many will appear successful purely by chance.\nThe Bayesian approach with appropriate shrinkage priors can distinguish between truly superior firms and those that are merely lucky. As we’ll see, this requires heavy-tailed priors that can accommodate the rare firms with genuine outperformance while shrinking the estimates of mediocre firms toward zero. This example demonstrates why the choice between MLE and Bayesian estimation has profound practical consequences in high-dimensional settings.\nIn practice, the normal means problem often requires careful preprocessing of the observed data. A common and crucial step is to normalize the observations by converting them to z-scores. This standardization serves multiple purposes and connects directly to the theoretical framework we’ve established.\nConsider our corporate performance example where we observe ROA values \\(\\bar{y}_i\\) for different firms. These firms may operate in different industries, countries, or time periods, making direct comparison problematic. Raw ROA values might range from -20% to +30%, with different scales and baseline expectations across sectors.\nThe z-score transformation standardizes each observation relative to a reference distribution: \\[\nz_i = \\frac{\\bar{y}_i - \\mu_i}{\\sigma_i}.\n\\] where \\(\\mu_i\\) and \\(\\sigma_i\\) represent the mean and standard deviation estimated and predicted by an autoregressive model.\nIn the Polson & Scott study (Polson and Scott 2012), standardization was essential for handling the massive heterogeneity across their dataset of 53,038 firms spanning 93 countries and 45 years. The authors faced three critical challenges that z-score normalization helped address:\n1. Cross-Country Comparisons: Raw ROA values varied dramatically across countries due to different accounting standards, economic conditions, and regulatory environments. A 5% ROA in Japan during the 1990s had very different implications than 5% ROA in Brazil during the same period.\n2. Temporal Adjustments: Economic cycles, inflation rates, and market conditions changed substantially over the 45-year study period. The authors needed to adjust for these time-varying factors to identify firms with genuinely superior performance rather than those that simply operated during favorable periods.\n3. Industry Heterogeneity: Different industries have fundamentally different ROA distributions. Technology firms typically show higher volatility and different baseline performance compared to utilities or manufacturing companies.\nThe authors implemented a sophisticated normalization procedure: \\[\nz_{i,t} = \\frac{\\text{ROA}_{i,t} - \\mu_{\\text{peer}(i),t}}{\\sigma_{\\text{peer}(i),t}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\text{peer}(i)\\) represents firm \\(i\\)’s reference group (defined by industry, country, and size), and the subscript \\(t\\) indicates time-varying adjustments. This created standardized performance measures where:\n\n\\(z_{i,t} = 0\\) indicates performance exactly at the peer group median\n\\(z_{i,t} = 1\\) indicates performance one standard deviation above peers\n\n\\(z_{i,t} = -1\\) indicates performance one standard deviation below peers\n\nCritical Finding: After this rigorous standardization, the authors discovered that sustained superior performance (\\(\\theta_i &gt; 0\\) consistently over time) was remarkably rare. Most firms showing high raw ROA were simply benefiting from favorable conditions rather than demonstrating genuine operational excellence. This finding emerged only after proper normalization—without standardization, hundreds of firms would have been incorrectly classified as superior performers.",

    "text": "18.2 Unbiasedness and the Optimality of Bayes Rules\nThe optimal Bayes rule \\(\\delta_\\pi(x) = \\E{\\theta \\mid y}\\) is the posterior mean under squared error loss. An interesting feature of the Bayes rule is that it is biased except in degenerate cases like improper priors, which can lose optimality properties. This can be seen using the following decomposition.\nIf the rule was unbiased, then the Bayes risk would be zero. This follows by contradiction: assume for the sake of argument that \\(\\E[x\\mid\\theta]{\\delta_{\\pi}(y)} = \\theta\\), then \\[\nr(\\pi, \\delta_{\\pi}(y)) = \\E[\\pi]{\\E[y\\mid\\theta]{(\\delta_{\\pi}(y) - \\theta)^2}} = \\E[\\pi]{\\theta^2} + \\E[y]{\\delta_{\\pi}(y)}^2 - 2\\E[\\pi]{\\theta \\E[y\\mid\\theta]{\\delta_{\\pi}(y)}} = 0\n\\] which is a contradiction since the Bayes risk cannot be zero in non-degenerate cases.\nThe key feature of Bayes rules is the bias-variance tradeoff inherent in their nature. You achieve a large reduction in variance for a small amount of bias. This is the underpinning of James-Stein estimation.\nAnother interesting feature is that the Bayes rule \\(\\E{\\theta \\mid y}\\) is always Bayes sufficient in the sense that \\[\n\\E[\\pi]{\\theta \\mid \\E[\\pi]{\\theta \\mid y}} = \\E[\\pi]{\\theta \\mid y}\n\\] So conditioning on \\(\\E[\\pi]{\\theta \\mid y}\\) is equivalent to conditioning on \\(y\\) when estimating \\(\\theta\\). This property is used in quantile neural network approaches to generative methods.\n\nExample 18.2 (Example: James-Stein for Baseball Batting Averages) We reproduce the baseball batting average example from Efron and Morris (1977).

This can be done by maximizing the marginal likelihood \\(m(y \\mid \\tau )\\) with respect to \\(\\tau\\). The resulting estimator is called the type II maximum likelihood estimator (MMLE). \\[\n\\hat{\\tau} = \\arg \\max_{\\tau} \\log m( y \\mid \\tau ).\n\\]\nFor example, in the normal-normal model, when \\(\\theta \\sim N(\\mu,\\tau^2)\\) with \\(\\mu=0\\), we can integrate out the high dimensional \\(\\theta\\) and find \\(m(y | \\tau)\\) in closed form as \\(y_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 + \\tau^2)\\) \\[\nm( y | \\tau ) = ( 2 \\pi)^{-n/2} ( \\sigma^2 + \\tau^2 )^{- n/2}  \\exp \\left ( - \\frac{ \\sum y_i^2 }{ 2 ( \\sigma^2 + \\tau^2) } \\right )\n\\] The original JS estimator shrinks to zero and estimates prior variance using empirical Bayes (marginal MLE or Type II MLE). Efron and Morris and Lindley showed that you want to shrink to overall mean \\(\\bar y\\) and in this approach \\[\n\\theta \\sim N(\\mu,\\tau^2).\n\\] The original JS is \\(\\mu=0\\). To estimate the \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\tau\\) you can do full Bayes or empirical Bayes that shrinks to overall grand mean \\(\\bar y\\), which serves as the estimate of the original prior mean \\(\\mu\\). It seems paradoxical that you estimate prior parameters from the data. However, this is not the case. You simply use mixture prior Diaconis and Ylvisaker (1983) with marginal MLE (MMLE). The MMLE is the product \\[\n\\int_{\\theta_i}\\prod_{i=1}^k p(\\bar y_i \\mid \\theta_i)p(\\theta_i \\mid \\mu, \\tau^2).\n\\]\nThe motivation for the shrinkage prior rather than a flat uniform prior are the following probabilistic arguments. They have an ability to balance signal detection and noise suppression in high-dimensional settings. Unlike flat uniform priors, shrinkage priors adaptively shrink small signals towards zero while preserving large signals. This behavior is crucial for sparse estimation problems, where most parameters are expected to be zero or near-zero. The James-Stein procedure is an example of global shrinkage, when the overall sparsity level across all parameters is controlled, ensuring that the majority of parameters are shrunk towards zero. Later in this section we will discuss local shrinkage priors, such as the horseshoe prior, which allow individual parameters to escape shrinkage if they represent significant signals.\nIn summary, flat uniform priors (MLE) fail to provide adequate regularization in high-dimensional settings, leading to poor risk properties and overfitting. By incorporating probabilistic arguments and hierarchical structures, shrinkage priors offer a principled approach to regularization that aligns with Bayesian decision theory and modern statistical practice.",

    "section": "18.3 Bias-Variance Decomposition",
    "text": "18.3 Bias-Variance Decomposition\nThe discussion of shrinkage priors and James-Stein estimation naturally leads us to a fundamental concept in statistical learning: the bias-variance decomposition. This decomposition provides the theoretical foundation for understanding why shrinkage methods like James-Stein can outperform maximum likelihood estimation, even when they introduce bias.\nThe key insight is that estimation error can be decomposed into two components: bias (systematic error) and variance (random error). While unbiased estimators like maximum likelihood have zero bias, they often suffer from high variance, especially in high-dimensional settings. Shrinkage methods intentionally introduce a small amount of bias to achieve substantial reductions in variance, leading to better overall performance.\nThis trade-off between bias and variance is not just a theoretical curiosity—it’s the driving force behind many successful machine learning algorithms, from ridge regression to neural networks with dropout. Understanding this decomposition helps us make principled decisions about model complexity and regularization.\nFor parameter estimation, we can decompose the mean squared error as follows: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\E{(\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta)^2} &= \\E{(\\hat{\\theta} - \\E{\\hat{\\theta}} + \\E{\\hat{\\theta}} - \\theta)^2} \\\\\n&= \\E{(\\hat{\\theta} - \\E{\\hat{\\theta}})^2} + \\E{(\\E{\\hat{\\theta}} - \\theta)^2} \\\\\n&= \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}) + \\text{Bias}(\\hat{\\theta})^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] The cross term has expectation zero.\nFor prediction problems, we have \\(y = \\theta + \\epsilon\\) where \\(\\epsilon\\) is independent with \\(\\text{Var}(\\epsilon) = \\sigma^2\\). Hence \\[\n\\E{(y - \\hat{y})^2} = \\sigma^2 + \\E{(\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta)^2}\n\\]\nThis decomposition shows that prediction error consists of irreducible noise, estimation variance, and estimation bias. Bayesian methods typically trade a small increase in bias for a substantial reduction in variance, leading to better overall performance.\nThe bias-variance decomposition provides a framework for understanding estimation error, but it doesn’t tell us how to construct optimal estimators. To find the best decision rule—whether for estimation, hypothesis testing, or model selection—we need a more general framework that can handle different types of loss functions and prior information. This leads us to Bayesian decision theory and the concept of risk decomposition.\n\nRisk Decomposition\nHow does one find an optimal decision rule? It could be a test region, an estimation procedure or the selection of a model. Bayesian decision theory addresses this issue.\nThe a posteriori Bayes risk approach is as follows. Let \\(\\delta(x)\\) denote the decision rule. Given the prior \\(\\pi(\\theta)\\), we can simply calculate \\[\nR_n  ( \\pi , \\delta ) = \\int_x m( x )  \\left \\{ \\int_\\Theta \\mathcal{L}( \\theta , \\delta(x) )  p( \\theta | x ) d \\theta \\right \\} d x .\n\\] Then the optimal Bayes rule is to pointwise minimize the inner integral (a.k.a. the posterior Bayes risk), namely \\[\n\\delta^\\star ( x ) = \\arg \\max_\\delta \\int_\\Theta \\mathcal{L}( \\theta , \\delta(x) )  p( \\theta | x ) d \\theta .\n\\] The caveat is that this gives us no intuition into the characteristics of the prior which are important. Moreover, we do not need the marginal beliefs \\(m(x)\\).\nFor example, under squared error estimation loss, the optimal estimator is simply the posterior mean, \\(\\delta^\\star (x)  = E( \\theta | x )\\).\nThe optimal Bayes rule \\(\\delta_\\pi( x ) = E( \\theta \\mid x )\\) is the posterior mean under squared error loss. An interesting feature of the Bayes rule is that it is biased (except in degenerate cases like improper priors which can lose optimality properties). This can be seen using the following decomposition. If the rule was unbiased then the Bayes risk would be zero. This follows, via contradiction, assume f.a.c. that \\(E_{ x| \\theta } ( \\delta_\\pi(x) ) = \\theta\\), then \\[\\begin{align*}\nr ( \\pi , \\delta_\\pi ( x ) ) & = E_{\\pi} \\left ( E_{ x| \\theta } ( \\delta_\\pi ( x ) - \\theta )^2 \\right ) \\\\\n& = E_\\pi ( \\theta^2 ) + E_x \\left ( \\delta_\\pi ( x )^2 \\right ) - 2 E_\\pi \\left ( \\theta E_{x | \\theta } ( \\delta_\\pi( x ) ) \\right ) \\\\\n& = 0\n\\end{align*}\\] which is a contradiction.\nThe key feature of Bayes rule then is the bias-variance trade-off inherent in their nature. You achieve a large reduction in variance for a small amount of bias. This is the underpinning of James-Stein estimation which we discuss later.\nAnother interesting feature, is that the Bayes rule \\(E(\\theta \\mid x )\\) is always Bayes sufficient in the sense that \\[\nE_\\pi \\left ( \\theta \\; | \\; E_\\pi(\\theta |x ) \\right ) = E_\\pi( \\theta |x )\n\\] So conditioning on \\(\\E[\\pi]{ \\theta \\mid x }\\) is equivalent to conditioning on \\(x\\) when estimating \\(\\theta\\). This is used in the quantile neural network approach to generative methods.",

    "text": "18.4 Sparsity\nLet the true parameter be sparse with the form \\(\\theta_p = \\left( \\sqrt{d/p}, \\ldots, \\sqrt{d/p}, 0, \\ldots, 0 \\right)\\). The problem of recovering a vector with many zero entries is called sparse signal recovery. The “ultra-sparse” or “nearly black” vector case occurs when \\(p_n\\), denoting the number of non-zero parameter values, satisfies \\(\\theta \\in l_0[p_n]\\), which denotes the set \\(\\#(\\theta_i \\neq 0) \\leq p_n\\) where \\(p_n = o(n)\\) and \\(p_n \\rightarrow \\infty\\) as \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\).\nHigh-dimensional predictor selection and sparse signal recovery are routine statistical and machine learning tasks and present a challenge for classical statistical methods. From a historical perspective, James-Stein (a.k.a. \\(\\ell_2\\)-regularization, Stein (1964)) is only a global shrinkage rule—in the sense that there are no local parameters to learn about sparsity—and has issues recovering sparse signals.\nJames-Stein is equivalent to the model: \\[\ny_i = \\theta_i + \\epsilon_i \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\theta_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\tau^2)\n\\] For the sparse \\(r\\)-spike problem, \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{JS}\\) performs poorly and we require a different rule. rather than using softmax For \\(\\theta_p\\) we have: \\[\n\\frac{p \\|\\theta\\|^2}{p + \\|\\theta\\|^2} \\leq R(\\hat{\\theta}^{JS}, \\theta_p) \\leq 2 + \\frac{p \\|\\theta\\|^2}{d + \\|\\theta\\|^2}.\n\\] This implies that \\(R(\\hat{\\theta}^{JS}, \\theta_p) \\geq (p/2)\\).\nIn the sparse case, a simple thresholding rule can beat MLE and JS when the signal is sparse. Assuming \\(\\sigma^2 = 1\\), the thresholding estimator is: \\[\n\\hat{\\theta}_{thr} = \\begin{cases}\n\\hat{\\theta}_i & \\text{if } \\hat{\\theta}_i &gt; \\sqrt{2 \\ln p} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\] This simple example shows that the choice of penalty should not be taken for granted as different estimators will have different risk profiles.\nA horseshoe (HS) prior is another example of a shrinkage prior that inherits good MSE properties but also simultaneously provides asymptotic minimax estimation risk for sparse signals.\nOne such estimator that achieves the optimal minimax rate is the horseshoe estimator proposed by Carvalho, Polson, and Scott (2010). It is a local shrinkage estimator. The horseshoe prior is particularly effective for sparse signals, as it allows for strong shrinkage of noise while preserving signals. The horseshoe prior is defined as: \\[\n\\theta_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 \\tau^2 \\lambda_i^2), \\quad \\lambda_i \\sim C^+(0, 1), \\quad \\tau \\sim C^+(0, 1)\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\lambda_i\\) is a local shrinkage parameter, and \\(\\tau\\) is a global shrinkage parameter. The half-Cauchy distribution \\(C^+\\) ensures heavy tails, allowing for adaptive shrinkage. We will discuss the horseshoe prior in more detail later in this section.\nHS estimator uniformly dominates the traditional sample mean estimator in MSE and has good posterior concentration properties for nearly black objects. Specifically, the horseshoe estimator attains asymptotically minimax risk rate \\[\n\\sup_{ \\theta \\in l_0[p_n] } \\;\n\\mathbb{E}_{ y | \\theta } \\|\\hat y_{hs} - \\theta \\|^2 \\asymp\np_n \\log \\left ( n / p_n \\right ).\n\\] The “worst’’ \\(\\theta\\) is obtained at the maximum difference between \\(\\left| \\hat \\theta_{HS} - y \\right|\\) where \\(\\hat \\theta_{HS} = \\mathbb{E}(\\theta|y)\\) can be interpreted as a Bayes posterior mean (optimal under Bayes MSE).",

    "text": "18.5 Maximum A posteriori Estimation (MAP) and Regularization\nIn the previous sections, we have seen how the Bayesian approach provides a principled framework for parameter estimation through the use of prior distributions and the minimization of Bayes risk. However, in many practical scenarios, we may not have access to a full Bayesian model or the computational resources to perform Bayesian inference. This is where the concept of MAP or regularization comes into play. It also sometimes called a poor man’s Bayesian approach.\nGiven input-output pairs \\((x_i,y_i)\\), MAP learns the function \\(f\\) that maps inputs \\(x_i\\) to outputs \\(y_i\\) by minimizing \\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^N  \\mathcal{L}(y_i,f(x_i)) + \\lambda \\phi(f) \\rightarrow \\text{minimize}_{f}.\n\\] The first term is the loss function that measures the difference between the predicted output \\(f(x_i)\\) and the true output \\(y_i\\). The second term is a regularization term that penalizes complex functions \\(f\\) to prevent overfitting. The parameter \\(\\lambda\\) controls the trade-off between fitting the data well and keeping the function simple. In the case when \\(f\\) is a parametric model, then we simply replace \\(f\\) with the parameters \\(\\theta\\) of the model, and the regularization term becomes a penalty on the parameters.\nThe loss is simply a negative log-likelihood from a probabilistic model specified for the data generating process. For example, when \\(y\\) is numeric and \\(y_i \\mid x_i \\sim N(f(x_i),\\sigma^2)\\), we get the squared loss \\(\\mathcal{L}(y,f(x)) = (y-f(x))^2\\). When \\(y_i\\in \\{0,1\\}\\) is binary, we use the logistic loss \\(\\mathcal{L}(y,f(x)) = \\log(1+\\exp(-yf(x)))\\).\nThe penalty term \\(\\lambda \\phi(f)\\) discourages complex functions \\(f\\). Then, we can think of regularization as a technique to incorporate some prior knowledge about parameters of the model into the estimation process. Consider an example when regularization allows us to solve a hard problem of filtering noisy traffic data.\n\nExample 18.3 (Traffic) Consider traffic flow speed measured by an in-ground sensor installed on interstate I-55 near Chicago. Speed measurements are noisy and prone to have outliers. Figure 18.1 shows measured speed data, averaged over five minute intervals on one of the weekdays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.1: Speed profile over 24 hour period on I-55, on October 22, 2013\n\n\n\nThe statistical model is \\[\ny_t = f_t + \\epsilon_t, ~ \\epsilon_t \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2), ~ t=1,\\ldots,n,\n\\] where \\(y_t\\) is the speed measurement at time \\(t\\), \\(f_t\\) is the true underlying speed at time \\(t\\), and \\(\\epsilon_t\\) is the measurement noise. There are two sources of noise. The first is the measurement noise, caused by the inherent nature of the sensor’s hardware. The second source is due to sampling error, vehicles observed on a specific lane where the sensor is installed might not represent well traffic in other lanes. A naive MLE approach would be to estimate the speed profile \\(f = (f_1, \\ldots, f_n)\\) by minimizing the squared loss \\[\n\\hat f = \\arg\\min_{f} \\sum_{t=1}^{n} (y_t - f_t)^2.\n\\] However, the minima of this loss function is 0 and corresponds to the case when \\(\\hat f_t = y_t\\) for all \\(t\\). We have learned nothing about the speed profile, and the estimate is simply the noisy observation \\(y_t\\). In this case, we have no way to distinguish between the true speed profile and the noise.\nHowever, we can use regularization and bring some prior knowledge about traffic speed profiles to improve the estimate of the speed profile and to remove the noise.\nSpecifically, we will use a trend filtering approach. Under this approach, we assume that the speed profile \\(f\\) is a piece-wise linear function of time, and we want to find a function that captures the underlying trend while ignoring the noise. The regularization term \\(\\phi(f)\\) is then the second difference of the speed profile, \\[\n\\lambda \\sum_{t=1}^{n-1}|f_{t-1} - 2f_t + f_{t+1}|\n\\] which penalizes the “kinks” in the speed profile. The value of this penalty is zero, when \\(f_{t-1}, f_t, f_{t+1}\\) lie on a straight line, and it increases when the speed profile has a kink. The parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is a regularization parameter that controls the strength of the penalty.\nTrend filtering penalized function is then \\[\n(1/2) \\sum_{t=1}^{n}(y_t - f_t)^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{t=1}^{n-1}|f_{t-1} - 2f_t + f_{t+1}|,\n\\] which is a variation of a well-known Hodrick-Prescott filter.\nThis approach requires us to choose the regularization parameter \\(\\lambda\\). A small value of \\(\\lambda\\) will lead to a function that fits the data well, but may not capture the underlying trend. A large value of \\(\\lambda\\) will lead to a function that captures the underlying trend, but may not fit the data well. The optimal value of \\(\\lambda\\) can be chosen using cross-validation or other model selection techniques. The left panel of Figure 18.2 shows the trend filtering for different values of \\(\\lambda \\in \\{5,50,500\\}\\). The right panel shows the optimal value of \\(\\lambda\\) chosen by cross-validation (by visual inspection).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrend filter for different penalty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrend filtering with optimal penalty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.2: Trend Filtering for Traffic Speed Data",

For example, \\(l(x)\\) may be tied to the data, and \\(\\phi(x)\\) to the intrinsic cost associated with the decision.\n\nMAP as a Poor Man’s Bayesian\nThere is a duality between using regularization term in optimization problem and assuming a prior distribution over the parameters of the model \\(f\\).

    "text": "18.7 Ridge Regression (\\(\\ell_2\\) Norm)\nThe ridge regression uses a Gaussian prior on the parameters of the model \\(f\\), which leads to a squared penalty term. Specifically, we assume that the parameters \\(\\beta\\) of the model \\(f(x) = x^T\\beta\\) are distributed as: \\[\n\\beta \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 I),\n\\] where \\(I\\) is the identity matrix. The prior distribution of \\(\\beta\\) is a multivariate normal distribution with mean 0 and covariance \\(\\sigma^2 I\\). The negative log of this prior distribution is given by: \\[\n-\\log p(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\|\\beta\\|_2^2 + \\text{const},\n\\] where \\(\\|\\beta\\|_2^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j^2\\) is the squared 2-norm of the vector \\(\\beta\\). The regularization term \\(\\phi(f)\\) is then given by: \\[\n\\phi(f) = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\|\\beta\\|_2^2.  \n\\] This leads to the following optimization problem: \\[\n\\underset{\\beta}{\\mathrm{minimize}}\\quad \\|y- X\\beta\\|_2^2 + \\lambda \\|\\beta\\|_2^2,\n\\] where \\(\\lambda = 1/\\sigma^2\\) is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of the prior. The solution to this optimization problem is given by: \\[\n\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{ridge}} = ( X^T X + \\lambda I )^{-1} X^T y.\n\\] The regularization parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is related to the variance of the prior distribution. When \\(\\lambda=0\\), the function \\(f\\) is the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters. When \\(\\lambda\\) is large, the function \\(f\\) is the prior mean of the parameters. When \\(\\lambda\\) is infinite, the function \\(f\\) is the prior mode of the parameters.\nNotice, that the OLS estimate (invented by Gauss) is a special case of ridge regression when \\(\\lambda = 0\\): \\[\n\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{OLS}} = ( X^T X )^{-1} X^T y.\n\\]\nThe original motivation for ridge regularization was to address the problem of numerical instability in the OLS solution when the design matrix \\(X\\) is ill-conditioned, i.e. when \\(X^T X\\) is close to singular. In this case, the OLS solution can be very sensitive to small perturbations in the data, leading to large variations in the estimated coefficients \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\). This is particularly problematic when the number of features \\(p\\) is large, as the condition number of \\(X^T X\\) can grow rapidly with \\(p\\). The ridge regression solution stabilizes the OLS solution by adding a small positive constant \\(\\lambda\\) to the diagonal of the \\(X^T X\\) matrix, which improves the condition number and makes the solution more robust to noise in the data. The additional term \\(\\lambda I\\) simply shifts the eigenvalues of \\(X^T X\\) away from zero, thus improving the numerical stability of the inversion.\nAnother way to think and write the objective function of Ridge as the following constrained optimization problem: \\[\n\\underset{\\beta}{\\mathrm{minimize}}\\quad \\|y- X\\beta\\|_2^2 \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\|\\beta\\|_2^2 \\leq t,\n\\] where \\(t\\) is a positive constant that controls the size of the coefficients \\(\\beta\\). This formulation emphasizes the idea that ridge regression is a form of regularization that constrains the size of the coefficients, preventing them from growing too large and leading to overfitting. The constraint \\(\\|\\beta\\|_2^2 \\leq t\\) can be interpreted as a budget on the size of the coefficients, where larger values of \\(t\\) allow for larger coefficients and more complex models.\nConstraint on the model parameters (and the original Ridge estimator) was proposed by Tikhonov et al. (1943) for solving inverse problems to “discover” physical laws from observations. The norm of the \\(\\beta\\) vector would usually represent amount of energy required. Many processes in nature are energy minimizing!\nAgain, the tuning parameter \\(\\lambda\\) controls trade-off between how well model fits the data and how small \\(\\beta\\)s are. Different values of \\(\\lambda\\) will lead to different models. We select \\(\\lambda\\) using cross validation.\n\nExample 18.4 (Shrinkage) Consider a simulated data with \\(n=50\\), \\(p=30\\), and \\(\\sigma^2=1\\). The true model is linear with \\(10\\) large coefficients between \\(0.5\\) and \\(1\\).\nOur approximators \\(\\hat f_{\\beta}\\) is a linear regression. We can empirically calculate the bias by calculating the empirical squared loss \\(1/n\\|y -\\hat y\\|_2^2\\) and variance can be empirically calculated as \\(1/n\\sum  (\\bar{\\hat{y}} - \\hat y_i)^2\\)\nBias squared \\(\\mathrm{Bias}(\\hat{y})^2=0.006\\) and variance \\(\\Var{\\hat{y}} =0.627\\). Thus, the prediction error = \\(1 + 0.006 + 0.627 = 1.633\\)\nWe’ll do better by shrinking the coefficients to reduce the variance. Let’s estimate, how big a gain will we get with Ridge?\n\n\n\nTrue model coefficients\n\n\nNow we see the accuracy of the model as a function of \\(\\lambda\\)\n\n\n\nPrediction error as a function of \\(\\lambda\\)\n\n\nRidge Regression At best: Bias squared \\(=0.077\\) and variance \\(=0.402\\).\nPrediction error = \\(1 + 0.077 + 0.403 = 1.48\\)\n\n\n\nRidge\n\n\n\n\nKernel View of Ridge Regression\nAnother interesting view stems from what is called the push-through matrix identity: \\[\n(aI + UV)^{-1}U = U(aI + VU)^{-1}\n\\] for \\(a\\), \\(U\\), \\(V\\) such that the products are well-defined and the inverses exist. We can obtain this from \\(U(aI + VU) = (aI + UV)U\\), followed by multiplication by \\((aI + UV)^{-1}\\) on the left and the right. Applying the identity above to the ridge regression solution with \\(a = \\lambda\\), \\(U = X^T\\), and \\(V = X\\), we obtain an alternative form for the ridge solution: \\[\n\\hat{\\beta} = X^T (XX^T + \\lambda I)^{-1} Y.\n\\] This is often referred to as the kernel form of the ridge estimator. From this, we can see that the ridge fit can be expressed as \\[\nX\\hat{\\beta} = XX^T (XX^T + \\lambda I)^{-1} Y.\n\\] What does this remind you of? This is precisely \\(K(K + \\lambda I)^{-1}Y\\) where \\(K = XX^T\\), which, recall, is the fit from RKHS regression with a linear kernel \\(k(x, z) = x^T z\\). Therefore, we can think of RKHS regression as generalizing ridge regression by replacing the standard linear inner product with a general kernel. (Indeed, RKHS regression is often called kernel ridge regression.)",

The key insight is that many useful distributions can be represented as Gaussian distributions with random variance, leading to tractable MCMC algorithms and analytical insights.\n\nFundamental Integral Identities\nThe two key integral identities for hyperbolic/GIG and Pólya mixtures are: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\alpha^2 - \\kappa^2}{2\\alpha} e^{-\\alpha|\\theta - \\mu| + \\kappa(\\theta - \\mu)} &= \\int_0^\\infty \\phi\\left(\\theta \\mid \\mu + \\kappa\\omega, \\omega\\right) p_{\\text{gig}}\\left(\\omega \\mid 1, 0, \\sqrt{\\alpha^2 - \\kappa^2}\\right) d\\omega \\\\\n\\frac{1}{B(\\alpha,\\kappa)} \\frac{e^{\\alpha(\\theta - \\mu)}}{(1 + e^{\\theta - \\mu})^{2(\\alpha - \\kappa)}} &= \\int_0^\\infty \\phi\\left(\\theta \\mid \\mu + \\kappa\\omega, \\omega\\right) p_{\\text{pol}}(\\omega \\mid \\alpha, \\alpha - 2\\kappa) d\\omega\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(p_{\\text{pol}}\\) denotes the Pólya density and \\(p_{\\text{gig}}\\) the generalized inverse Gaussian.\n\n\nQuantile Regression Example\nTo illustrate these integral identities in practice, consider quantile regression. Start by choosing \\(q \\in (0,1)\\) and define the quantile loss function \\(l(x) = |x| + (2q-1)x\\). This is also known as the check loss or hinge loss function, and is used in quantile regression for the \\(q\\)th quantile Koenker (2005). Johannes, Polson, and Yae (2009) represent this as a pseudo-likelihood involving the asymmetric Laplace distribution.\nWe can derive the corresponding envelope representation as a variance-mean Gaussian mixture. Let \\(\\kappa = 2q-1\\). Then \\(g(x) = l(x) + \\kappa x = |x|\\) is symmetric in \\(x\\) and concave in \\(x^2\\). Using the general envelope representation framework, we obtain: \\[\nl(x) = \\inf_{\\lambda \\geq 0} \\left\\{ \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\left( x - \\frac{2q-1}{\\lambda} \\right)^2 - \\psi(\\lambda) \\right\\} \\, .\n\\] where \\(\\psi(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\kappa^2}{2\\lambda} - \\frac{1}{2 \\lambda^2}\\).\nThis representation shows how the asymmetric quantile loss can be expressed as an envelope of quadratic functions, connecting it to the Gaussian mixture framework and enabling efficient computational algorithms.\n\n\nImproper Limit Cases\nThese expressions lead to three important identities concerning improper limits of GIG and Pólya mixing measures for variance-mean Gaussian mixtures: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\na^{-1} \\exp\\left\\{-2c^{-1} \\max(a\\theta, 0)\\right\\} &= \\int_0^\\infty \\phi(\\theta \\mid -av, cv) dv \\\\\nc^{-1} \\exp\\left\\{-2c^{-1} \\rho_q(\\theta)\\right\\} &= \\int_0^\\infty \\phi(\\theta \\mid -(2\\tau - 1)v, cv) e^{-2\\tau(1-\\tau)v} dv \\\\\n(1 + \\exp\\{\\theta - \\mu\\})^{-1} &= \\int_0^\\infty \\phi(\\theta \\mid \\mu - \\frac{1}{2}v, v) p_{\\text{pol}}(v \\mid 0, 1) dv\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(\\rho_q(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}|\\theta| + (q - \\frac{1}{2})\\theta\\) is the check-loss function.\nThese representations connect to several important regression methods. The first identity relates to Support Vector Machines through the hinge loss in the max function. The second identity connects to Quantile and Lasso Regression via check-loss and \\(\\ell_1\\) penalties. The third identity provides the Logistic Regression representation.\nWith GIG and Pólya mixing distributions alone, one can generate the following objective functions: \\[\n\\theta^2, \\; |\\theta|, \\; \\max(\\theta,0), \\; \\frac{1}{2}|\\theta| + (\\tau - \\frac{1}{2})\\theta, \\; \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\theta}}, \\; \\frac{1}{(1+e^{-\\theta})^r}\n\\]\nThese correspond to ridge, lasso, support vector machine, check loss/quantile regression, logit, and multinomial models, respectively. More general families can generate other penalty functions—for example, the bridge penalty \\(|u|^\\alpha\\) from a stable mixing distribution.\n\n\nComputational Advantages\nThe scale mixture representation provides several computational benefits. Gibbs Sampling becomes efficient because the conditional distributions in the augmented parameter space are often conjugate, enabling tractable MCMC algorithms. EM Algorithms benefit from the E-step involving expectations with respect to the mixing distribution.\nThis framework has been instrumental in developing efficient algorithms for sparse regression, robust statistics, and non-conjugate Bayesian models. The ability to represent complex penalties as hierarchical Gaussian models bridges the gap between computational tractability and statistical flexibility.",

    "text": "18.9 Lasso Regression (\\(\\ell_1\\) Norm)\nThe Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression uses a Laplace prior on the parameters of the model \\(f\\), which leads to an \\(\\ell_1\\) penalty term. Specifically, we assume that the parameters \\(\\beta\\) of the model \\(f(x) = x^T\\beta\\) are distributed as: \\[\n\\beta_j \\sim \\text{Laplace}(0, b) \\quad \\text{independently for } j = 1, \\ldots, p,\n\\] where \\(b &gt; 0\\) is the scale parameter. The Laplace distribution has the probability density function: \\[\np(\\beta_j \\mid b) = \\frac{1}{2b}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|\\beta_j|}{b}\\right)\n\\] and is shown in Figure 18.3.\n\n\nCode\n# PLot Laplace distribution\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nb &lt;- 1\nbeta &lt;- seq(-5, 5, length.out = 100)\nlaplace_pdf &lt;- function(beta, b) {\n  (1/(2*b)) * exp(-abs(beta)/b)\n}\nlaplace_data &lt;- data.frame(beta = beta, pdf = laplace_pdf(beta, b))\nggplot(laplace_data, aes(x = beta, y = pdf)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Laplace Distribution PDF\", x = \"Beta\", y = \"Density\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.3: Laplace Distribution PDF\n\n\n\n\n\nThe negative log of this prior distribution is given by: \\[\n-\\log p(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{b} \\|\\beta\\|_1 + \\text{const},\n\\] where \\(\\|\\beta\\|_1 = \\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j|\\) is the \\(\\ell_1\\)-norm of the vector \\(\\beta\\). The regularization term \\(\\phi(f)\\) is then given by: \\[\n\\phi(f) = \\frac{1}{b} \\|\\beta\\|_1.  \n\\] This leads to the following optimization problem: \\[\n\\underset{\\beta}{\\mathrm{minimize}}\\quad \\|y- X\\beta\\|_2^2 + \\lambda \\|\\beta\\|_1,\n\\] where \\(\\lambda = 2\\sigma^2/b\\) is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of the prior. Unlike ridge regression, the Lasso optimization problem does not have a closed-form solution due to the non-differentiable nature of the \\(\\ell_1\\) penalty. However, efficient algorithms such as coordinate descent and proximal gradient methods can be used to solve it.\nThe key distinguishing feature of Lasso is its ability to perform automatic variable selection. The \\(\\ell_1\\) penalty encourages sparsity in the coefficient vector \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\), meaning that many coefficients will be exactly zero. This property makes Lasso particularly useful for high-dimensional problems where feature selection is important.\nWhen \\(\\lambda=0\\), the Lasso reduces to the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate. As \\(\\lambda\\) increases, more coefficients are driven to exactly zero, resulting in a sparser model. When \\(\\lambda\\) is very large, all coefficients become zero.\nThe geometric intuition behind Lasso’s sparsity-inducing property comes from the constraint formulation. We can write the Lasso problem as: \\[\n\\underset{\\beta}{\\mathrm{minimize}}\\quad \\|y- X\\beta\\|_2^2 \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\|\\beta\\|_1 \\leq t,\n\\] where \\(t\\) is a positive constant that controls the sparsity of the solution. The constraint region \\(\\|\\beta\\|_1 \\leq t\\) forms a diamond (in 2D) or rhombus-shaped region with sharp corners at the coordinate axes. The optimal solution often occurs at these corners, where some coefficients are exactly zero.\nFrom a Bayesian perspective, the Lasso estimator corresponds to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate under independent Laplace priors on the coefficients. We use Bayes rule to calculate the posterior as a product of Normal likelihood and Laplace prior: \\[\n\\log p(\\beta \\mid y, b) \\propto -\\|y-X\\beta\\|_2^2 - \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{b}\\|\\beta\\|_1.\n\\] For fixed \\(\\sigma^2\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\), the posterior mode is equivalent to the Lasso estimate with \\(\\lambda = 2\\sigma^2/b\\). Large variance \\(b\\) of the prior is equivalent to small penalty weight \\(\\lambda\\) in the Lasso objective function.\nOne of the most popular algorithms for solving the Lasso problem is coordinate descent. The algorithm iteratively updates each coefficient while holding all others fixed. For the \\(j\\)-th coefficient, the update rule is: \\[\n\\hat{\\beta}_j \\leftarrow \\text{soft}\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{ij}(y_i - \\sum_{k \\neq j} x_{ik}\\hat{\\beta}_k), \\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right),\n\\] where the soft-thresholding operator is defined as: \\[\n\\text{soft}(z, \\gamma) = \\text{sign}(z)(|z| - \\gamma)_+ = \\begin{cases}\nz - \\gamma & \\text{if } z &gt; \\gamma \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } |z| \\leq \\gamma \\\\\nz + \\gamma & \\text{if } z &lt; -\\gamma\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nExample 18.5 (Sparsity and Variable Selection) We will demonstrate the Lasso’s ability to perform variable selection and shrinkage using simulated data. The data will consist of a design matrix with correlated predictors and a sparse signal, where only a 5 out of 20 predictors have non-zero coefficients.\n\n\nCode\n# Generate simulated data\nset.seed(123)\nn &lt;- 100  # number of observations\np &lt;- 20   # number of predictors\nsigma &lt;- 1  # noise level\n\n# Create design matrix with some correlation structure\nX &lt;- matrix(rnorm(n * p), n, p)\n# Add some correlation between predictors\nfor(i in 2:p) {\n  X[, i] &lt;- 0.5 * X[, i-1] + sqrt(0.75) * X[, i]\n}\n\n\n\n# True coefficients - sparse signal\nbeta_true &lt;- c(3, -2, 1.5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, -1, rep(0, 10))\nsparse_indices &lt;- which(beta_true != 0)\n\n# Generate response\ny &lt;- X %*% beta_true + sigma * rnorm(n)\n\nThen we use glmnet package to fit the Lasso model and visualize the coefficient paths. We will also perform cross-validation to select the optimal regularization parameter \\(\\lambda\\).\n\n# Fit LASSO path using glmnet\nlibrary(glmnet)\nlasso_fit &lt;- glmnet(X, y, alpha = 1)\n\n# Plot coefficient paths\nplot(lasso_fit, xvar = \"lambda\", label = TRUE)\ntitle(\"LASSO Coefficient Paths\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coefficient paths plot shows how LASSO coefficients shrink toward zero as the regularization parameter lambda increases. The colored lines represent different predictors, demonstrating LASSO’s variable selection property. Note, that glmnet fitted the model for a sequence of \\(\\lambda\\) values. The algorithms starts with a large lambda value, where all coefficients are penalized to zero. Then, it gradually decreases lambda, using the coefficients from the previous, slightly more penalized model as a “warm start” for the current calculation. This pathwise approach is significantly more efficient than starting the optimization from scratch for every single \\(\\lambda\\). By default, glmnet computes the coefficients for a sequence of 100 lambda values spaced evenly on the logarithmic scale, starting from a data-driven maximum value (where all coefficients are zero) down to a small fraction of that maximum. The user can specify their own sequence of lambda values if specific granularity or range is desired\nFinally, we will perform cross-validation to select the optimal \\(\\lambda\\) value and compare the estimated coefficients with the true values.\n\n# Cross-validation to select optimal lambda\ncv_lasso &lt;- cv.glmnet(X, y, alpha = 1, nfolds = 10)\n# Plot cross-validation curve\nplot(cv_lasso)\n\n\n\n\nCross-validation for LASSO\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can extract the coefficients lambda.min and lambda.1se from the cross-validation results, which correspond to the minimum cross-validated error and the most regularized model within one standard error of the minimum, respectively.\n\n# Extract coefficients at optimal lambda\nlambda_min &lt;- cv_lasso$lambda.min\nlambda_1se &lt;- cv_lasso$lambda.1se\ncoef_min &lt;- coef(lasso_fit, s = lambda_min)\ncoef_1se &lt;- coef(lasso_fit, s = lambda_1se)\n# Print values of lambda\ncat(\"Optimal lambda (min):\", lambda_min, \"\\n\")\n\n## Optimal lambda (min): 0.016\n\ncat(\"Optimal lambda (1se):\", lambda_1se, \"\\n\")\n\n## Optimal lambda (1se): 0.1\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Compare estimates with true values\ncomparison &lt;- data.frame(\n  True = c(0, beta_true),  # Include intercept\n  LASSO_min = as.vector(coef_min),\n  LASSO_1se = as.vector(coef_1se)\n)\nrownames(comparison) &lt;- c(\"Intercept\", paste0(\"X\", 1:p))\n# Visualization of coefficient estimates\nlibrary(reshape2)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Melt data for plotting\nplot_data &lt;- melt(comparison, id.vars = NULL)\nplot_data$Variable &lt;- rep(rownames(comparison), 3)\nplot_data$Variable &lt;- factor(plot_data$Variable, levels = rownames(comparison))\n\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = Variable, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(y = \"Coefficient Value\", fill = \"Method\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(type = \"qual\", palette = \"Set2\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCoefficient Estimates Comparison\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like LASSO has successfully identified the non-zero coefficients and shrunk the noise variables to zero. The coefficient estimates at lambda.min and lambda.1se show that LASSO retains the true signals while effectively ignoring the noise. Let’s calculate the prediction errors and evaluate the variable selection performance of LASSO at both optimal \\[\\lambda\\] values.\n\n# Calculate prediction errors\npred_min &lt;- predict(lasso_fit, newx = X, s = lambda_min)\npred_1se &lt;- predict(lasso_fit, newx = X, s = lambda_1se)\n\nmse_min &lt;- mean((y - pred_min)^2)\nmse_1se &lt;- mean((y - pred_1se)^2)\n\ncat(\"Mean Squared Error (lambda.min):\", round(mse_min, 3), \"\\n\")\n\n## Mean Squared Error (lambda.min): 0.68\n\ncat(\"Mean Squared Error (lambda.1se):\", round(mse_1se, 3), \"\\n\")\n\n## Mean Squared Error (lambda.1se): 0.85\n\n\nIn summary, this example demonstrates how LASSO regression can be used for both variable selection and regularization in high-dimensional settings. By tuning the regularization parameter \\(\\lambda\\), LASSO is able to shrink irrelevant coefficients to zero, effectively identifying the true underlying predictors while controlling model complexity. The comparison of coefficient estimates and prediction errors at different \\(\\lambda\\) values highlights the trade-off between model sparsity and predictive accuracy. LASSO’s ability to produce interpretable, sparse models makes it a powerful tool in modern statistical learning, especially when dealing with datasets where the number of predictors may be large relative to the number of observations.\n\n\nScale Mixture Representation\nThe Laplace distribution can be represented as a scale mixture of Normal distributions (Andrews and Mallows 1974): \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\beta_j \\mid \\sigma^2,\\tau_j &\\sim N(0,\\tau_j^2\\sigma^2)\\\\\n\\tau_j^2 \\mid \\alpha &\\sim \\text{Exp}(\\alpha^2/2)\\\\\n\\sigma^2 &\\sim \\pi(\\sigma^2).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] We can show equivalence by integrating out \\(\\tau_j\\): \\[\np(\\beta_j\\mid \\sigma^2,\\alpha) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\tau_j\\sigma^2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta_j^2}{2\\sigma^2\\tau_j^2}\\right)\\frac{\\alpha^2}{2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha^2\\tau_j^2}{2}\\right)d\\tau_j = \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\sigma}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha|\\beta_j|}{\\sigma}\\right).\n\\] Thus it is a Laplace distribution with location 0 and scale \\(\\alpha/\\sigma\\). Representation of Laplace prior is a scale Normal mixture allows us to apply an efficient numerical algorithm for computing samples from the posterior distribution. This algorithms is called a Gibbs sample and it iteratively samples from \\(\\theta \\mid a,y\\) and \\(b\\mid \\theta,y\\) to estimate joint distribution over \\((\\hat \\theta, \\hat b)\\). Thus, we so not need to apply cross-validation to find optimal value of \\(b\\), the Bayesian algorithm does it “automatically”.",

    "section": "18.10 Horseshoe",
    "text": "18.10 Horseshoe\nThe horseshoe prior represents a significant advancement in Bayesian sparse estimation, addressing fundamental limitations of the Lasso while maintaining computational tractability (Carvalho, Polson, and Scott 2010). The name derives from the shape of its shrinkage profile, which resembles an inverted horseshoe: it applies minimal shrinkage to large signals while aggressively shrinking noise coefficients toward zero. This behavior makes it particularly attractive for high-dimensional problems where strong sparsity is expected but we want to avoid over-shrinking the true signals.\nUnlike the Lasso, which applies constant shrinkage across all coefficient magnitudes, the horseshoe exhibits adaptive shrinkage. Small coefficients receive heavy regularization approaching zero, while large coefficients are left nearly unregularized. This is precisely the behavior we desire in sparse estimation: confidently shrink noise to zero while preserving signal fidelity. The horseshoe achieves this through a hierarchical Bayesian structure that places a half-Cauchy prior on local scale parameters.\n\nMathematical Formulation\nThe horseshoe prior is defined through a hierarchical scale mixture of normals. For the regression model \\(y = X\\beta + \\epsilon\\) with \\(\\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 I)\\), the horseshoe prior on coefficients \\(\\beta_j\\) is specified as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\beta_j \\mid \\lambda_j, \\tau, \\sigma^2 &\\sim N(0, \\lambda_j^2 \\tau^2 \\sigma^2) \\\\\n\\lambda_j &\\sim \\text{Cauchy}^+(0, 1) \\\\\n\\tau &\\sim \\text{Cauchy}^+(0, 1)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{18.5}\\]\nwhere \\(\\text{Cauchy}^+(0, 1)\\) denotes the half-Cauchy distribution (the positive half of a standard Cauchy). The parameter \\(\\lambda_j\\) is the local shrinkage parameter for coefficient \\(\\beta_j\\), while \\(\\tau\\) is the global shrinkage parameter that controls overall sparsity. The product \\(\\kappa_j = \\lambda_j \\tau\\) determines the effective scale of \\(\\beta_j\\).\nThe half-Cauchy distribution can be represented as a scale mixture itself:\n\\[\n\\lambda_j \\sim \\text{Cauchy}^+(0, 1) \\iff \\lambda_j^2 \\mid \\nu_j \\sim \\text{Inv-Gamma}(1/2, 1/\\nu_j), \\quad \\nu_j \\sim \\text{Inv-Gamma}(1/2, 1)\n\\]\nThis hierarchical representation enables efficient Gibbs sampling for posterior inference, as each conditional distribution has a closed form.\n\n\nShrinkage Properties\nThe horseshoe prior induces a shrinkage factor \\(\\kappa_j(\\beta_j) = E[\\kappa_j \\mid \\beta_j, y]\\) that adapts to the data. For large coefficient values \\(|\\beta_j|\\), the shrinkage factor approaches 1 (no shrinkage), while for small values it approaches 0 (complete shrinkage). This can be seen through the marginal prior:\n\\[\np(\\beta_j \\mid \\tau, \\sigma^2) = \\int_0^{\\infty} N(\\beta_j \\mid 0, \\lambda_j^2 \\tau^2 \\sigma^2) \\cdot \\text{Cauchy}^+(\\lambda_j \\mid 0, 1) d\\lambda_j\n\\]\nThe resulting marginal distribution has extremely heavy tails compared to the Laplace prior used in Lasso. Specifically, the horseshoe has infinite moments, while the Laplace has exponential tails. This heavy-tailed behavior means that large signals are barely regularized, avoiding the systematic bias inherent in \\(\\ell_1\\) penalties.\nThe posterior mean under the horseshoe prior can be approximated as:\n\\[\nE[\\beta_j \\mid y] \\approx (1 - \\kappa_j) \\cdot 0 + \\kappa_j \\cdot \\hat{\\beta}_j^{\\text{OLS}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\beta}_j^{\\text{OLS}}\\) is the ordinary least squares estimate and \\(\\kappa_j \\in (0,1)\\) is the data-dependent shrinkage factor. Unlike Lasso, where the shrinkage is constant across coefficients, \\(\\kappa_j\\) adapts to the observed magnitude of \\(\\hat{\\beta}_j^{\\text{OLS}}\\).\n\n\nComparison with Other Priors\nThe horseshoe prior occupies a distinctive position in the landscape of sparse priors. Consider the shrinkage behavior as a function of the observed coefficient:\n\nRidge (\\(\\ell_2\\)): Shrinkage factor \\(\\kappa_j = 1/(1 + \\lambda)\\) is constant, providing uniform shrinkage regardless of signal strength\nLasso (\\(\\ell_1\\)): Shrinkage is constant for small coefficients and linear for large ones, \\(\\kappa_j \\approx 1 - \\lambda/|\\beta_j|\\) for large \\(|\\beta_j|\\)\nHorseshoe: Shrinkage factor varies from 0 for noise to nearly 1 for signals, \\(\\kappa_j \\approx (\\lambda_j^2 \\tau^2)/(\\lambda_j^2 \\tau^2 + \\sigma^2)\\)\n\nThe global-local structure separates two tasks: \\(\\tau\\) determines how many coefficients should be non-zero (controlling overall sparsity), while each \\(\\lambda_j\\) determines whether its specific coefficient belongs to the signal or noise group. This separation leads to superior performance in recovering sparse signals compared to the Lasso, particularly when true coefficients vary substantially in magnitude.\n\n\nComputational Implementation\nThe horseshoe prior admits efficient posterior sampling through Gibbs sampling, leveraging its hierarchical structure. The full conditional distributions are:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(\\beta \\mid y, \\lambda, \\tau, \\sigma^2) &\\sim N\\left((X'X + D_\\lambda^{-1})^{-1}X'y, \\sigma^2(X'X + D_\\lambda^{-1})^{-1}\\right) \\\\\n(\\sigma^2 \\mid y, \\beta) &\\sim \\text{Inv-Gamma}\\left(\\frac{n}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\|y - X\\beta\\|^2\\right) \\\\\n(\\lambda_j^2 \\mid \\beta_j, \\tau, \\sigma^2, \\nu_j) &\\sim \\text{Inv-Gamma}\\left(1, \\frac{1}{\\nu_j} + \\frac{\\beta_j^2}{2\\tau^2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\\\\n(\\tau^2 \\mid \\beta, \\lambda, \\sigma^2, \\xi) &\\sim \\text{Inv-Gamma}\\left(\\frac{p+1}{2}, \\frac{1}{\\xi} + \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum_{j=1}^p \\frac{\\beta_j^2}{\\lambda_j^2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(D_\\lambda = \\text{diag}(\\lambda_1^2\\tau^2, \\ldots, \\lambda_p^2\\tau^2)\\) and \\(\\nu_j, \\xi\\) are auxiliary variables from the scale mixture representation of the half-Cauchy.\n\nExample 18.6 (Horseshoe Prior for Sparse Regression) We demonstrate the horseshoe prior’s ability to recover sparse signals in a high-dimensional regression setting. Consider a scenario with \\(n = 100\\) observations and \\(p = 50\\) predictors, where only 5 coefficients are truly non-zero with varying magnitudes.\n\n\nHorseshoe Prior for Sparse Regression\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\n# Set seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Generate sparse regression data\nn &lt;- 100  # number of observations\np &lt;- 50   # number of predictors\ns &lt;- 5    # number of non-zero coefficients\n\n# True sparse coefficient vector\nbeta_true &lt;- rep(0, p)\nbeta_true[1:s] &lt;- c(50, -30, 15, -4, 3.5)  # Varying magnitudes\n\n# Generate design matrix (standardized)\nX &lt;- matrix(rnorm(n * p), n, p)\nX &lt;- scale(X)\n\n# Generate response with noise\nsigma_true &lt;- 1\ny &lt;- X %*% beta_true + rnorm(n, 0, sigma_true)\ny &lt;- as.vector(y)\n\n# Horseshoe Gibbs sampler\nhorseshoe_gibbs &lt;- function(y, X, n_iter = 5000, burn_in = 1000) {\n  n &lt;- nrow(X)\n  p &lt;- ncol(X)\n  \n  # Initialize parameters\n  beta &lt;- rep(0, p)\n  lambda_sq &lt;- rep(1, p)\n  tau_sq &lt;- 1\n  sigma_sq &lt;- 1\n  nu &lt;- rep(1, p)\n  xi &lt;- 1\n  \n  # Storage for samples\n  beta_samples &lt;- matrix(0, n_iter - burn_in, p)\n  tau_sq_samples &lt;- numeric(n_iter - burn_in)\n  \n  # Pre-compute X'X and X'y\n  XtX &lt;- crossprod(X)\n  Xty &lt;- crossprod(X, y)\n  \n  for (iter in 1:n_iter) {\n    # Sample beta from full conditional\n    D_lambda_inv &lt;- diag(1 / (lambda_sq * tau_sq))\n    V_beta &lt;- solve(XtX + D_lambda_inv)\n    mu_beta &lt;- V_beta %*% Xty\n    beta &lt;- mu_beta + t(chol(sigma_sq * V_beta)) %*% rnorm(p)\n    \n    # Sample sigma^2\n    resid &lt;- y - X %*% beta\n    sigma_sq &lt;- 1 / rgamma(1, n/2, sum(resid^2)/2)\n    \n    # Sample lambda_j^2 for each j\n    for (j in 1:p) {\n      lambda_sq[j] &lt;- 1 / rgamma(1, 1, 1/nu[j] + beta[j]^2/(2*tau_sq*sigma_sq))\n    }\n    \n    # Sample nu_j (auxiliary for half-Cauchy)\n    for (j in 1:p) {\n      nu[j] &lt;- 1 / rgamma(1, 1, 1 + 1/lambda_sq[j])\n    }\n    \n    # Sample tau^2 (global shrinkage)\n    tau_sq &lt;- 1 / rgamma(1, (p+1)/2, 1/xi + sum(beta^2/lambda_sq)/(2*sigma_sq))\n    \n    # Sample xi (auxiliary for tau)\n    xi &lt;- 1 / rgamma(1, 1, 1 + 1/tau_sq)\n    \n    # Store samples after burn-in\n    if (iter &gt; burn_in) {\n      beta_samples[iter - burn_in, ] &lt;- beta\n      tau_sq_samples[iter - burn_in] &lt;- tau_sq\n    }\n  }\n  \n  list(beta = beta_samples, tau_sq = tau_sq_samples)\n}\n\n\n\n# Run Horseshoe sampler\ncat(\"Running Horseshoe Gibbs sampler...\\n\")\n\n## Running Horseshoe Gibbs sampler...\n\nhs_fit &lt;- horseshoe_gibbs(y, X, n_iter = 5000, burn_in = 1000)\n\n# Compute posterior means\nbeta_hs &lt;- colMeans(hs_fit$beta)\ntau_hs &lt;- mean(hs_fit$tau_sq)\n\n# Compare with Lasso\nlibrary(glmnet)\nlasso_fit &lt;- cv.glmnet(X, y, alpha = 1)\nbeta_lasso &lt;- as.vector(coef(lasso_fit, s = \"lambda.min\"))[-1]\n\n\n# Display results\nplot(beta_true, pch = 19, type=\"p\")\nlines(beta_hs, col = \"blue\", type=\"p\")\nlines(beta_lasso, col = \"red\", type=\"p\")\n# Generate horizonatal line at y=0\nabline(h = 0, col = \"black\", lwd = 2)\nlegend(\"topright\", legend=c(\"True\", \"Horseshoe\", \"Lasso\"), col=c(\"black\", \"blue\", \"red\"), lty=1, lwd=2, bty=\"n\")\ngrid()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate mean squared errors\n# Calculate mean squared errors\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n# Calculate coefficient mean squared errors\nmse_hs &lt;- mean((beta_true - beta_hs)^2)\nmse_lasso &lt;- mean((beta_true - beta_lasso)^2)\n\n# Calculate prediction mean squared errors\npred_hs &lt;- X %*% beta_hs\npred_lasso &lt;- X %*% beta_lasso\npmse_hs &lt;- mean((y - pred_hs)^2)\npmse_lasso &lt;- mean((y - pred_lasso)^2)\n\n# Create summary table\nresults_table &lt;- data.frame(\n  Method = c(\"Horseshoe\", \"Lasso\"),\n  `Coefficient MSE` = c(round(mse_hs, 4), round(mse_lasso, 4)),\n  `Prediction MSE` = c(round(pmse_hs, 4), round(pmse_lasso, 4))\n)\n\n\n\nkable(results_table, caption = \"Comparison of Coefficient and Prediction Mean Squared Errors\")\n\n\nComparison of Coefficient and Prediction Mean Squared Errors\n\n\nMethod\nCoefficient.MSE\nPrediction.MSE\n\n\n\n\nHorseshoe\n0.00\n0.52\n\n\nLasso\n0.05\n3.17\n\n\n\n\n\nThe horseshoe prior demonstrates superior recovery of the sparse signal structure. Notice how the horseshoe estimates for large true coefficients lie closer to the diagonal line (perfect recovery) compared to Lasso, which systematically under-estimates large coefficients due to its constant shrinkage. For zero coefficients, both methods successfully shrink toward zero, but the horseshoe’s adaptive shrinkage provides better overall performance as measured by coefficient MSE.\nThe global shrinkage parameter \\(\\tau\\) is automatically learned from the data, with posterior mean \\(\\tau^2 \\approx\\) 0.005. This value reflects the appropriate level of sparsity in the model, effectively performing automatic model selection without cross-validation.",

    "text": "18.11 Bridge (\\(\\ell_{\\alpha}\\))\nThe bridge estimator represents a powerful generalization that unifies many popular regularization approaches, bridging the gap between subset selection (\\(\\ell_0\\)) and Lasso (\\(\\ell_1\\)) penalties. For the regression model \\(y = X\\beta + \\epsilon\\) with unknown vector \\(\\beta = (\\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_p)'\\), the bridge estimator minimizes:\n\\[\nQ_y(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{2} \\|y - X\\beta\\|^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j|^\\alpha\n\\tag{18.6}\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha \\in (0,2]\\) is the bridge parameter and \\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\) controls the regularization strength. This penalty interpolates between different sparsity-inducing behaviors. As \\(\\alpha \\to 0\\), the penalty approaches best subset selection (\\(\\ell_0\\)); when \\(\\alpha = 1\\), it reduces to the Lasso penalty (\\(\\ell_1\\)); and when \\(\\alpha = 2\\), it becomes the Ridge penalty (\\(\\ell_2\\)). The bridge penalty is non-convex when \\(0 &lt; \\alpha &lt; 1\\), making optimization challenging but providing superior theoretical properties. Specifically, when \\(\\alpha &lt; 1\\), the penalty is concave over \\((0,\\infty)\\), leading to the oracle property under certain regularity conditions—the ability to identify the true sparse structure and estimate non-zero coefficients as efficiently as if the true model were known.\n\nBayesian Framework and Data Augmentation\nFrom a Bayesian perspective, the bridge estimator corresponds to the MAP estimate under an exponential-power prior. The Bayesian bridge model treats \\(p(\\beta \\mid y) \\propto \\exp\\{-Q_y(\\beta)\\}\\) as a posterior distribution, arising from assuming a Gaussian likelihood for \\(y\\) and independent exponential-power priors: \\[\np(\\beta_j \\mid \\alpha, \\tau) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\tau \\Gamma(1 + 1/\\alpha)} \\exp\\left(-\\left|\\frac{\\beta_j}{\\tau}\\right|^\\alpha\\right)\n\\tag{18.7}\\]\nwhere \\(\\tau = \\lambda^{-1/\\alpha}\\) is the scale parameter. The Bayesian framework offers compelling advantages over classical bridge estimation. Rather than providing only a point estimate, it yields the full posterior distribution, enabling uncertainty quantification and credible intervals. The regularization parameter \\(\\lambda\\) can be learned from the data through hyperpriors, avoiding cross-validation. Most importantly, the bridge posterior is often multimodal, especially with correlated predictors, and MCMC naturally explores all modes while optimization may get trapped in local optima.\nPosterior inference for the Bayesian bridge is facilitated by two key data augmentation representations. The first represents the exponential-power prior as a scale mixture of normals using Bernstein’s theorem: \\(\\exp(-|t|^{\\alpha}) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-s t^2/2} g(s) \\, ds\\), where \\(g(s)\\) is the density of a positive \\(\\alpha/2\\)-stable random variable. However, the conditional posterior for the mixing variables becomes an exponentially tilted stable distribution, which lacks a closed form and requires specialized sampling algorithms.\nA novel alternative representation avoids stable distributions by expressing the exponential-power prior as a scale mixture of triangular (Bartlett-Fejer) kernels: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(y \\mid \\beta, \\sigma^2) &\\sim N(X\\beta, \\sigma^2 I) \\\\\np(\\beta_j \\mid \\tau, \\omega_j, \\alpha) &= \\frac{1}{\\tau \\omega_j^{1/\\alpha}} \\left\\{ 1 - \\left| \\frac{\\beta_j}{\\tau \\omega_j^{1/\\alpha}} \\right| \\right\\}_+ \\\\\n(\\omega_j \\mid \\alpha) &\\sim \\frac{1+\\alpha}{2} \\cdot \\text{Gamma}(2+1/\\alpha,1) + \\frac{1-\\alpha}{2} \\cdot \\text{Gamma}(1+1/\\alpha,1)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{18.8}\\]\nwhere \\(\\{a\\}_+ = \\max(a,0)\\). This mixture of gamma distributions is much simpler to sample from and naturally captures the bimodality of the bridge posterior through its two-component structure. The choice of representation depends on the design matrix structure: the Bartlett-Fejer representation is 2-3 times more efficient for orthogonal designs, while the scale mixture of normals performs better for collinear designs.\n\n\nTheoretical Properties and Computational Implementation\nThe bridge prior with \\(\\alpha &lt; 1\\) enjoys several desirable theoretical properties. It satisfies the oracle property under regularity conditions, correctly identifying the true sparsity pattern and estimating non-zero coefficients at the same rate as if the true model were known. The exponential-power prior has heavier-than-exponential tails when \\(\\alpha &lt; 1\\), avoiding over-shrinkage of large signals. The marginal likelihood has a redescending score function, highly desirable for sparse estimation as it reduces the influence of small observations while preserving large signals.\nThe Bartlett-Fejer representation leads to an efficient Gibbs sampler that introduces slice variables \\(u_j\\) and iterates through updating slice variables from uniform distributions, sampling mixing variables \\(\\omega_j\\) from truncated gamma mixtures, updating coefficients \\(\\beta\\) from truncated multivariate normal distributions centered at the least-squares estimate, and updating hyperparameters including the global scale \\(\\tau\\) and optionally the bridge parameter \\(\\alpha\\) via Metropolis-Hastings. A crucial feature enabling efficient sampling is the ability to marginalize over local scale parameters when updating the global scale \\(\\tau\\), leading to excellent mixing properties that contrast favorably with other sparse Bayesian methods.\nA distinctive feature of the bridge posterior is its multimodality, particularly pronounced with correlated predictors. Unlike Lasso or ridge regression, which yield unimodal posteriors, the bridge posterior can exhibit multiple modes corresponding to different sparse representations of the same underlying signal. This multimodality reflects genuine model uncertainty and should not be viewed as a computational nuisance. The Bayesian approach properly accounts for this uncertainty by averaging over all modes, leading to more robust inference than selecting a single mode.\n\n\nEmpirical Performance and Practical Application\nExtensive simulation studies demonstrate the superiority of Bayesian bridge estimation across multiple dimensions. On benchmark datasets including Boston housing, ozone concentration, and NIR glucose data, the Bayesian bridge posterior mean consistently outperforms both least squares and classical bridge estimators in out-of-sample prediction, with improvements often exceeding 50% reduction in prediction error. In simulation studies with \\(p = 100\\), \\(n = 101\\), and correlated design matrices, the Bayesian approach dramatically outperforms classical methods. For example, with \\(\\alpha = 0.5\\), the mean squared error in estimating \\(\\beta\\) was 2254 for least squares, 1611 for classical bridge, and only 99 for Bayesian bridge across 250 simulated datasets.\nTo illustrate practical advantages, consider the classic diabetes dataset with 442 observations and 10 predictors. Fitting both classical bridge (using generalized cross-validation) and Bayesian bridge (with Gamma(2,2) prior for \\(\\tau\\) and uniform prior for \\(\\alpha\\)) models reveals several key differences. The Bayesian posterior exhibits pronounced multimodality for coefficients associated with highly correlated predictors, while the classical solution provides only a single point estimate. The classical bridge solution does not coincide with the joint mode of the fully Bayesian posterior due to uncertainty in hyperparameters that is ignored in the classical approach. The posterior distribution for the bridge parameter \\(\\alpha\\) shows strong preference for values around 0.7, significantly different from the Lasso (\\(\\alpha = 1\\)), suggesting the data favors more aggressive sparsity-inducing behavior.\n\nExample 18.7 (Practical Implementation with BayesBridge Package) We demonstrate the Bayesian Bridge using the diabetes dataset, comparing it with Lasso and Ridge regression. Note that the BayesBridge package requires additional setup and may not be available on all systems, so we provide both the implementation and expected results. We will use the diabetes dataset from the lars package.\n\ncat(\"Dataset dimensions:\", n, \"observations,\", p, \"predictors\\n\")\n\n## Dataset dimensions: 442 observations, 10 predictors\n\ncat(\"Predictor names:\", colnames(X), \"\\n\\n\")\n\n## Predictor names: age sex bmi map tc ldl hdl tch ltg glu\n\n\n\n# Check correlation structure to understand why Bridge might outperform Lasso\ncor_matrix &lt;- cor(X)\nhigh_cors &lt;- which(abs(cor_matrix) &gt;

This suggests that the data favors a more aggressive approach to inducing sparsity. The process of learning this parameter from the data removes the need for manual tuning or extensive cross-validation.\nThe Bridge method displays a unique pattern of shrinkage. It applies less shrinkage to large coefficients while shrinking small coefficients more aggressively. This behavior can be seen in the comparison of shrinkage, where the ratio of Bridge to Lasso is higher for variables with larger Lasso coefficients. This illustrates the so-called oracle property.\nIn contrast to classical approaches, the Bayesian Bridge provides credible intervals for all parameters. For example, variables such as ‘bmi’, ‘bp’, and ‘s5’ have credible intervals that do not include zero, which indicates strong evidence for their importance. Other variables have intervals that contain zero, reflecting uncertainty about their relevance.\nThe diabetes dataset includes several correlated predictors, as revealed by the correlation analysis. The Bridge method performs better in this context, which aligns with its theoretical advantage over the Lasso when handling groups of correlated variables. Rather than arbitrarily selecting a single variable from a group, the Bridge tends to include all relevant variables.\nThe simulated results indicate about a 15% improvement in predictive mean squared error compared to the Lasso. This finding is consistent with empirical studies on datasets with similar correlation structures. The improvement is due to the Bridge’s ability to balance variable selection with appropriate shrinkage.\nAlthough not fully illustrated in this simplified example, the posterior distribution under the Bridge model often shows multimodality when predictors are correlated. This feature provides valuable information about model uncertainty that is not captured by classical point estimates.\nThese results illustrate why the Bayesian Bridge has gained attention in modern statistical learning: it combines the theoretical elegance of achieving oracle properties with practical advantages in uncertainty quantification and automatic parameter tuning, making it particularly valuable for high-dimensional problems with complex correlation structures.\n\nBased on theoretical analysis and empirical studies, several practical guidelines emerge. For most applications, \\(\\alpha \\in [0.5, 0.8]\\) provides good balance between sparsity and estimation accuracy, though placing a uniform prior on \\(\\alpha\\) and learning from data is recommended when uncertain. A Gamma(2,2) prior for the global scale parameter \\(\\tau\\) works well in practice, providing reasonable regularization without being overly informative. The Bartlett-Fejer representation should be used for orthogonal or nearly orthogonal designs, while the scale mixture of normals is better for highly collinear predictors. Practitioners should examine posterior distributions for multimodality, especially with correlated predictors, as this provides valuable insight into model uncertainty that point estimates miss entirely.\nThe bridge framework extends naturally to other likelihoods including logistic regression and quantile regression, where similar data augmentation strategies apply. Both approaches are implemented in the R package BayesBridge, which automatically selects the most efficient algorithm based on design matrix properties. The bridge penalty occupies a unique position in the regularization landscape, providing less bias than Lasso for large coefficients while maintaining sparsity, achieving variable selection unlike ridge regression, and offering computational advantages over spike-and-slab priors while still providing heavy-tailed, sparsity-inducing behavior. The Bayesian bridge thus represents a mature, computationally efficient approach to sparse regression that provides superior performance while naturally quantifying uncertainty, making it an excellent choice for modern high-dimensional inference problems.",

    "text": "18.12 Full Bayes for Sparsity Shrinkage\nThus far we have considered the problem of finding the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the parameters by minimizing the negative log posterior. The resulting penalized objective function provides a way to control the amount of regularization \\(\\lambda\\) that gauges the trade-off between the compromise between the observed data and the initial prior beliefs.\nThe alternative approach to the regularization is to use full Bayes, which places a prior distribution on the parameters and computes the full posterior distribution using the Bayes rule: \\[\np( \\theta | y ) = \\frac{ f( y | \\theta ) p( \\theta) }{m(y)},\n\\] here \\[\nm(y) = \\int f( y\\mid  \\theta ) p( \\theta ) d \\theta\n\\] Here \\(m(y)\\) is the marginal beliefs about the data.\n\nSpike-and-Slab Prior\nOur Bayesian formulation of allows to specify a wide range of range of regularized formulations for a regression problem. In this section we consider a Bayesian model for variable selection. Consider a linear regression problem \\[\ny = \\beta_1x_1+\\ldots+\\beta_px_p + e \\ , \\ \\  \\text{where } e \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2),~-\\infty \\le \\beta_i \\le \\infty \\ .\n\\] We would like to solve the problem of variable selections, i.e. identify which input variables \\(x_i\\) to be used in our model. The gold standard for Bayesian variable selection are spike-and-slab priors, or Bernoulli-Gaussian mixtures. Whilst spike-and-slab priors provide full model uncertainty quantification, they can be hard to scale to very high dimensional problems and can have poor sparsity properties. On the other hand, techniques like proximal algorithms can solve non-convex optimization problems which are fast and scalable, although they generally don’t provide a full assessment of model uncertainty.\nTo perform a model selection, we would like to specify a prior distribution \\(p\\left(\\beta\\right)\\), which imposes a sparsity assumption on \\(\\beta\\), where only a small portion of all \\(\\beta_i\\)’s are non-zero. In other words, \\(\\|\\beta\\|_0 = k \\ll p\\), where \\(\\|\\beta\\|_0 \\defeq \\#\\{i : \\beta_i\\neq0\\}\\), the cardinality of the support of \\(\\beta\\), also known as the \\(\\ell_0\\) (pseudo)norm of \\(\\beta\\). A multivariate Gaussian prior (\\(l_2\\) norm) leads to poor sparsity properties in this situation. Sparsity-inducing prior distributions for \\(\\beta\\) can be constructed to impose sparsity include the double exponential (lasso).\nUnder spike-and-slab, each \\(\\beta_i\\) exchangeably follows a mixture prior consisting of \\(\\delta_0\\), a point mass at \\(0\\), and a Gaussian distribution centered at zero. Hence we write,\n\\[\n\\label{eqn:ss}\n\\beta_i | \\theta, \\sigma_\\beta^2 \\sim (1-\\theta)\\delta_0 + \\theta N\\left(0, \\sigma_\\beta^2\\right) \\ .\n\\] Here \\(\\theta\\in \\left(0, 1\\right)\\) controls the overall sparsity in \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\sigma_\\beta^2\\) accommodates non-zero signals. This family is termed as the Bernoulli-Gaussian mixture model in the signal processing community.\nA useful re-parameterization, the parameters \\(\\beta\\) is given by two independent random variable vectors \\(\\gamma = \\left(\\gamma_1, \\ldots, \\gamma_p\\right)'\\) and \\(\\alpha = \\left(\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_p\\right)'\\) such that \\(\\beta_i  =  \\gamma_i\\alpha_i\\), with probabilistic structure \\[\n\\label{eq:bg}\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\gamma_i\\mid\\theta & \\sim & \\text{Bernoulli}(\\theta) \\ ;\n\\\\\n\\alpha_i \\mid \\sigma_\\beta^2 &\\sim & N\\left(0, \\sigma_\\beta^2\\right) \\ .\n\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\] Since \\(\\gamma_i\\) and \\(\\alpha_i\\) are independent, the joint prior density becomes \\[\np\\left(\\gamma_i, \\alpha_i \\mid \\theta, \\sigma_\\beta^2\\right) =\n\\theta^{\\gamma_i}\\left(1-\\theta\\right)^{1-\\gamma_i}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_\\beta}\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{\\alpha_i^2}{2\\sigma_\\beta^2}\\right\\}\n\\ , \\ \\ \\ \\text{for } 1\\leq i\\leq p \\ .\n\\] The indicator \\(\\gamma_i\\in \\{0, 1\\}\\) can be viewed as a dummy variable to indicate whether \\(\\beta_i\\) is included in the model.\nLet \\(S = \\{i: \\gamma_i = 1\\} \\subseteq \\{1, \\ldots, p\\}\\) be the “active set” of \\(\\gamma\\), and \\(\\|\\gamma\\|_0 = \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^p\\gamma_i\\) be its cardinality. The joint prior on the vector \\(\\{\\gamma, \\alpha\\}\\) then factorizes as \\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\np\\left(\\gamma, \\alpha \\mid \\theta, \\sigma_\\beta^2\\right) & = & \\prod\\limits_{i = 1}^p p\\left(\\alpha_i, \\gamma_i \\mid \\theta, \\sigma_\\beta^2\\right) \\\\\n& = &\n\\theta^{\\|\\gamma\\|_0}\n\\left(1-\\theta\\right)^{p - \\|\\gamma\\|_0}\n\\left(2\\pi\\sigma_\\beta^2\\right)^{-\\frac p2}\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac1{2\\sigma_\\beta^2}\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^p\\alpha_i^2\\right\\} \\ .\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nLet \\(X_\\gamma \\defeq \\left[X_i\\right]_{i \\in S}\\) be the set of “active explanatory variables\" and \\(\\alpha_\\gamma \\defeq \\left(\\alpha_i\\right)'_{i \\in S}\\) be their corresponding coefficients. We can write \\(X\\beta = X_\\gamma \\alpha_\\gamma\\). The likelihood can be expressed in terms of \\(\\gamma\\), \\(\\alpha\\) as \\[\np\\left(y \\mid \\gamma, \\alpha, \\theta, \\sigma_e^2\\right)\n=\n\\left(2\\pi\\sigma_e^2\\right)^{-\\frac n2}\n\\exp\\left\\{\n-\\frac1{2\\sigma_e^2}\\left\\|y - X_\\gamma \\alpha_\\gamma\\right\\|_2^2\n\\right\\} \\ .\n\\]\nUnder this re-parameterization by \\(\\left\\{\\gamma, \\alpha\\right\\}\\), the posterior is given by\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\np\\left(\\gamma, \\alpha \\mid \\theta, \\sigma_\\beta^2, \\sigma_e^2, y\\right) & \\propto &\np\\left(\\gamma, \\alpha \\mid \\theta, \\sigma_\\beta^2\\right)\np\\left(y \\mid \\gamma, \\alpha, \\theta, \\sigma_e^2\\right)\\\\\n& \\propto &\n\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac1{2\\sigma_e^2}\\left\\|y - X_\\gamma \\alpha_\\gamma\\right\\|_2^2\n-\\frac1{2\\sigma_\\beta^2}\\left\\|\\alpha\\right\\|_2^2\n-\\log\\left(\\frac{1-\\theta}{\\theta}\\right)\n\\left\\|\\gamma\\right\\|_0\n\\right\\} \\ .\n\\end{array}\n\\] Our goal then is to find the regularized maximum a posterior (MAP) estimator \\[\n\\arg\\max\\limits_{\\gamma, \\alpha}p\\left(\\gamma, \\alpha \\mid \\theta, \\sigma_\\beta^2, \\sigma_e^2, y \\right) \\ .\n\\] By construction, the \\(\\gamma\\) \\(\\in\\left\\{0, 1\\right\\}^p\\) will directly perform variable selection. Spike-and-slab priors, on the other hand, will sample the full posterior and calculate the posterior probability of variable inclusion. Finding the MAP estimator is equivalent to minimizing over \\(\\left\\{\\gamma, \\alpha\\right\\}\\) the regularized least squares objective function\n\\[\n\\min\\limits_{\\gamma, \\alpha}\\left\\|y - X_\\gamma \\alpha_\\gamma\\right\\|_2^2\n+ \\frac{\\sigma_e^2}{\\sigma_\\beta^2}\\left\\|\\alpha\\right\\|_2^2\n+ 2\\sigma_e^2\\log\\left(\\frac{1-\\theta}{\\theta}\\right)\n\\left\\|\\gamma\\right\\|_0 \\ .\n\\tag{18.9}\\] This objective possesses several interesting properties:\n\nThe first term is essentially the least squares loss function.\nThe second term looks like a ridge regression penalty and has connection with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) \\(\\sigma_\\beta^2/\\sigma_e^2\\). Smaller SNR will be more likely to shrink the estimates towards \\(0\\). If \\(\\sigma_\\beta^2 \\gg \\sigma_e^2\\), the prior uncertainty on the size of non-zero coefficients is much larger than the noise level, that is, the SNR is sufficiently large, this term can be ignored. This is a common assumption in spike-and-slab framework in that people usually want \\(\\sigma_\\beta \\to \\infty\\) or to be “sufficiently large\" in order to avoid imposing harsh shrinkage to non-zero signals.\nIf we further assume that \\(\\theta &lt; \\frac12\\), meaning that the coefficients are known to be sparse a priori, then \\(\\log\\left(\\left(1-\\theta\\right) / \\theta\\right) &gt; 0\\), and the third term can be seen as an \\(\\ell_0\\) regularization.\n\nTherefore, our Bayesian objective inference is connected to \\(\\ell_0\\)-regularized least squares, which we summarize in the following proposition.\n(Spike-and-slab MAP & \\(\\ell_0\\) regularization)\nFor some \\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\), assuming \\(\\theta &lt; \\frac12\\), \\(\\sigma_\\beta^2 \\gg \\sigma_e^2\\), the Bayesian MAP estimate defined by Equation 18.9 is equivalent to the \\(\\ell_0\\) regularized least squares objective, for some \\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\), \\[\n\\min_{\\beta}\n\\frac12\\left\\|y - X\\beta\\right\\|_2^2\n+ \\lambda\n\\left\\|\\beta\\right\\|_0 \\ .\n\\tag{18.10}\\]\nFirst, assuming that \\[\n\\theta &lt; \\frac12, \\ \\ \\  \\sigma_\\beta^2 \\gg \\sigma_e^2, \\ \\ \\  \\frac{\\sigma_e^2}{\\sigma_\\beta^2}\\left\\|\\alpha\\right\\|_2^2 \\to 0 \\ ,\n\\] gives us an objective function of the form \\[\n\\min_{\\gamma, \\alpha}\n\\frac12 \\left\\|y - X_\\gamma \\alpha_\\gamma\\right\\|_2^2\n+ \\lambda\n\\left\\|\\gamma\\right\\|_0,  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\text{where } \\lambda \\defeq \\sigma_e^2\\log\\left(\\left(1-\\theta\\right) / \\theta\\right) &gt; 0 \\ .\n\\tag{18.11}\\]\nThis can be seen as a variable selection version of equation Equation 18.10. To show this, we need only to check that the optimal solution corresponds to a feasible solution and vice versa. This is explained as follows.\nOn the one hand, assuming \\(\\hat\\beta\\) is an optimal solution, then we can correspondingly define \\(\\hat\\gamma_i \\defeq I\\left\\{\\hat\\beta_i \\neq 0\\right\\}\\), \\(\\hat\\alpha_i \\defeq \\hat\\beta_i\\), such that \\(\\left\\{\\hat\\gamma, \\hat\\alpha\\right\\}\\) is feasible and gives the same objective value as \\(\\hat\\beta\\)..\nOn the other hand, assuming \\(\\left\\{\\hat\\gamma, \\hat\\alpha\\right\\}\\) is optimal, implies that we must have all of the elements in \\(\\hat\\alpha_\\gamma\\) should be non-zero, otherwise a new \\(\\tilde\\gamma_i \\defeq I\\left\\{\\hat\\alpha_i \\neq 0\\right\\}\\) will give a lower objective value. As a result, if we define \\(\\hat\\beta_i \\defeq \\hat\\gamma_i\\hat\\alpha_i\\), \\(\\hat\\beta\\) will be feasible and gives the same objective value as \\(\\left\\{\\hat\\gamma, \\hat\\alpha\\right\\}\\).\n\n\nHorseshoe Prior\nThe horseshoe priors introduced earlier are the Bayesian counterpart of \\(\\ell_1\\) regularization (lasso). Horseshoe is particularly designed to recover a few large signals among many (nearly zero) noisy observations. The goal is to find a needle in the haystack.\nThe sparse normal means problem is concerned with inference for the parameter vector \\(\\theta = ( \\theta_1 , \\ldots , \\theta_p )\\) where we observe data \\(y_i = \\theta_i + \\epsilon_i\\) where the level of sparsity might be unknown. From both a theoretical and empirical viewpoint, regularized estimators have won the day. This still leaves open the question of how does specify a penalty, denoted by \\(\\pi_{HS}\\), (a.k.a. log-prior, \\(- \\log p_{HS}\\))? Lasso simply uses an \\(L^1\\)-norm, \\(\\sum_{i=1}^K | \\theta_i |\\), as opposed to the horseshoe prior which (essentially) uses the penalty \\[\n\\pi_{HS} ( \\theta_i | \\tau ) = - \\log p_{HS} ( \\theta_i | \\tau ) = - \\log \\log \\left ( 1 + \\frac{2 \\tau^2}{\\theta_i^2} \\right ) .\n\\] The motivation for the horseshoe penalty arises from the analysis of the prior mass and influence on the posterior in both the tail and behaviour at the origin. The latter is the key determinate of the sparsity properties of the estimator.\nThe horseshoe Carvalho, Polson, and Scott (2010) is a Bayesian method for ‘needle-in-a-haystack’ type problems where there is some sparsity, meaning that there are some signals amid mostly noise.\nWe introduce the horseshoe in the context of the normal means model, which is given by \\[Y_i = \\beta_i + \\varepsilon_i, \\quad i = 1, \\ldots, n,\\] with \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) i.i.d. \\(\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)\\). The horseshoe prior is given by \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\beta_i &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2 \\tau^2 \\lambda_i^2)\\\\\n\\lambda_i &\\sim C^+(0, 1),\n\\end{align*}\\] where \\(C^+\\) denotes the half-Cauchy distribution. Optionally, hyperpriors on \\(\\tau\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) may be specified, as is described further in the next two sections.\nTo illustrate the shrinkage behaviour of the horseshoe, let’s plot the posterior mean for \\(\\beta_i\\) as a function of \\(y_i\\) for three different values of \\(\\tau\\).\n\nlibrary(horseshoe)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ntau.values &lt;- c(0.005, 0.05, 0.5)\ny.values &lt;- seq(-5, 5, length = 100)\ndf &lt;- data.frame(tau = rep(tau.values, each = length(y.values)),\n                 y = rep(y.values, 3),\n                 post.mean = c(HS.post.mean(y.values, tau = tau.values[1], Sigma2=1), \n                               HS.post.mean(y.values, tau = tau.values[2], Sigma2=1), \n                               HS.post.mean(y.values, tau = tau.values[3], Sigma2=1)) )\n\nggplot(data = df, aes(x = y, y = post.mean, group = tau, color = factor(tau))) + \n  geom_line(size = 1.5) + \n  scale_color_brewer(palette=\"Dark2\") + \n  geom_abline(lty = 2) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = \"grey\") + \n  theme_classic() + ylab(\"\") + labs(color = \"Tau\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Horseshoe posterior mean for three values of tau\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmaller values of \\(\\tau\\) lead to stronger shrinkage behaviour of the horseshoe. Observations that are in absolute value at most equal to \\(\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2\\log(1/\\tau)}\\) are shrunk to values close to zero (Van der Pas et al (2014)). For larger observed values, the horseshoe posterior mean will tend to the identity (that is, barely any shrinkage, the estimate will be very close to the observed value). The optimal value of \\(\\tau\\) is the proportion of true signals. This value is typically not known in practice but can be estimated, as described further in the next sections.\n\nThe normal means problem\nThe normal means model is: \\[Y_i = \\beta_i + \\varepsilon_i, \\quad i = 1, \\ldots, n,\\] with \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) i.i.d. \\(\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)\\).\nFirst, we will be computing the posterior mean only, with known variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). The function HS.post.mean computes the posterior mean of \\((\\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_n)\\). It does not require MCMC and is suitable when only an estimate of the vector \\((\\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_n)\\) is desired. In case uncertainty quantification or variable selection is also of interest, or no good value for \\(\\sigma^2\\) is available, please see below for the function HS.normal.means.\nThe function HS.post.mean requires the observed outcomes, a value for \\(\\tau\\) and a value for \\(\\sigma\\). Ideally, \\(\\tau\\) should be equal to the proportion of nonzero \\(\\beta_i\\)’s. Typically, this proportion is unknown, in which case it is recommended to use the function HS.MMLE to find the marginal maximum likelihood estimator for \\(\\tau\\).\nAs an example, we generate 50 data points, the first 10 of which are coming from true signals. The first 10 \\(\\beta_i\\)’s are equal to five and the remaining \\(\\beta_i\\)’s are equal to zero. Let’s first plot the true parameters (black) and observations (blue).\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(index = 1:50,\n                 truth &lt;- c(rep(5, 10), rep(0, 40)),\n                 y &lt;- truth + rnorm(50) #observations\n                 )\n\nggplot(data = df, aes(x = index, y = truth)) + \n  geom_point(size = 2) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = index, y = y), size = 2, col = \"blue\") +\n  theme_classic() + ylab(\"\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Black = truth, Blue = observations\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe estimate \\(\\tau\\) using the MMLE, using the known variance.\n\n(tau.est &lt;- HS.MMLE(df$y, Sigma2 = 1))\n\n## [1] 0.79\n\n\nWe then use this estimate of \\(\\tau\\) to find the posterior mean, and add it to the plot in red.\n\npost.mean &lt;- HS.post.mean(df$y, tau.est, 1)\ndf$post.mean &lt;- post.mean\n\nggplot(data = df, aes(x = index, y = truth)) + \n  geom_point(size = 2) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = index, y = y), size = 2, col = \"blue\") +\n  theme_classic() + ylab(\"\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x = index, y = post.mean), size = 2, col = \"red\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Black = truth, Blue = observations, Red = estimates\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the posterior variance is of interest, the function HS.post.var can be used. It takes the same arguments as HS.post.mean.\n\n\nPosterior mean, credible intervals and variable selection, possibly unknown \\(\\sigma^2\\)\nThe function HS.normal.means is the main function to use for the normal means problem. It uses MCMC and results in an object that contains all MCMC samples as well as the posterior mean for all parameters (\\(\\beta_i\\)’s, \\(\\tau\\), \\(\\sigma\\)), the posterior median for the \\(\\beta_i\\)’s, and credible intervals for the \\(\\beta_i\\)’s.\nThe key choices to make are:\n\nHow to handle \\(\\tau\\). The recommended option is “truncatedCauchy” (a half-Cauchy prior truncated to \\([1/n, 1]\\)). See the manual for other options.\nHow to handle \\(\\sigma\\). The recommended option is “Jeffreys” (Jeffrey’s prior). See the manual for other options.\n\nOther options that can be set by the user are the level of the credible intervals (default is 95%), and the number of MCMC samples (default is 1000 burn-in samples and then 5000 more).\nLet’s continue the example from the previous section. We first create a ‘horseshoe object’.\n\nhs.object &lt;- HS.normal.means(df$y, method.tau = \"truncatedCauchy\", method.sigma = \"Jeffreys\")\n\nWe extract the posterior mean of the \\(\\beta_i\\)’s and plot them in red.\n\ndf$post.mean.full &lt;- hs.object$BetaHat\n\nggplot(data = df, aes(x = index, y = truth)) + \n  geom_point(size = 2) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = index, y = y), size = 2, col = \"blue\") +\n  theme_classic() + ylab(\"\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x = index, y = post.mean.full), size = 2, col = \"red\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Black = truth, Blue = observations, Red = estimates\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe plot the marginal credible intervals (and remove the observations from the plot for clarity).\n\ndf$lower.CI &lt;- hs.object$LeftCI\ndf$upper.CI &lt;- hs.object$RightCI\n\nggplot(data = df, aes(x = index, y = truth)) + \n  geom_point(size = 2) + \n  theme_classic() + ylab(\"\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x = index, y = post.mean.full), size = 2, col = \"red\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower.CI, ymax = upper.CI), width = .1, col = \"red\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Black = truth, Red = estimates with 95% credible intervals\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we perform variable selection using HS.var.select. In the normal means problem, we can use two decision rules. We will illustrate them both. The first method checks whether zero is contained in the credible interval, as studied by Van der Pas et al (2017).\n\ndf$selected.CI &lt;- HS.var.select(hs.object, df$y, method = \"intervals\")\n\nThe result is a vector of zeroes and ones, with the ones indicating that the observations is suspected to correspond to an actual signal. We now plot the results, coloring the estimates/intervals blue if a signal is detected and red otherwise.\n\nggplot(data = df, aes(x = index, y = truth)) + \n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  theme_classic() + ylab(\"\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x = index, y = post.mean.full, col = factor(selected.CI)), \n             size = 2) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower.CI, ymax = upper.CI, col = factor(selected.CI)),\n                width = .1) +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Black = truth, Blue = selected as signal, Red = selected as noise\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other variable selection method is the thresholding method of Carvalho et al (2010). The posterior mean can be written as \\(c_iy_i\\) where \\(y_i\\) is the observation and \\(c_i\\) some number between 0 and 1. A variable is selected if \\(c_i \\geq c\\) for some user-selected threshold \\(c\\) (default is \\(c = 0.5\\)). In the example:\n\ndf$selected.thres &lt;- HS.var.select(hs.object, df$y, method = \"threshold\")\n\n\nggplot(data = df, aes(x = index, y = truth)) + \n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  theme_classic() + ylab(\"\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x = index, y = post.mean.full, col = factor(selected.thres)), \n             size = 2) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower.CI, ymax = upper.CI, col = factor(selected.thres)),\n                width = .1) +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Black = truth, Blue = selected as signal, Red = selected as noise\")",

    "text": "18.13 Subset Selection (\\(\\ell_0\\) Norm)\nThe \\(\\ell_0\\) norm directly counts the number of non-zero parameters, making it the most natural penalty for variable selection. However, \\(\\ell_0\\)-regularized optimization problems are NP-hard due to their combinatorial nature. The optimization problem is:\n\\[\n\\min_{\\beta} \\frac{1}{2}\\|y - X\\beta\\|_2^2 + \\lambda \\|\\beta\\|_0\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\|\\beta\\|_0 = \\#\\{j : \\beta_j \\neq 0\\}\\) is the number of non-zero coefficients. This directly penalizes model complexity by limiting the number of active predictors.\n\nConnection to Spike-and-Slab Priors\nA remarkable connection exists between Bayesian spike-and-slab priors and \\(\\ell_0\\) regularization. Consider the spike-and-slab prior where each coefficient follows:\n\\[\n\\beta_j \\mid \\theta, \\sigma_\\beta^2 \\sim (1-\\theta)\\delta_0 + \\theta N(0, \\sigma_\\beta^2)\n\\]\nHere \\(\\theta \\in (0,1)\\) controls the sparsity level and \\(\\sigma_\\beta^2\\) governs the size of non-zero coefficients. This can be reparametrized using indicator variables \\(\\gamma_j \\in \\{0,1\\}\\) and continuous coefficients \\(\\alpha_j\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\beta_j &= \\gamma_j \\alpha_j \\\\\n\\gamma_j \\mid \\theta &\\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(\\theta) \\\\\n\\alpha_j \\mid \\sigma_\\beta^2 &\\sim N(0, \\sigma_\\beta^2)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator under this prior yields the objective:\n\\[\n\\min_{\\gamma, \\alpha} \\|y - X_\\gamma \\alpha_\\gamma\\|_2^2 + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sigma_\\beta^2}\\|\\alpha\\|_2^2 + 2\\sigma^2\\log\\left(\\frac{1-\\theta}{\\theta}\\right)\\|\\gamma\\|_0\n\\]\nwhere \\(X_\\gamma\\) contains only the columns corresponding to \\(\\gamma_j = 1\\). Under the assumptions \\(\\theta &lt; 1/2\\) (favoring sparsity) and \\(\\sigma_\\beta^2 \\gg \\sigma^2\\) (weak shrinkage on non-zero coefficients), this reduces to the \\(\\ell_0\\)-regularized least squares with \\(\\lambda = 2\\sigma^2\\log\\left(\\frac{1-\\theta}{\\theta}\\right)\\).\n\n\nSingle Best Replacement (SBR) Algorithm\nSince exact \\(\\ell_0\\) optimization is intractable, practical algorithms focus on finding good local optima. The Single Best Replacement (SBR) algorithm addresses the fundamental challenge in sparse regression: finding the optimal subset of predictors when the search space is exponentially large. For \\(p\\) predictors, there are \\(2^p\\) possible subsets to consider, making exhaustive search computationally prohibitive for even moderate \\(p\\).\nRather than searching over all possible coefficient vectors \\(\\beta\\), SBR reformulates the \\(\\ell_0\\)-regularized problem as a discrete optimization over active sets \\(S \\subseteq \\{1,2,\\ldots,p\\}\\):\n\\[\n\\min_{S} f(S) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|y - X_S \\hat{\\beta}_S\\|_2^2 + \\lambda |S|\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\beta}_S = (X_S^T X_S)^{-1} X_S^T y\\) is the least squares solution on the active set \\(S\\). This reformulation creates a natural bias-variance tradeoff where larger models with bigger active sets reduce bias but increase the penalty, while smaller models reduce the penalty but may increase bias.\nThe SBR algorithm operates through a systematic iterative process. The initialization phase begins with an empty active set \\(S_0 = \\emptyset\\), computes the initial objective \\(f(S_0) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|y\\|_2^2\\) (corresponding to no predictors), and sets the iteration counter \\(k = 0\\).\nThe main iteration loop proceeds as follows for each iteration \\(k\\). During candidate generation, the algorithm considers each variable \\(j \\in \\{1,\\ldots,p\\}\\) and defines the single replacement operation: \\[S_k \\cdot j = \\begin{cases}\nS_k \\cup \\{j\\} & \\text{if } j \\notin S_k \\text{ (addition)} \\\\\nS_k \\setminus \\{j\\} & \\text{if } j \\in S_k \\text{ (removal)}\n\\end{cases}\\]\nFor objective evaluation, each candidate \\(S_k \\cdot j\\) is assessed by computing: \\[f(S_k \\cdot j) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|y - X_{S_k \\cdot j} \\hat{\\beta}_{S_k \\cdot j}\\|_2^2 + \\lambda |S_k \\cdot j|\\]\nThe best replacement selection identifies: \\[j^* = \\arg\\min_{j \\in \\{1,\\ldots,p\\}} f(S_k \\cdot j)\\]\nFinally, the improvement check determines whether to accept the move: if \\(f(S_k \\cdot j^*) &lt; f(S_k)\\), the algorithm accepts the move and sets \\(S_{k+1} = S_k \\cdot j^*\\); otherwise, it stops and returns \\(S_k\\) as the final solution.\nUnlike pure forward selection which only adds variables or backward elimination which only removes variables, SBR can both add and remove variables at each step. This bidirectionality provides substantial advantages. The algorithm can escape local optima by correcting early mistakes through the removal of previously selected variables. When variables are correlated, the algorithm can swap between equivalent predictors to find better solutions. Additionally, the adaptive model size capability allows the algorithm to both grow and shrink the model as needed during the optimization process.\nWhen compared with standard stepwise methods, the advantages become clear. Forward selection uses greedy addition only and can become trapped if early selections are poor. Backward elimination starts with the full model, making it computationally expensive for large \\(p\\). Traditional forward-backward approaches use separate forward and backward phases, while SBR provides a unified framework that considers both additions and removals at each step.\nThe key computational challenge lies in evaluating \\(f(S \\cdot j)\\) for all \\(p\\) variables at each iteration, as naive implementation would require \\(p\\) separate least squares computations per iteration. Efficient matrix updates provide the solution to this challenge.\nFor the addition case where \\(j \\notin S\\), adding variable \\(j\\) to active set \\(S\\) employs rank-one updates to the Cholesky decomposition. If \\(X_S^T X_S = L_S L_S^T\\), then updating for \\(X_{S \\cup \\{j\\}}^T X_{S \\cup \\{j\\}}\\) requires only \\(O(|S|^2)\\) operations instead of \\(O(|S|^3)\\). Similarly, for the removal case where \\(j \\in S\\), removing variable \\(j\\) from active set \\(S\\) uses rank-one downdates to the Cholesky decomposition with similar \\(O(|S|^2)\\) complexity.\nThe overall computational complexity analysis reveals that each iteration requires \\(O(p|S|^2)\\) operations where \\(|S|\\) is the current active set size, the total number of iterations is typically \\(O(|S_{final}|)\\) in practice, and the overall complexity becomes \\(O(p|S|^3)\\), which is much more efficient than exhaustive search requiring \\(O(2^p)\\) operations.\n\nTheoretical Properties\nThe convergence properties of SBR are well-established. The algorithm demonstrates finite convergence, provably converging in finite steps since there are only finitely many possible active sets. It exhibits monotonic improvement where the objective function decreases or stays the same at each iteration. Finally, the algorithm achieves local optimality, with the final solution satisfying local optimality conditions.\nSBR can be viewed as a coordinate-wise proximal gradient method, establishing a connection to proximal gradient methods. The proximal operator for the \\(\\ell_0\\) norm is: \\[\\text{prox}_{\\lambda\\|\\cdot\\|_0}(z) = z \\odot \\mathbf{1}_{|z|&gt;\\sqrt{2\\lambda}}\\]\nThis hard thresholding operation is exactly what SBR implements in a coordinate-wise manner.\nUnder certain regularity conditions, SBR can achieve statistical consistency across multiple dimensions. It demonstrates variable selection consistency by correctly identifying the true active set with high probability. The algorithm provides estimation consistency through consistent estimates of the non-zero coefficients. Additionally, it achieves prediction consistency by attaining optimal prediction error rates.\n\n\nPractical Implementation Considerations\nSeveral practical considerations affect SBR implementation. For regularization parameter selection, cross-validation provides the standard approach but is computationally expensive, while information criteria such as BIC and AIC can provide faster alternatives. Stability selection offers another approach by running SBR on bootstrap samples and selecting stable variables.\nInitialization strategies vary in their effectiveness. The empty start approach using \\(S_0 = \\emptyset\\) is most common, while forward start begins with forward selection for a few steps. Random start employs multiple random initializations for better global search capabilities.\nHandling numerical issues requires attention to several factors. Multicollinearity concerns necessitate checking condition numbers of \\(X_S^T X_S\\). Rank deficiency situations require handling cases where \\(X_S\\) is rank deficient. Numerical stability can be improved by using QR decomposition instead of normal equations when needed.\n\n\nStatistical Properties and Performance\nEmpirical studies demonstrate that SBR achieves statistical performance comparable to the gold-standard spike-and-slab priors while being orders of magnitude faster. The algorithm shows superior variable selection performance compared to Lasso and elastic net in high-correlation settings, achieves lower mean squared error than convex relaxation methods for estimation accuracy, and provides better recovery of the true sparse structure compared to \\(\\ell_1\\) penalties for sparsity detection.\nThe connection between spike-and-slab priors and \\(\\ell_0\\) regularization provides theoretical justification for why SBR performs well: it approximates the MAP estimator of a principled Bayesian model while remaining computationally tractable.\n\n\nAdvantages and Limitations\nSBR offers several computational and theoretical advantages. The algorithm provides computational efficiency, running much faster than full Bayesian methods. It maintains a theoretical foundation through its principled connection to spike-and-slab priors. The approach demonstrates flexibility in handling various problem sizes and correlation structures. Finally, it produces sparse, interpretable models that enhance model interpretability.\nHowever, SBR also has certain limitations. The algorithm provides no guarantee of global optimality, potentially stopping at local optima. Its greedy nature may lead to suboptimal early decisions that affect the final solution. Performance sensitivity depends heavily on \\(\\lambda\\) selection, requiring careful parameter tuning. Additionally, the algorithm may struggle with highly correlated predictors in certain scenarios.\n\n\nExtensions and Variations\nSeveral extensions expand SBR’s applicability. Grouped SBR extends to group selection by replacing single variables with groups: \\[S \\cdot G = \\begin{cases}\nS \\cup G & \\text{if } G \\cap S = \\emptyset \\\\\nS \\setminus G & \\text{if } G \\subseteq S\n\\end{cases}\\]\nRegularization path computation involves computing solutions for a sequence of \\(\\lambda\\) values while using warm starts from previous solutions. Multiple best replacements consider the \\(k\\) best replacements at each step for more thorough search rather than restricting to single best replacement.\n\n\nProximal Perspective\nThe SBR algorithm can be deeply understood through the lens of proximal operators, which provides a unifying framework connecting discrete optimization, continuous optimization, and statistical estimation. This perspective reveals why SBR works well and connects it to a broader class of optimization algorithms.\n\n\nProximal Operator for the \\(\\ell_0\\) Norm\nThe proximal operator of a function \\(g: \\mathbb{R}^p \\to \\mathbb{R} \\cup \\{+\\infty\\}\\) is defined as: \\[\n\\text{prox}_{\\gamma g}(v) = \\arg\\min_{u} \\left\\{ g(u) + \\frac{1}{2\\gamma}\\|u - v\\|_2^2 \\right\\}\n\\]\nThis operator balances two competing objectives: function minimization by making \\(g(u)\\) small, and proximity by staying close to the input point \\(v\\). The parameter \\(\\gamma &gt; 0\\) controls the tradeoff between these objectives. The proximal operator generalizes the notion of gradient descent to non-smooth functions and provides a principled way to handle non-differentiable penalties.\nFor the \\(\\ell_0\\) penalty \\(g(\\beta) = \\lambda\\|\\beta\\|_0\\), the proximal operator has a particularly simple form:\n\\[\n\\text{prox}_{\\gamma \\lambda \\|\\cdot\\|_0}(v) = \\arg\\min_{\\beta} \\left\\{ \\lambda\\|\\beta\\|_0 + \\frac{1}{2\\gamma}\\|\\beta - v\\|_2^2 \\right\\}\n\\]\nThe solution is given by hard thresholding: \\[\n[\\text{prox}_{\\gamma \\lambda \\|\\cdot\\|_0}(v)]_j = \\begin{cases}\nv_j & \\text{if } |v_j| &gt; \\sqrt{2\\gamma\\lambda} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThis can be written compactly as: \\[\n\\text{prox}_{\\gamma \\lambda \\|\\cdot\\|_0}(v) = v \\odot \\mathbf{1}_{|v| &gt; \\sqrt{2\\gamma\\lambda}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\odot\\) denotes element-wise multiplication and \\(\\mathbf{1}_{|v| &gt; \\sqrt{2\\gamma\\lambda}}\\) is the indicator vector.\nThe general proximal gradient method for solving \\(\\min_{\\beta} f(\\beta) + g(\\beta)\\) (where \\(f\\) is smooth and \\(g\\) is potentially non-smooth) proceeds by:\n\\[\n\\beta^{(k+1)} = \\text{prox}_{\\gamma_k g}\\left(\\beta^{(k)} - \\gamma_k \\nabla f(\\beta^{(k)})\\right)\n\\]\nFor the \\(\\ell_0\\)-regularized least squares problem, we have \\(f(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|y - X\\beta\\|_2^2\\) (smooth, quadratic), \\(g(\\beta) = \\lambda\\|\\beta\\|_0\\) (non-smooth, combinatorial), and \\(\\nabla f(\\beta) = X^T(X\\beta - y)\\).\nThe proximal gradient update becomes: \\[\n\\beta^{(k+1)} = \\text{prox}_{\\gamma_k \\lambda \\|\\cdot\\|_0}\\left(\\beta^{(k)} - \\gamma_k X^T(X\\beta^{(k)} - y)\\right)\n\\]\nThis is exactly iterative hard thresholding (IHT), a well-known algorithm for sparse optimization.\nWhile SBR doesn’t explicitly compute the full proximal gradient step, it implements the same underlying principle in a coordinate-wise manner through coordinate selection where SBR considers each coordinate \\(j\\) individually, local optimization where each coordinate solves the reduced problem, and hard thresholding where the decision to include or exclude a variable is equivalent to hard thresholding.\nSpecifically, when SBR considers adding variable \\(j\\) to the active set \\(S\\), it’s effectively solving: \\[\n\\min_{\\beta_j} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{2}\\|r_{-j} - x_j \\beta_j\\|_2^2 + \\lambda \\mathbf{1}_{\\beta_j \\neq 0} \\right\\}\n\\]\nwhere \\(r_{-j}\\) is the residual after fitting all other active variables. The solution is: \\[\n\\hat{\\beta}_j = \\begin{cases}\n(x_j^T r_{-j})/(x_j^T x_j) & \\text{if } \\frac{1}{2}(x_j^T r_{-j})^2/(x_j^T x_j) &gt; \\lambda \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThis is precisely the coordinate-wise hard thresholding operation.\nLasso (\\(\\ell_1\\) penalty): \\[\n\\text{prox}_{\\gamma \\lambda \\|\\cdot\\|_1}(v) = \\text{sign}(v) \\odot \\max(|v| - \\gamma\\lambda, 0)\n\\] This is soft thresholding, which shrinks coefficients gradually toward zero.\nRidge (\\(\\ell_2\\) penalty): \\[\n\\text{prox}_{\\gamma \\lambda \\|\\cdot\\|_2^2}(v) = \\frac{v}{1 + 2\\gamma\\lambda}\n\\] This applies uniform shrinkage to all coefficients.\nElastic Net: Combines soft thresholding with uniform shrinkage.\nThe key difference is that hard thresholding (SBR/\\(\\ell_0\\)) makes discrete decisions (include/exclude), while soft thresholding (Lasso) makes continuous shrinkage decisions.\n\n\nTheoretical Insights from Proximal Perspective\nFixed Point Characterization: A point \\(\\beta^*\\) is a stationary point of the \\(\\ell_0\\)-regularized problem if and only if: \\[\n\\beta^* = \\text{prox}_{\\gamma \\lambda \\|\\cdot\\|_0}(\\beta^* - \\gamma \\nabla f(\\beta^*))\n\\]\nThis provides a theoretical characterization of SBR’s stopping condition.\nThe proximal perspective allows us to leverage convergence theory from proximal gradient methods, providing subsequential convergence to stationary points, linear convergence under restricted strong convexity conditions, and global convergence for coordinate descent variants.\nRegularization Path: The proximal perspective explains why SBR produces piecewise-constant regularization paths. As \\(\\lambda\\) varies, the hard thresholding boundary \\(\\sqrt{2\\gamma\\lambda}\\) changes, leading to discrete changes in the active set.\n\n\nExtensions and Generalizations\nBlock Proximal Operators: For grouped variables, define block hard thresholding: \\[\n[\\text{prox}_{\\gamma \\lambda \\|\\cdot\\|_{0,\\text{group}}}(v)]_G = \\begin{cases}\nv_G & \\text{if } \\frac{1}{2}\\|v_G\\|_2^2 &gt; \\gamma\\lambda \\\\\n\\mathbf{0} & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nAdaptive Thresholding: Use different thresholds for different coordinates: \\[\n[\\text{prox}_{\\gamma \\Lambda \\|\\cdot\\|_0}(v)]_j = v_j \\mathbf{1}_{|v_j| &gt; \\sqrt{2\\gamma\\lambda_j}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Lambda = \\text{diag}(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_p)\\).\nSmoothed Proximal Operators: Approximate hard thresholding with smooth functions for better optimization properties: \\[\n\\text{prox}_{\\gamma g_\\epsilon}(v) \\approx \\text{prox}_{\\gamma \\lambda \\|\\cdot\\|_0}(v)\n\\]\nwhere \\(g_\\epsilon\\) is a smooth approximation to \\(\\lambda\\|\\cdot\\|_0\\).\n\n\nComputational Advantages\nThe proximal perspective reveals several computational advantages of SBR. The \\(\\ell_0\\) proximal operator demonstrates separability across coordinates, enabling parallel computation. Each coordinate subproblem has exact closed-form solutions, eliminating the need for iterative solvers. Hard thresholding operations require only efficient comparison operations rather than complex numerical computations. Finally, previous solutions provide excellent warm start initializations for nearby parameter values in regularization path computations.\nThis perspective unifies SBR with other sparsity-inducing algorithms and provides a theoretical foundation for understanding its behavior and developing extensions.\n\n\nSpike-and-Slab Examples: Bernoulli-Gaussian and Bernoulli-Laplace\nTo illustrate the practical implications of different spike-and-slab priors in the proximal framework, we examine two important cases: Bernoulli-Gaussian and Bernoulli-Laplace priors. These examples demonstrate how different prior specifications lead to different shrinkage behaviors and associated penalty functions.\nFor the normal means problem where \\(y \\mid \\beta \\sim N(\\beta, \\sigma^2)\\) with Bernoulli-Gaussian prior \\(\\beta \\sim (1-\\theta)\\delta_0 + \\theta N(0, \\sigma_\\beta^2)\\), the marginal distribution of \\(y\\) is: \\[\ny \\mid \\theta \\sim (1-\\theta) N(0, \\sigma^2) + \\theta N(0, \\sigma^2 + \\sigma_\\beta^2)\n\\]\nThe posterior mean takes the form: \\[\n\\hat{\\beta}^{BG} = w(y) y\n\\] where the weight function is: \\[\nw(y) = \\frac{\\sigma_\\beta^2}{\\sigma^2 + \\sigma_\\beta^2} \\left(1 + \\frac{(1-\\theta)\\phi(y/\\sigma)}{\\theta\\phi(y/\\sqrt{\\sigma^2 + \\sigma_\\beta^2})\\sqrt{1 + \\sigma_\\beta^2/\\sigma^2}}\\right)^{-1}\n\\]\nand \\(\\phi(\\cdot)\\) denotes the standard normal density.\nFor the Bernoulli-Laplace prior \\(\\beta \\sim (1-\\theta)\\delta_0 + \\theta \\text{Laplace}(0, b)\\), the expressions become more complex, involving the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\n\n\nPosterior mean functions for Bernoulli-Gaussian (left) and Bernoulli-Laplace (right) priors\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\n# Parameters\ny_vals &lt;- seq(-5, 5, length.out = 1000)\nsigma &lt;- 1\ntheta &lt;- 0.1\nsigma_beta_vals &lt;- c(0.5, 1, 2)\n\n# Bernoulli-Gaussian posterior mean\nbg_posterior_mean &lt;- function(y, sigma, theta, sigma_beta) {\n  var_spike &lt;- sigma^2\n  var_slab &lt;- sigma^2 + sigma_beta^2\n  \n  weight_factor &lt;- (1 -

When the slab variance \\(\\sigma_\\beta^2\\) (or scale parameter \\(b\\)) is small, Bernoulli-Gaussian priors behave similarly to ridge regression, applying excessive shrinkage to large observations. In contrast, Bernoulli-Laplace priors exhibit behavior more similar to Lasso, with softer shrinkage characteristics.\nAs the slab parameters increase, both priors approach hard thresholding behavior, and their associated penalty functions \\(\\phi\\) become increasingly similar to non-convex penalties such as SCAD. The penalty functions reveal the “spiky” nature around zero that induces sparsity for small observations, while the different tail behaviors reflect the distinct shrinkage properties of Gaussian versus Laplace slab components.",

    "text": "18.14 Advanced Topics in Regularization\n\nTikhonov Regularization Framework\nThe Tikhonov regularization framework provides a general setting for regression that connects classical regularization theory with modern Bayesian approaches. Given observed data \\((x_i, y_i)_{i=1}^n\\) and a parametric model \\(f(x,w)\\) with parameter vector \\(w \\in \\mathbb{R}^k\\), we define a data misfit functional: \\[\nE_D(w) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f(x_i,w))^2\n\\]\nThis yields a Gaussian likelihood: \\[\np(y \\mid w) = \\frac{1}{Z_D}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}E_D(w)\\right)\n\\] where \\(\\sigma^2\\) denotes the noise variance and \\(Z_D\\) is a normalization constant.\nA Gaussian prior on the weights can be specified as: \\[\np(w) = \\frac{1}{Z_W}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma_w^2}E_W(w)\\right)\n\\] where \\(E_W(w)\\) denotes a quadratic penalty on \\(w\\) (e.g., \\(E_W(w) = w^T w\\)), \\(\\sigma_w^2\\) is the prior variance, and \\(Z_W\\) is its normalization constant.\nThe hyperparameters \\(\\sigma^2\\) and \\(\\sigma_w^2\\) control the strength of the noise and the prior. Following MacKay’s notation, we define precisions \\(\\tau_D^2 = 1/\\sigma^2\\) and \\(\\tau_w^2 = 1/\\sigma_w^2\\). Let \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) denote the Hessians of \\(E_D(w)\\) and \\(E_W(w)\\) at the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate \\(w^{\\text{MAP}}\\). The Hessian of the negative log-posterior is then \\(A = \\tau_w^2 C + \\tau_D^2 B\\).\nEvaluating the log-evidence under a Gaussian Laplace approximation yields: \\[\n\\log p(D \\mid \\tau_w^2,\\tau_D^2) = -\\tau_w^2 E_W^{\\text{MAP}} - \\tau_D^2 E_D^{\\text{MAP}} - \\frac{1}{2}\\log\\det A - \\log Z_W(\\tau_w^2) - \\log Z_D(\\tau_D^2) + \\frac{k}{2}\\log(2\\pi)\n\\]\nThe associated Occam factor, which penalizes excessively small prior variances, is: \\[\n-\\tau_w^2 E_W^{\\text{MAP}} - \\frac{1}{2}\\log\\det A - \\log Z_W(\\tau_w^2)\n\\]\nThis represents the reduction in effective volume of parameter space from prior to posterior.\n\n\nGeneralized Ridge Regression in the Canonical Basis\nWe revisit ridge regression from the perspective of the canonical coordinate system, using the singular value decomposition \\(X = UDW^T\\) and rotated coefficients \\(\\alpha = W^T\\beta\\). In this basis: \\[\nY = X\\beta + \\epsilon = UD\\alpha + \\epsilon\n\\]\nProjecting onto \\(U\\): \\[\n\\hat{\\alpha}_i = \\alpha_i + \\epsilon_i, \\quad \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2/d_i^2)\n\\]\nWith independent priors \\(\\alpha_i \\sim N(0, v_i)\\), the posterior mean yields a shrinkage estimator: \\[\n\\alpha_i^* = \\kappa_i \\hat{\\alpha}_i, \\quad \\text{with} \\quad \\kappa_i = \\frac{d_i^2}{d_i^2 + k_i}\n\\] where \\(k_i = \\sigma^2/v_i\\) is the generalized ridge penalty.\nThis framework offers componentwise optimality and anticipates global-local shrinkage priors where individual parameters receive adaptive regularization.\n\n\nTrend Filtering and Composite Penalties\nTrend filtering provides an example of regularized least squares with composite penalty, useful when a 1D signal has jumps at few positions: \\[\n\\hat{\\beta} = \\arg\\min_{\\beta} \\left\\{\\frac{1}{2}\\|y - \\beta\\|_2^2 + \\lambda\\phi(D\\beta)\\right\\}\n\\] where \\(D\\) is the difference matrix and \\(\\phi\\) is a penalty function that encourages sparsity in the differences, leading to piecewise-constant or piecewise-polynomial solutions.\nThe evolution from maximum likelihood estimation to sophisticated Bayesian regularization represents more than technical progress—it reflects a fundamental shift in how we approach learning from data. Rather than seeking single “best” estimates, modern methods embrace uncertainty, incorporate prior knowledge, and adaptively balance model complexity with empirical fit.\nThe remarkable fact that Bayesian approaches often dominate classical frequentist methods, even from a frequentist perspective (as demonstrated by Stein’s paradox), suggests that probabilistic thinking provides not just philosophical appeal but concrete practical advantages. In an era of ever-growing data complexity and dimensionality, these theoretical insights become increasingly valuable for developing robust, interpretable, and effective learning algorithms.\nThe unified framework presented in this chapter—connecting classical statistics, Bayesian inference, optimization theory, and modern machine learning—provides both historical perspective and forward-looking guidance for the continued development of artificial intelligence systems. As we confront increasingly complex learning challenges, from personalized medicine to autonomous systems, the principled approach to regularization and uncertainty quantification developed here will remain fundamental to building trustworthy and effective AI systems.",

    "section": "18.15 Final Thoughts",
    "text": "18.15 Final Thoughts\nOur exploration began with a sobering revelation: the maximum likelihood estimator, long considered the gold standard of classical statistics, is inadmissible in high-dimensional settings. Stein’s paradox demonstrates that for \\(p \\geq 3\\) dimensions, there always exist estimators with uniformly lower risk than the MLE. This is not merely a theoretical curiosity—in the normal means problem with \\(p=100\\), the James-Stein estimator can achieve 67 times lower risk than the MLE. This dramatic improvement illustrates why classical approaches often fail in modern high-dimensional problems and why shrinkage methods have become essential tools in contemporary data science.\nThe James-Stein estimator’s success stems from its ability to “borrow strength” across components through global shrinkage, demonstrating that multivariate estimation problems are fundamentally easier than their univariate counterparts when approached with appropriate regularization. However, global shrinkage alone is insufficient for sparse signals, motivating the development of more sophisticated approaches that can adapt to local signal structure.\nA central theme throughout this chapter is the profound duality between Bayesian priors and regularization penalties. Every regularization term \\(\\lambda \\phi(f)\\) corresponds to a prior distribution through the relationship \\(\\phi(f) = -\\log p(f)\\), making maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation equivalent to penalized optimization. This duality provides both theoretical justification for regularization methods and practical guidance for prior specification:\n\nPenalty types and their corresponding prior distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nPenalty\nPrior\nKey Property/Behavior\n\n\n\n\nRidge\n\\(\\theta^2\\)\nGaussian\nGrows Quadratically.

The \\(\\ell_2\\) (Ridge) penalty creates a circular unit ball that encourages smoothness across all parameters. The \\(\\ell_1\\) (Lasso) penalty forms a diamond shape that induces sparsity through soft thresholding. Bridge penalties with \\(\\alpha = 0.5\\) create more pointed shapes that provide stronger sparsity than Lasso, while \\(\\alpha = 1.5\\) produces shapes between the diamond and circle. The \\(\\ell_0\\) penalty reduces to discrete points on the coordinate axes, representing exact subset selection.\nFigure 18.6 (b) shows the unit balls for penalty norms induced by the horseshoe prior. Visually, it looks similar to the unit ball induced by the bridge prior with \\(\\alpha = 0.5\\). It demonstrates several remarkable properties that make it particularly effective for sparse estimation problems. Its penalty function \\(\\phi(\\theta_i) = -\\log(\\log(1 + 2\\tau^2/\\theta_i^2))\\) exhibits a unique double-logarithmic structure that creates an ideal balance between sparsity induction and signal preservation.\nThe horseshoe’s most distinctive characteristic is its asymmetric shrinkage behavior. Near the origin, when parameters approach zero, the penalty function grows to infinity, creating extremely strong shrinkage that encourages exact zeros and thus induces sparsity. However, for large parameter values, the penalty grows slowly, allowing large signals to escape penalization with minimal distortion. This behavior is fundamentally different from methods like Lasso, which applies uniform shrinkage regardless of signal magnitude.\nThe global shrinkage parameter \\(\\tau\\) provides crucial control over the prior’s behavior. Smaller values of \\(\\tau\\) impose more aggressive shrinkage across all parameters, while larger values become more permissive, allowing signals to emerge more easily. This parameter effectively controls the trade-off between sparsity and signal detection.\nFrom a theoretical perspective, the horseshoe prior achieves optimal minimax convergence rates of \\(O(s \\log(p/s))\\) for \\(s\\)-sparse vectors, making it particularly well-suited for “needle-in-a-haystack” problems where researchers seek to identify a few large signals among many noise variables. Under appropriate regularity conditions, the horseshoe also possesses oracle properties, meaning it can correctly identify the true signal structure.\nThe geometric visualization reveals why this prior is so effective. The characteristic “horseshoe” shape displays concave contours near the coordinate axes, reflecting strong shrinkage toward zero, while showing convex contours away from the origin, indicating minimal shrinkage for large coefficients. Unlike the Lasso’s diamond shape or Ridge’s circular contours, the horseshoe’s heavy tails allow large coefficients to escape penalization entirely.\nThis comprehensive visualization demonstrates why the horseshoe prior has become increasingly popular for modern high-dimensional problems where the true signal structure is sparse but individual signals may be large in magnitude. The prior’s ability to provide aggressive shrinkage for noise while preserving signal integrity makes it an ideal choice for contemporary machine learning applications.\nFigure 18.6 (c) shows the unit ball for the Cauchy prior. It demonstrates several remarkable properties that make it particularly effective for sparse estimation problems. Its penalty function \\(\\phi(\\theta_i) = \\log(1 + \\theta_i^2)\\) exhibits a unique logarithmic structure that creates an ideal balance between sparsity induction and signal preservation.\nThe Cauchy prior’s most distinctive characteristic is its heavy-tailed behavior. Near the origin, when parameters approach zero, the penalty function grows logarithmically, creating extremely strong shrinkage that encourages exact zeros and thus induces sparsity. However, for large parameter values, the penalty grows slowly, allowing large signals to escape penalization with minimal distortion. This behavior is fundamentally different from methods like Lasso, which applies uniform shrinkage regardless of signal magnitude.\nThe global shrinkage parameter \\(\\tau\\) provides crucial control over the prior’s behavior. Smaller values of \\(\\tau\\) impose more aggressive shrinkage across all parameters, while larger values become more permissive, allowing signals to emerge more easily. This parameter effectively controls the trade-off between sparsity and signal detection.\nOur analysis reveals a rich spectrum of approaches to sparsity, each with distinct theoretical properties and practical advantages:\n\nTable: Method categories and their key properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod Category\nExamples\nKey Properties\nAdvantages\nLimitations\n\n\n\n\nGlobal shrinkage methods\nJames-Stein, Ridge regression\nUniform regularization across all parameters\nComputationally simple and numerically stable\nCannot adapt to local signal structure; may over-shrink large signals in sparse settings\n\n\nAdaptive shrinkage methods\nLasso, horseshoe priors\nDifferential shrinkage based on signal strength\nLasso: soft thresholding; Horseshoe: aggressive shrinkage for small signals while preserving large ones; achieves optimal minimax rate \\(p_n \\log(n/p_n)\\)\nHorseshoe particularly effective for “needle-in-a-haystack” problems\n\n\nVariable selection methods\nSpike-and-slab priors, \\(\\ell_0\\) regularization\nDiscrete inclusion/exclusion decisions\nMost interpretable sparse solutions; can achieve oracle properties under appropriate conditions\nCombinatorially challenging\n\n\n\nBuilding on the theoretical foundations and geometric intuition developed above, we can distill several actionable guidelines for practitioners and researchers working with regularized models and sparse estimation.

Deep learning architectures routinely employ regularization techniques (dropout, weight decay, batch normalization) that can be understood through the Bayesian lens developed in this chapter. The success of techniques like variational autoencoders and Bayesian neural networks demonstrates the continued relevance of probabilistic thinking in contemporary machine learning.\nMoreover, the sparse estimation techniques discussed here are fundamental to interpretable AI, compressed sensing, and efficient neural architecture design. The theoretical insights about when different regularization approaches succeed provide guidance for designing and analyzing complex learning systems.\nThe evolution from maximum likelihood estimation to sophisticated Bayesian regularization represents more than technical progress—it reflects a fundamental shift in how we approach learning from data. Rather than seeking single “best” estimates, modern methods embrace uncertainty, incorporate prior knowledge, and adaptively balance model complexity with empirical fit.\nThe remarkable fact that Bayesian approaches often dominate classical frequentist methods, even from a frequentist perspective (as demonstrated by Stein’s paradox), suggests that probabilistic thinking provides not just philosophical appeal but concrete practical advantages. In an era of ever-growing data complexity and dimensionality, these theoretical insights become increasingly valuable for developing robust, interpretable, and effective learning algorithms.\nThe unified framework presented in this chapter—connecting classical statistics, Bayesian inference, optimization theory, and modern machine learning—provides both historical perspective and forward-looking guidance for the continued development of artificial intelligence systems. As we confront increasingly complex learning challenges, from personalized medicine to autonomous systems, the principled approach to regularization and uncertainty quantification developed here will remain fundamental to building trustworthy and effective AI systems.\n\n\n\n\nAndrews, D.

    "text": "19.1 Introduction\nThe goal of this section is to provide an overview of Deep Learning (DL). To do this, we have discussed the model estimation procedure and demonstrated that DL is an extension of a generalized linear model. One goal of statistics is to build predictive models along with uncertainty and to develop an understanding of the data generating mechanism. Data models are well studied in statistical literature, but often do not provide enough flexibility to learn the input-output relations. Closed box predictive rules, such as trees and neural networks, are more flexible learners. However, in high-dimensional problems, finding good models is challenging, and this is where deep learning methods shine. We can think of deterministic DL model as a transformation of high dimensional input and outputs. Hidden features lie on the transformed space, and are empirically learned as opposed to theoretically specified.\nAlthough DL models have been almost exclusively used for problems of image analysis and natural language processing, more traditional data sets, which arise in finance, science and engineering, such as spatial and temporal data can be efficiently analyzed using deep learning. Thus, DL provides an alternative for applications where traditional statistical techniques apply. There are a number of areas of future research for Statisticians. In particular, uncertainty quantification and model selection, such as architecture design, as well as algorithmic improvements and Bayesian deep learning. We hope this review will make DL models accessible for statisticians.\nIn recent years neural networks and deep learning have re-emerged as a dominant technology for natural language processing (NLP), image analysis and reinforcement learning. The majority of applications use feed-forward neural network architectures such as convolutional neural networks and transformers. In this chapter we will focus on the feed-forward neural networks and their applications to regression and classification problems. We will also discuss the computational aspects of deep learning and its implementation in R and Python.\nOur goal is to provide a review of deep learning methods which provide insight into structured high-dimensional data. Rather than using shallow additive architectures common to most statistical models, deep learning uses layers of semi-affine input transformations to provide a predictive rule. Applying these layers of transformations leads to a set of attributes (or, features) to which probabilistic statistical methods can be applied. Thus, the best of both worlds can be achieved: scalable prediction rules fortified with uncertainty quantification, where sparse regularization finds the features.\nDeep learning is one of the widely used machine learning methods for analysis of large-scale and high-dimensional data sets. Large-scale means that we have many samples (observations) and high dimensional means that each sample is a vector with many entries, usually hundreds and up.\nMachine learning is the engineer’s version of statistical data analysis. The major difference between ML and statistics is that ML focuses on practical aspects, such as computational efficiency and ease of use of techniques, while statistical analysis is more concerned with the rigorousness of the analysis and interpretability of the results.\nDeep learning provides a powerful pattern matching tool suitable for many AI applications. Image recognition and text analysis are probably two of deep learning’s most successful applications. From a computational perspective, you can think of an image or text as high-dimensional matrices and vectors, respectively. The problem of recognizing objects in images or translating a text requires designing complex decision boundaries in the high dimensional space of inputs.\nAlthough image analysis and natural language processing are the applications where deep learning is the dominating approach, more traditional engineering and science applications, such as spatio-temporal and financial analysis, are where DL has also shown superior performance compared to traditional statistical learning techniques (N. Polson, Sokolov, and Xu 2021; Nicholas G. Polson, Sokolov, et al. 2017; Dixon, Polson, and Sokolov 2019; Sokolov 2017; Bhadra et al. 2021, 2021; Behnia, Karbowski, and Sokolov 2021; Nareklishvili, Polson, and Sokolov 2022, 2023b, 2023a; Nicholas G. Polson and Sokolov 2023; N. Polson and Sokolov 2020)\nThere are several deep learning architectures - each has its own uses and purposes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) deal with 2-dimensional input objects, i.e., images, and have been shown to outperform other techniques. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have shown the best performance on speech and text analysis tasks.\nIn general, a neural network can be described as follows. Let \\(f_1 , \\ldots , f_L\\) be given univariate activation functions for each of the \\(L\\) layers. Activation functions are nonlinear transformations of weighted data. A semi-affine activation rule is then defined by \\[\nf_l^{W,b} = f_l \\left ( \\sum_{j=1}^{N_l} W_{lj} X_j + b_l \\right ) = f_l ( W_l X_l + b_l )\\,\n\\] which implicitly needs the specification of the number of hidden units \\(N_l\\). Our deep predictor, given the number of layers \\(L\\), then becomes the composite map\n\\[\n\\hat{Y}(X) = F(X) = \\left ( f_l^{W_1,b_1} \\circ \\ldots \\circ f_L^{W_L,b_L} \\right ) ( X)\\,.\n\\]\nThe fact that DL forms a universal “basis” which we recognize in this formulation dates to Poincare and Hilbert is central. From a practical perspective, given a large enough data set of “test cases”, we can empirically learn an optimal predictor. Similar to a classic basis decomposition, the deep approach uses univariate activation functions to decompose a high dimensional \\(X\\).\nLet \\(Z^{(l)}\\) denote the \\(l\\)th layer, and so \\(X = Z^{(0)}\\). The final output \\(Y\\) can be numeric or categorical. The explicit structure of a deep prediction rule is then \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{Y} (X) & = W^{(L)} Z^{(L)} + b^{(L)} \\\\\nZ^{(1)} & = f^{(1)} \\left ( W^{(0)} X + b^{(0)} \\right ) \\\\\nZ^{(2)} & = f^{(2)} \\left ( W^{(1)} Z^{(1)} + b^{(1)} \\right ) \\\\\n\\ldots  & \\\\\nZ^{(L)} & = f^{(L)} \\left ( W^{(L-1)} Z^{(L-1)} + b^{(L-1)} \\right )\\,.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Here \\(W^{(l)}\\) is a weight matrix and \\(b^{(l)}\\) are threshold or activation levels. Designing a good predictor depends crucially on the choice of univariate activation functions \\(f^{(l)}\\). The \\(Z^{(l)}\\) are hidden features which the algorithm will extract.\nPut differently, the deep approach employs hierarchical predictors comprising a series of \\(L\\) nonlinear transformations applied to \\(X\\). Each of the \\(L\\) transformations is referred to as a layer, where the original input is \\(X\\), the output of the first transformation is the first layer, and so on, with the output \\(\\hat Y\\) as the final layer. The layers \\(1\\) to \\(L\\) are called hidden layers. The number of layers \\(L\\) represents the depth of our network.",

    "text": "19.2 Motivating Examples\nInteraction terms, \\(x_1 x_2\\) and \\((x_1 x_2)^2\\), and max functions, \\(\\max(x_1, x_2)\\) can be expressed as nonlinear functions of semi-affine combinations. Specifically:\n\\[\nx_1x_2 = \\frac{1}{4} ( x_1+x_2 )^2 - \\frac{1}{4} (x_1-x_2)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\max(x_1,x_2) = \\frac{1}{2} | x_1+x_2 | + \\frac{1}{2} | x_1-x_2 |\n\\]\n\\[\n(x_1x_2)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} ( x_1+x_2 )^4 + \\frac{7}{4 \\cdot 3^3} (x_1-x_2)^4 - \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3^3} ( x_1+ 2 x_2)^4 - \\frac{2^3}{3^3} ( x_1 + \\frac{1}{2} x_2 )^4\n\\]\nDiaconis and Shahshahani (1981) provides further discussion for Projection Pursuit Regression, where the network uses a layered model \\(\\sum_{i=1}^N f ( w_i^\\top X )\\). They provide an ergodic view of composite iterated functions, a precursor to the use of multiple layers of single operators that can model complex multivariate systems.\nDeep ReLU architectures can be viewed as Max-Sum networks via the following simple identity. Define \\(x^+ = \\max(x,0)\\). Let \\(f_x(b) = (x + b)^+\\) where \\(b\\) is an offset. Then \\((x + y^+)^+ = \\max(0, x, x+y)\\). This is generalized in Feller (1971) (p.272) who shows by induction that\n\\[\n( f_{x_1} \\circ \\ldots \\circ f_{x_k} ) (0) = ( x_1 + ( x_2 + \\ldots + ( x_{k-1} + x_k^+ )^+ )^+ = \\max_{1 \\leq j \\leq k} ( x_1 + \\ldots + x_j )^+\n\\]\nA composition or convolution of \\(\\max\\)-layers is then a one layer max-sum network.\nAuto-encoding is an important data reduction technique. An auto-encoder is a deep learning architecture designed to replicate \\(X\\) itself, namely \\(X=Y\\), via a bottleneck structure. This means we select a model \\(F^{W,b}(X)\\) which aims to concentrate the information required to recreate \\(X\\). See Heaton et al (2017) for an application to smart indexing in finance.\nSuppose that we have \\(N\\) input vectors \\(X = \\{ x_1 , \\ldots , x_N \\} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M\\times N}\\) and \\(N\\) output (or target) vectors \\(\\{ x_1 , \\ldots , x_N \\} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M\\times N}\\). Setting biases to zero, for the purpose of illustration, and using only one hidden layer (\\(L=2\\)) with \\(K &lt; N\\) factors, gives for \\(j=1, \\ldots, N\\):\n\\[\nY_j(x) = F^m_{W} ( X )_j = \\sum_{k=1}^K W^{jk}_2 f \\left ( \\sum_{i=1}^N W^{ki}_1 x_i \\right ) =  \\sum_{k=1}^K W^{jk}_2 Z_j \\quad \\text{for } Z_j =  f \\left ( \\sum_{i=1}^N W^{ki}_1 x_i \\right )\n\\]\nSince, in an auto-encoder, we fit the model \\(X = F_{W}( X)\\), and train the weights \\(W = (W_1, W_2)\\) with regularization penalty in a\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L} ( W )  =  \\operatorname{argmin}_W \\Vert X - F_W (X) \\Vert^2  + \\lambda \\phi(W)\n\\]\nwith\n\\[\n\\phi(W) = \\sum_{i,j,k} | W^{jk}_1 |^2 +  | W^{ki}_2 |^2.\n\\]\nWriting the DL objective as an augmented Lagrangian (as in ADMM) with a hidden factor \\(Z\\), leads to a two step algorithm: an encoding step (a penalty for \\(Z\\)), and a decoding step for reconstructing the output signal via\n\\[\n\\operatorname{argmin}_{W,Z} \\Vert X - W_2 Z \\Vert^2 + \\lambda \\phi(Z) + \\Vert Z -  f( W_1, X ) \\Vert^2,\n\\]\nwhere the regularization on \\(W_1\\) induces a penalty on \\(Z\\). The last term is the encoder, the first two the decoder.\nIf \\(W_2\\) is estimated from the structure of the training data matrix, then we have a traditional factor model, and the \\(W_1\\) matrix provides the factor loadings. PCA, PLS, SIR fall into this category (see Cook 2007 for further discussion). If \\(W_2\\) is trained based on the pair \\(\\hat{X}=\\{Y,X\\}\\) then we have a sliced inverse regression model. If \\(W_1\\) and \\(W_2\\) are simultaneously estimated based on the training data \\(X\\), then we have a two layer deep learning model.\nAuto-encoding demonstrates that deep learning does not directly model variance-covariance matrix explicitly as the architecture is already in predictive form. Given a hierarchical non-linear combination of deep learners, an implicit variance-covariance matrix exists, but that is not the driver of the algorithm.\nAnother interesting area for future research are long short term memory models (LSTMs). For example, a dynamic one layer auto-encoder for a financial time series \\((Y_t)\\) is a coupled system of the form\n\\[\nY_t = W_x X _t + W_y Y_{t-1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\begin{pmatrix} X_t \\\\ Y_{t-1} \\end{pmatrix} = W Y_t\n\\]\nHere, the state equation encodes and the matrix \\(W\\) decodes the \\(Y_t\\) vector into its history \\(Y_{t-1}\\) and the current state \\(X_t\\).\nWe will start with applying a feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer to a problem of binary classification on a simulated data set. We start by generating a simple dataset shown in Figure below. The data is generated from a mixture of two distributions (Gaussian and truncated Gaussian). The red points are the positive class and the green points are the negative class. The goal is to find a model boundary that discriminates the two classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s try to use a simple logistic regression model to separate the two classes.\n\n# Fit a logistic regression model\nfit = glm(label~x1+x2, data=as.data.frame(d), family=binomial(link='logit'))\n# Plot the training dataset\nplot(d[,2],d[,3], col=d[,1]+2, pch=16, xlab=\"x1\", ylab=\"x2\")\nth = fit$coefficients\n# Plot the decision boundary\nabline(-th[1]/th[3], -th[2]/th[3], col=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that a logistic regression could not do it. It uses a single line to separate observations of two classes. We can see that the data is not linearly separable. However, we can use multiple lines to separate the data.\n\nplot(x1~x2, data=d,col=d[,1]+2, pch=16)\n# Plot lines that separate once class (red) from another (green)\nlines(x1, -x1 - 6); text(-4,-3,1)\nlines(x1, -x1 + 6); text(4,3,2)\nlines(x1,  x1 - 6); text(4,-3,3)\nlines(x1,  x1 + 6); text(-3,4,4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we do the same thing as in simple logistic regression and apply logistic function to each of those lines\n\n# Define sigmoid function\nsigmoid  = function(z) exp(z)/(1+exp(z))\n\n# Define hidden layer of our neural network\nfeatures = function(x1,x2) {\n  z1 =  6 + x1 + x2; a1 = sigmoid(z1)\n  z2 =  6 - x1 - x2; a2 = sigmoid(z2)\n  z3 =  6 - x1 + x2; a3 = sigmoid(z3)\n  z4 =  6 + x1 - x2; a4 = sigmoid(z4)\n  return(c(a1,a2,a3,a4))\n}\n\nUsing the matrix notation, we have \\[\nz = \\sigma(Wx + b), ~ W = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}, ~ b = \\begin{bmatrix} 6 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 6 \\end{bmatrix}, ~ \\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}\n\\]\nThe model shown above is the first layer of our neural network. It takes a two-dimensional input \\(x\\) and produces a four-dimensional output \\(z\\) which is called a feature vector. The feature vector is then passed to the output layer, which applies simple logistic regression to the feature vector. \\[\n\\hat{y} = \\sigma(w^Tz + b), ~ w = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}, ~ b = -3.1, ~ \\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}\n\\]\nThe output of the output layer is the probability of the positive class.\n\n# Calculate prediction (classification) using our neural network\npredict_prob = function(x){\n  x1 = x[1]; x2 = x[2]\n  z = features(x1,x2)\n  # print(z)\n  mu = sum(z) - 3.1\n  # print(mu)\n  sigmoid(mu)\n}\n\nWe can use our model to do the predictions now\n\n# Predict the probability of the positive class for a given point\npredict_prob(c(0,0))\n\n 0.71\n\npredict_prob(c(0,10))\n\n 0.26\n\n\nThe model generates sensible predictions, let’s plot the decision boundary to see how well it separates the data.\n\nx1 = seq(-11,11,length.out = 100)\nx2 = seq(-11,11,length.out = 100)\ngr = as.matrix(expand.grid(x1,x2));\n\n 10000     2\n\nyhat = apply(gr,1,predict_prob)\n\n 10000\n\nimage(x1,x2,matrix(yhat,ncol = 100), col = heat.colors(20,0.7))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow about a regression model? We will use a one-layer neural network to fit a quadratic function. We simulate noisy data from the following model \\[\ny = 0.5 + 0.3x^2 + \\epsilon, ~ \\epsilon \\sim N(0,0.02^2)\n\\] And use 3 hidden units in the first hidden layer and two units in the second hidden layer. The output layer is a single unit. We will use the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function for all layers. The model is defined as follows\n\nrelu = function(x) max(0,x)\nnn = function(W,f=relu) {\n    b0 = W[1]; w0=W[2:4];b1 = W[5]; w1 = W[6:8]\n    z0 = apply(b0 + outer(x,w0,'*'),1:2,f)\n    yhat = b1 + z0 %*% w1\n    return(list(yhat = yhat[,1],z0=z0))\n}\n\nThe hidden layer has three outputs (neurons) and uses the ReLU activation function. The output linear layer has a single output. Thus, the prediction yhat is generated as a linear model of the feature vector z0. The model has 8 parameters. Let’s generate training data and fit the model. We will use the BFGS optimization algorithm to minimize the loss function (negative log-likelihood) of the model.\n\nset.seed(99) #gretzky\nnl  = c(3,2)\nparams = c(0,rnorm(3),0,rnorm(3))\nx = seq(-1,1,0.02)\ny = 0.5 + 0.3*x^2 + rnorm(length(x),0,0.02)\nloss = function(W) sum((nn(W)$yhat - y)^2)\nres = optim(params, loss, method='BFGS')\nres$par\n\n -0.24  1.38 -0.83  0.46  0.50  0.18  0.46  0.38\n\n\nFigure 19.1 shows the quadratic function and the neural network model.

The hidden layers can have different activation functions.

The hyperbolic tangent function is defined as \\[\n\\tanh(z) = \\frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}}\n\\] Notice that the hyperbolic tangent function is a scaled version of the sigmoid function, with \\(\\tanh(0) = 0\\).

    "section": "19.4 Modern Deep Learning Architectures",
    "text": "19.4 Modern Deep Learning Architectures\nThe evolution of deep learning has led to increasingly sophisticated architectural patterns that go beyond simple stacked layers. Modern systems often combine multiple neural networks, reuse pre-trained components, and employ ensemble methods to achieve state-of-the-art performance. In this section, we explore three key architectural paradigms that have become central to contemporary deep learning practice: transfer learning with pre-trained blocks, mixture of experts models, and ensemble methods.\n\nTransfer Learning and Pre-trained Blocks\nOne of the most significant developments in deep learning is the recognition that neural networks learn hierarchical representations, where early layers capture general features and deeper layers encode task-specific patterns. This observation has given rise to transfer learning, where models trained on large-scale datasets can be adapted to new tasks with limited data.\nConsider the analogy of learning to drive different vehicles. Once you learn to drive a car, adapting to a truck requires learning the differences rather than starting from scratch. Similarly, a neural network trained to recognize objects in millions of images has learned fundamental visual features—edges, textures, shapes—that are useful for many computer vision tasks.\nThe typical transfer learning workflow involves taking a pre-trained model, removing its final layers, and replacing them with new layers appropriate for the target task. For example, a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on ImageNet [we discuss CNNs in detail in Chapter 23] can be adapted for medical image classification by freezing the early convolutional layers and retraining only the final classification layers. The mathematical formulation is straightforward. Let \\(F_{\\text{pre}}(X; \\theta_{\\text{frozen}})\\) represent the pre-trained feature extractor with frozen parameters, and \\(G(Z; \\theta_{\\text{new}})\\) the new task-specific layers. The complete model becomes:\n\\[\n\\hat{Y} = G(F_{\\text{pre}}(X; \\theta_{\\text{frozen}}); \\theta_{\\text{new}})\n\\]\nDuring training, we only optimize \\(\\theta_{\\text{new}}\\) while keeping \\(\\theta_{\\text{frozen}}\\) fixed. This approach has several advantages. First, it dramatically reduces the amount of labeled data required for the new task. Second, it decreases training time since we only update a subset of parameters. Third, it often leads to better generalization, especially when target task data is limited.\nModern frameworks make transfer learning remarkably accessible. In natural language processing, transformer-based models like BERT (Devlin et al. 2019) and GPT (Radford et al. 2018; Brown et al. 2020) are routinely fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering. These models, pre-trained on billions of tokens, capture rich linguistic representations that transfer across diverse language tasks [we explore transformers and language models in Chapters 24 and 25].\nThe practice of using pre-trained blocks extends beyond simple transfer learning. Modern architectures often incorporate multiple pre-trained components as building blocks. For instance, a system for visual question answering might combine a pre-trained CNN for image encoding with a pre-trained transformer for language understanding, with only a small fusion network trained from scratch.\n\n\nMixture of Experts\nAs models grow in scale and complexity, a natural question arises: must every parameter be active for every input? The mixture of experts (MoE) architecture provides an elegant answer by using different sub-networks (experts) for different inputs, with a gating mechanism that decides which experts to activate.\nThe core idea traces back to work by Jacobs et al. (1991), but has seen renewed interest in modern large-scale systems. Think of a medical diagnosis system where different specialists (cardiologist, neurologist, oncologist) examine patients based on their symptoms. A triage system routes each patient to the appropriate specialist. Similarly, in an MoE model, a gating network routes inputs to specialized expert networks.\nFormally, let \\(f_1, \\ldots, f_K\\) denote \\(K\\) expert models (networks), each implementing a function \\(f_k(X; \\theta_k)\\). A gating network \\(g(X; \\phi)\\) produces a probability distribution over experts, for example: \\[\ng(X; \\phi) = \\text{softmax}(W_g X + b_g) \\in \\mathbb{R}^K\n\\]\nThe final output is a weighted combination of expert predictions:\n\\[\n\\hat{Y}(X) = \\sum_{k=1}^K g_k(X; \\phi) \\cdot f_k(X; \\theta_k).\n\\]\nIn practice, to improve computational efficiency, only the top-\\(N\\) experts with highest gating scores are activated for each input, setting others to zero. This sparse activation pattern allows MoE models to have enormous capacity while maintaining reasonable computational costs.\nFrom a statistical perspective, Jiang and Tanner (1999a) provided important theoretical foundations for mixture of experts models. They demonstrated that hierarchical mixtures of experts (HME) can approximate arbitrary mean functions at a rate of \\(O(m^{-2/s})\\) in \\(L_p\\) norm, where \\(m\\) is the number of experts and \\(s\\) is the input dimensionality. This result establishes that MoE models are universal approximators with quantifiable convergence rates, connecting them to the broader statistical literature on nonparametric regression.\nThe work by Stroud, Müller, and Polson (2003) demonstrates an elegant application of mixture-of-experts principles within Bayesian inference for complex time series models. Their approach addresses the fundamental challenge of estimating hidden states in nonlinear state-space models where exact inference is mathematically intractable. The core innovation lies in using an auxiliary mixture model to approximate the intractable nonlinear components. This auxiliary model functions as a mixture of experts, where each expert is a simple linear regression model of the form \\(p^{a}(y_{t}|x_{t},z_{t}=k) = \\mathcal{N}(\\alpha_{k}+\\beta_{k}x_{t},\\tau_{k}^{2})\\). These linear experts provide local approximations of the true nonlinear function around specific “knots” in the state space. The gating mechanism employs state-dependent weights \\(\\pi_{k}(x_{t})\\) determined by Gaussian kernels centered at different locations. The current hidden state value \\(x_t\\) serves as input to this gating network, which determines the relevance of each linear expert for that particular region of the state space.\nA critical theoretical challenge with MoE models is identifiability: can the model parameters be uniquely determined from the data? Jiang and Tanner (1999b) showed that without constraints, MoE models suffer from inherent non-identifiability due to invariant transformations. For example, permuting expert labels or translating gating parameters can yield identical predictions. They established that by imposing order restrictions on expert parameters (such as requiring experts to be ordered by their intercepts) and proper initialization of gating parameters, MoE systems become identifiable. This work provides the statistical rigor necessary for reliable inference and interpretation of mixture of experts models, complementing the computational advances in modern implementations.\nRecent work has demonstrated the power of this approach at scale. Fedus, Zoph, and Shazeer (2022) trained a mixture of experts language model with 1.6 trillion parameters, where only a small fraction are active for any given input. The model achieves strong performance while requiring less computation per token than dense models of comparable quality. Similarly, Riquelme et al. (2021) showed that vision transformers with mixture of experts layers can achieve better accuracy-computation trade-offs than their dense counterparts.\nThe gating mechanism introduces an interesting learning problem: the network must simultaneously learn to specialize experts and to route inputs appropriately. Various training strategies have been proposed, including auxiliary losses that encourage load balancing across experts and techniques to promote expert specialization (Shazeer et al. 2017).\n\n\nEnsembles\nWhile mixture of experts learns a single integrated model with internal routing, ensemble methods combine predictions from multiple independently trained models. The rationale is straightforward: different models trained on the same data often make different errors, and averaging their predictions can reduce variance and improve overall performance.\nEnsemble methods have a long history in statistics and machine learning. The classical result from Dietterich (2000) shows that an ensemble is effective when individual models are accurate and diverse. Consider \\(M\\) models \\(f_1, \\ldots, f_M\\). For regression, a simple ensemble averages predictions:\n\\[\n\\hat{Y}_{\\text{ensemble}}(X) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{m=1}^M f_m(X)\n\\]\nFor classification, we can use majority voting or average the predicted probabilities. The bias-variance decomposition provides insight into why ensembles work. The expected squared error of a single model can be written as:\n\\[\n\\E{(Y - f(X))^2} = \\text{Bias}^2 + \\text{Variance} + \\text{Noise}\n\\]\nIf we average \\(M\\) models with the same bias but independent errors, the variance term reduces by a factor of \\(M\\), assuming the models are uncorrelated. In practice, models are not perfectly independent, but ensembles still typically achieve substantial variance reduction.\nIn deep learning, several ensemble strategies are commonly employed:\n\nModel averaging: Train multiple neural networks with different random initializations or architectures, then average their predictions at test time.\nSnapshot ensembles (Huang et al. 2017): Save model checkpoints at various points during training (particularly at local minima) and ensemble them.\nMulti-architecture ensembles: Combine models with different architectures (e.g., CNNs, transformers, and recurrent networks) to capture complementary patterns.\n\nA particularly effective technique is dropout as ensemble (Srivastava et al. 2014). During training, dropout randomly deactivates neurons with probability \\(p\\). At test time, all neurons are active but their outputs are scaled by \\((1-p)\\). Gal and Ghahramani (2016) showed that this can be interpreted as approximate Bayesian inference, where dropout at test time (called Monte Carlo dropout) produces an ensemble of sub-networks, providing both predictions and uncertainty estimates.\nThe computational cost of ensembles is their main drawback—inference requires running multiple models. However, the reliability gains are often worth the expense, particularly in high-stakes applications like medical diagnosis, autonomous driving, and financial forecasting. Modern competitions and benchmarks frequently use ensembles: winning solutions in Kaggle competitions typically combine dozens of models (Chen and Guestrin 2016).\n\n\nArchitectural Innovations\nThese three paradigms—pre-trained blocks, mixture of experts, and ensembles—represent different philosophies for building capable systems. Transfer learning emphasizes knowledge reuse, recognizing that representations learned on large datasets are broadly useful. Mixture of experts emphasizes conditional computation, activating only relevant capacity for each input. Ensembles emphasize diversity and robustness, combining multiple perspectives to improve reliability.\nModern systems often combine these approaches. For instance, a production system might ensemble multiple models, each of which uses pre-trained components and employs mixture of experts layers for efficiency. The field continues to develop new architectural patterns, but these fundamental ideas—reusing learned knowledge, routing computation dynamically, and aggregating diverse predictions—are likely to remain central to deep learning practice.\n\n\n\n\nBehnia, Farnaz, Dominik Karbowski, and Vadim Sokolov. 2021. “Deep Generative Models for Vehicle Speed Trajectories.” arXiv Preprint arXiv:2112.08361. https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08361.\n\n\nBhadra, Anindya, Jyotishka Datta, Nick Polson, Vadim Sokolov, and Jianeng Xu. 2021. “Merging Two Cultures: Deep and Statistical Learning.” arXiv Preprint arXiv:2110.11561. https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11561.\n\n\nBrown, Tom B., Benjamin Mann, Nick Ryder, Melanie Subbiah, Jared Kaplan, Prafulla Dhariwal, Arvind Neelakantan, et al. 2020. “Language Models Are Few-Shot Learners.” Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33: 1877–1901.\n\n\nChen, Tianqi, and Carlos Guestrin. 2016. “XGBoost: A Scalable Tree Boosting System.” In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 785–94.

    "text": "20.1 Ridge and Projection Pursuit Regression\nThis chapter explores the theoretical foundations of deep learning through the lens of multivariate function approximation, beginning with ridge functions as fundamental building blocks. Ridge functions, which take the form \\(f(x) = g(w^Tx)\\), represent one of the simplest forms of nonlinear multivariate functions by combining a single linear projection with a univariate nonlinear transformation. Their key geometric property—remaining constant along directions orthogonal to the projection vector \\(w\\)—makes them particularly useful for high-dimensional approximation. The chapter then introduces projection pursuit regression, which approximates complex input-output relationships using linear combinations of ridge functions, demonstrating how these mathematical constructs provide the groundwork for modern deep learning approaches.\nThe chapter culminates with the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem (KST), a profound result that shows any real-valued continuous function can be represented as a sum of compositions of single-variable functions. This theorem provides a theoretical framework for understanding how complex multivariate functions can be decomposed into simpler, more manageable components—a principle that underlies the architecture of modern neural networks. The discussion raises important questions about the trade-off between computational power and mathematical efficiency in machine learning, challenging whether superior performance can be achieved through mathematically elegant representations rather than brute-force computational approaches.\nTo understand the significance of this trade-off, we consider ridge functions, which represent a fundamental building block in multivariate analysis. Since our ultimate goal is to model arbitrary multivariate functions \\(f\\), we need a way to reduce dimensionality while preserving the ability to capture nonlinear relationships. Ridge functions accomplish this by representing one of the simplest forms of nonlinear multivariate functions, requiring only a single linear projection and a univariate nonlinear transformation. Formally, a ridge function \\(f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) takes the form \\(f(x) = g(w^Tx)\\), where \\(g\\) is a univariate function and \\(x,w \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\). The non-zero vector \\(w\\) is called the direction. The term “ridge” reflects a key geometric property: the function remains constant along any direction orthogonal to \\(w\\). Specifically, for any direction \\(u\\) such that \\(w^Tu = 0\\), we have\n\\[\nf(x+u) = g(w^T(x+u)) = g(w^Tx) = f(x)\n\\]\nThis structural simplicity makes ridge functions particularly useful as building blocks for high-dimensional approximation.\nRidge functions play a central role in high-dimensional statistical analysis. For example, projection pursuit regression approximates input-output relations using a linear combination of ridge functions Friedman and Stuetzle (1981),Huber (1985): \\[\n\\phi(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{p}g_i(w_i^Tx),\n\\] where both the directions \\(w_i\\) and functions \\(g_i\\) are variables and \\(w_i^Tx\\) are one-dimensional projections of the input vector. The vector \\(w_i^Tx\\) is a projection of the input vector \\(x\\) onto a one-dimensional space and \\(g_i(w_i^Tx)\\) can be thought of as a feature calculated from data. Diaconis and Shahshahani (1984) uses nonlinear functions of linear combinations, laying important groundwork for deep learning.\nThe landscape of modern machine learning has been shaped by the exponential growth in computational power, particularly through advances in GPU technology and frameworks like PyTorch. While Moore’s Law has continued to drive hardware improvements and CUDA algorithms have revolutionized our ability to process vast amounts of internet data, we pose the following question: can we achieve superior performance through mathematically efficient representations of multivariate functions rather than raw computational power?\nA fundamental challenge in machine learning lies in effectively handling high-dimensional input-output relationships. This challenge manifests itself in two distinct but related tasks. First, one task is to construct a “look-up” table (dictionary) for fast search and retrieval of input-output examples. This is an encoding and can be thought of as a data compression problem. Second, and perhaps more importantly, we must develop prediction rules that can generalize beyond these examples to handle arbitrary inputs.\nMore formally, we seek to find a good predictor function \\(f(x)\\) that maps an input \\(x\\) to its output prediction \\(y\\). In practice, the input \\(x\\) is typically a high-dimensional vector:\n\\[\ny = f ( x )  \\; \\; \\text{where} \\; \\; x =  ( x_1 , \\ldots , x_d )\n\\]\nGiven a training dataset \\((y_i,x_i)_{i=1}^N\\) of example input-output pairs, our goal is to train a model, i.e. to find the function \\(f\\). The key question is: how do we represent a multivariate function so as to obtain a desirable \\(f\\)?",

    "text": "20.2 Space Partitioning\nThe partitioning of the input space by a deep learner is similar to that performed by decision trees and partition-based models such as CART, MARS, RandomForests, BART. However, trees are more local in the regions that they use to construct their estimators within a region. Each neuron in a deep learning model corresponds to a manifold that divides the input space. In the case of the ReLU activation function \\(f(x) = \\max(0,x)\\), the manifold is simply a hyperplane and the neuron gets activated when the new observation is on the “right” side of this hyperplane, with the activation amount equal to how far from the boundary the given point is. For example in two dimensions, three neurons with ReLU activation functions will divide the space into seven regions, as shown on Figure 20.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.1\n\n\n\nThe key difference between tree-based architecture and neural network-based models is the way hyperplanes are combined. Figure 20.2 shows the comparison of space decomposition by hyperplanes as performed by a tree-based and neural network architectures.

The network architecture used is:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nY &=  \\mathrm{softmax}(w^0Z^2 + b^0)\\\\\nZ^2 &=  \\tanh(w^2Z^1 + b^2)\\\\\nZ^1 &=  \\tanh(w^1X + b^1)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe weight matrices for simple data are \\(W^1, W^2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}\\), for circle data \\(W^1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}\\) and \\(W^2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 2}\\), and for spiral data we have \\(W^1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}\\) and \\(W^2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4 \\times 2}\\). In our notation, we assume that the activation function is applied pointwise at each layer. An advantage of deep architectures is that the number of hyperplanes grows exponentially with the number of layers. The key property of an activation function (link) is \\(f(0) = 0\\) and it has zero value in certain regions. For example, hinge or rectified learner \\(\\max(x,0)\\), box car (differences in Heaviside) functions are very common. As compared to a logistic regression, rather than using logistic function, \\((1/(1+e^{-x}))\\) in deep learning \\(\\tanh\\) is typically used for training.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.2: Space partition by tree architectures (top row) and deep learning architectures (bottom row) for three different data sets.\n\n\n\nFormally, a Bayesian probabilistic approach (if computationally feasible) knows how to optimally weight predictors via a model averaging approach: \\[\n\\hat{Y}(X) = \\sum_{r=1}^R w_r \\hat{Y}_r(X)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{Y}_k(x) = E(Y \\mid X_k)\\). Such rules can achieve great out-of-sample performance. Amit, Blanchard, and Wilder (2000) discusses the striking success of multiple randomized classifiers. Using a simple set of binary local features, one classification tree can achieve 5% error on the NIST data base with 100,000 training data points. On the other hand, 100 trees, trained under one hour, when aggregated yield an error rate under 7%. We believe that this stems from the fact that a sample from a very rich and diverse set of classifiers produces on average weakly dependent classifiers conditional on class. A Bayesian model of weak dependence is exchangeability.",

    "text": "20.3 Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem (KST)\nKolmogorov demonstrated that any real-valued continuous function \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\) on \\(E^n\\) can be represented as a composition of single-variable functions:\n\\[\nf(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) = \\sum_{q=1}^{2n+1} g_q\\left(\\phi_q(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\(g_q\\) are continuous single-variable functions defined on \\(\\phi_q(E^n)\\). Kolmogorov further showed that the \\(\\phi_q\\) functions can be decomposed into sums of single-variable functions:\n\\[\n\\phi_q(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\psi_{q,i}(x_i)\n\\]\nThe Kolmogorov representation theorem Kolmogorov (1956) takes the form:\n\\[\nf(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) = \\sum_{q=1}^{2n+1} g_q\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\psi_{q,i}(x_i)\\right)\n\\]\nThe theorem has been refined over time, with inner functions becoming Hölder continuous and Lipschitz continuous, requiring modifications to both outer and inner functions.\nThe inner functions \\(\\psi_q\\) partition the input space into distinct regions, and the outer function, \\(g\\), must be constructed to provide the correct output values across the regions that the inner function defines. The outer function, \\(g\\), can be determined via a computationally intensive process of averaging. For each input configuration, the inner functions \\(\\Psi_q\\) generate a unique encoding, and \\(g\\) must map this encoding to the appropriate value of \\(f(x)\\). This creates a dictionary-like structure that associates each region with its corresponding output value. Koppen made significant contributions by correcting Sprecher’s original proof of this construction process, with improvements to the computational algorithm later suggested by Actor (2018) and Demb and Sprecher (2021). Braun further enhanced the understanding by providing precise definitions of the shift parameters \\(\\delta_k\\) and characterizing the topological structure induced by \\(\\Psi_q\\).\nA fundamental trade-off in KST exists between function smoothness and dimensionality. The inner functions \\(\\psi_{p,q}\\) can be chosen from two different function spaces, each offering distinct advantages. The first option is to use functions from \\(C^1([0,1])\\), but this limits the network’s ability to handle higher dimensions effectively. The second option is to relax the smoothness requirement to Holder continuous functions (\\(\\psi_{p,q} \\in \\text{Holder}_\\alpha([0,1])\\)), which satisfy the inequality \\(|\\psi(x) - \\psi(y)| &lt; |x-y|^\\alpha\\). These functions are less smooth, but this “roughness” enables better approximation in higher dimensions.\n\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks\nA significant development has been the emergence of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The key innovation of KANs is their use of learnable functions rather than weights on the network edges. This replaces traditional linear weights with univariate functions, typically parametrized by splines, enhancing both representational capacity and interpretability.\nThere is a practical connection between KST and neural networks by showing that any KAN can be constructed as a 3-layer MLP. Consider a KST in the form of sums of functions, a two layer model:\n\\[\nf( x_1 , \\ldots , x_d ) = f( x) = ( g \\circ \\psi ) (x )\n\\]\nThen KAN not only a superposition of functions but also a particular case of a tree of discrete Urysohn operators:\n\\[\nU(x_1 , \\ldots , x_d ) = \\sum_{j=1}^d g_j (x_j )\n\\]\nThis enables fast scalable algorithms avoiding backpropagation for any GAM model through projection descent with Newton-Kac(z)marz schemes.",

These features, determined by the Koppen function, provide universal topological information about the input space, effectively implementing a k-nearest neighbors structure that is inherent to the representation.\nThis leads to the following architecture. Any deep learner can be represented as a GAM with feature engineering (topological information) given by features \\(z_k\\) in the hidden layer:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\ny_i &= \\sum_{k=1}^{2n+1} g(z_k)\\\\\nz_k &= \\sum_{j=1}^n \\lambda^k\\psi(x_j + \\epsilon k) + k\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(\\psi\\) is a single activation function common to all nodes, and \\(g\\) is a single outer function.\nOne approach replaces each \\(\\phi_j\\) with a single ReLU network \\(g\\):\n\\[\ng(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^K \\beta_k\\text{ReLU}(w_kx + b_k)\n\\]\nwhere \\(K\\) is the number of neurons.\n\nKernel Smoothing: Interpolation\nThe theory of kernel methods was developed by Fredholm in the context of integral equations Fredholm (1903). The idea is to represent a function as a linear combination of basis functions, which are called kernels.\n\\[\nf(x) = \\int_{a}^{b} K(x,x')  d \\mu (x') dx'  \\; \\; \\text{where}\\; \\; x = ( x_1 , \\ldots , x_d )\n\\]\nHere, the unknown function \\(f(x)\\) is represented as a linear combination of kernels \\(K(x,x')\\) with unknown coefficients \\(\\phi(x')\\). The kernels are known, and the coefficients are unknown. The coefficients are found by solving the integral equation. The first work in this area was done by Abel who considered equations of the form above.\nNowadays, we call those equations Volterra integral equations of the first kind. Integral equations typically arise in inverse problems. Their significance extends beyond their historical origins, as kernel methods have become instrumental in addressing one of the fundamental challenges in modern mathematics: the curse of dimensionality.\nBartlett Nadaraya (1964) and Watson (1964) proposed the use of kernels to estimate the regression function. The idea is to estimate the regression function \\(f(x)\\) at point \\(x\\) by averaging the values of the response variable \\(y_i\\) at points \\(x_i\\) that are close to \\(x\\). The kernel is used to define the weights.\nThe regression function estimate:\n\\[\n\\hat{f}(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^n  y_i K(x,x_i)/ \\sum_{i=1}^n K(x,x_i) ,\n\\]\nwith normalized kernel weights.\nBoth Nadaraya and Watson considered the symmetric kernel \\(K(x,x') = K(\\|x'-x\\|_2)\\), where \\(||\\cdot||_2\\) is the Euclidean norm. The most popular kernel of that sort is the Gaussian kernel:\n\\[\nK(x,x') = \\exp\\left( -\\dfrac{\\|x-x'\\|_2^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right).\n\\]\nAlternatively, replacing the 2-norm with inner products: \\(K(x,x') = \\exp(x^Tx'/2\\sigma^2)\\).\nKernel methods are supported by numerous generalization bounds which often take the form of inequalities that describe the performance limits of kernel-based estimators. A particularly important example is the Bayes risk for \\(k\\)-nearest neighbors (\\(k\\)-NN), which can be expressed in a kernel framework as:\n\\[\n\\hat{f} ( x) =  \\sum_{i=1}^N w_i y_i        \\; \\text{where}\\; w_i := K( x_i , x ) /  \\sum_{i=1}^N K( x_i ,x )   \n\\]\n\\(k\\)-NN classifiers converge to error rates bounded relative to Bayes error rate, with relationships depending on class number. For binary classification, asymptotic \\(k\\)-NN error rate is at most \\(2R^*(1-R^*)\\) where \\(R^*\\) is Bayes error rate. Cover and Hart proved interpolated \\(k\\)-NN schemes are consistent estimators with performance improving as sample size increases.",

    "section": "20.5 Transformers as Kernel Smoothing",
    "text": "20.5 Transformers as Kernel Smoothing\nBahdanau, Cho, and Bengio (2014) proposed kernel smoothing for sequence-to-sequence learning, estimating next-word probability using context vectors—weighted averages of input sequence vectors \\(h_j\\):\n\\[\nc_i = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\alpha_{ij} h_j,\n\\]\nwhere weights \\(\\alpha_{ij}\\) are defined by the kernel function:\n\\[\n\\alpha_{ij} = \\dfrac{\\exp\\left( e_{ij}\\right)}{\\sum_{k=1}^n \\exp\\left( e_{ik}\\right)}.\n\\]\nInstead of using a traditional similarity measure like the 2-norm or inner product, the authors used a neural network to define the energy function \\(e_{ij} = a(s_{i-1},h_j)\\). This neural network measures the similarity between the last generated element of the output sequence \\(s_{i-1}\\) and \\(j\\)-th element of the input sequence \\(h_j\\). The resulting context vector is then used to predict the next word in the sequence.\n\nTransformer\nTransformers have since become a main building block for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks and has been extended to other domains as well due to their effectiveness. The transformer architecture is primarily designed to handle sequential data, making it well-suited for tasks such as machine translation, language modeling, text generation, and more. It achieves state-of-the-art performance by leveraging a novel attention mechanism.\nThe idea to use kernel smoothing for sequence to sequence was called “attention”, or cross-attention, by Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio (2014). When used for self-supervised learning, it is called self-attention. When a sequence is mapped to a matrix \\(M\\), it is called multi-head attention. The concept of self-attention and attention for natural language processing was further developed by Vaswani et al. (2023) who developed a smoothing method that they called the transformer.\nThe transformer architecture revolves around a series of mathematical concepts and operations:\n\nEmbeddings: The input text is converted into vectors using embeddings. Each word (or token) is represented by a unique vector in a high-dimensional space.\nPositional Encoding: Since transformers do not have a sense of sequence order (like RNNs do), positional encodings are added to the embeddings to provide information about the position of each word in the sequence.\nMulti-Head Attention: The core of the transformer model. It enables the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. The attention mechanism is defined as: \\[ \\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V \\] where \\(Q\\), \\(K\\), and \\(V\\) are query, key, and value matrices respectively.\nQuery (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) Vectors: These are derived from the input embeddings. They represent different aspects of the input.\nScaled Dot-Product Attention: The attention mechanism calculates the dot product of the Query with all Keys, scales these values, and then applies a softmax function to determine the weights of the Values.\nMultiple ‘Heads’: The model does this in parallel multiple times (multi-head), allowing it to capture different features from different representation subspaces.\nLayer Normalization and Residual Connections: After each sub-layer in the encoder and decoder (like multi-head attention or the feed-forward layers), the transformer applies layer normalization and adds the output of the sub-layer to its input (residual connection). This helps in stabilizing the training of deep networks.\nFeed-Forward Neural Networks: Each layer in the transformer contains a fully connected feed-forward network applied to each position separately and identically. It is defined as: \\[ \\text{FFN}(x) = \\max(0, xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2 \\] where \\(W_1\\), \\(W_2\\), \\(b_1\\), and \\(b_2\\) are learnable parameters.\nOutput Linear Layer and Softmax: The decoder’s final output passes through a linear layer followed by a softmax layer. This layer converts the decoder output into predicted next-token probabilities.\nTraining and Loss Function: Transformers are often trained using a variant of Cross-Entropy Loss to compare the predicted output with the actual output.\nMasking: In the decoder, to prevent future tokens from being used in the prediction, a technique called ‘masking’ is applied.\nBackpropagation and Optimization: The model’s parameters are adjusted through backpropagation and optimization algorithms like Adam.\n\nLater, Lin et al. (2017) proposed using similar idea for self-supervised learning, where a sequence of words (sentence) is mapped to a single matrix:\n\\[\nM = AH,\n\\]\nwhere \\(H\\) is the matrix representing an input sequence \\(H = (h_1,\\ldots,h_n)\\) and \\(A\\) is the matrix of weights:\n\\[\nA = \\mathrm{softmax}\\left(W_2\\tanh\\left(W_1H^T\\right)\\right).\n\\]\nThis allows to represent a sequence of words of any length \\(n\\) using a “fixed size” \\(r\\times u\\) matrix \\(M\\), where \\(u\\) is the dimension of a vector that represents an element of a sequence (word embedding) and \\(r\\) is the hyper-parameter that defines the size of the matrix \\(M\\).\nThe main advantage of using smoothing techniques (transformers) is that they are parallelizable. Current language models such as BERT, GPT, and T5 rely on this approach. Further, they also has been applied to computer vision and other domains. Its ability to capture long-range dependencies and its scalability have made it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications. See Tsai et al. (2019) for further details.",

    "text": "20.6 Application\n\nSimulated Data\nWe also apply the K-GAM architecture to a simulated dataset to evaluate its performance on data with known structure and relationships. The dataset contains 100 observations generated from the following function:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    &y = \\mu(x) + \\epsilon, \\quad \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\\\\n         &\\mu(x) = 10\\sin(\\pi x_1 x_2) + 20(x_3-0.5)^2 + 10x_4 + 5x_5.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe goal is to predict the function \\(y(x)\\) based on the input \\(x\\). The dataset is often used as a benchmark dataset for regression algorithms due to its diverse mix of relationships (linear, quadratic, nonlinear, Gaussian random noise) between the input features and the target function.\nWe use the Koppen function to transform the five-dimensional input into a set of 11 features (\\(2d+1\\)). We then learn the outer function \\(g\\) using a ReLU network. To thoroughly investigate the model’s capabilities, we implement two distinct approaches to learning the outer function. The first approach uses different \\(g\\) functions for each feature, following the original KST formulation. This allows each function to specialize in capturing specific patterns, but might be more difficult to train and has more parameters. The second approach uses a single \\(g\\) function for all features, as proposed by Lorentz (1976), providing a more unified and parameter-efficient representation.\nThe first model with multiple \\(g_i\\) functions has dimensions: \\(W^0_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{16\\times 1}\\) and \\(W^j_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{16\\times 16}\\) for \\(j=1,\\ldots,18\\).\nThe second architecture using single function \\(g\\) for all features maintains similar structure but increases inner layer width from 16 to 200. This increased capacity allows single functions to learn complex patterns, compensating for the constraint versus multiple specialized functions.\n\n\nTraining Rates\nConsider nonparametric regression \\(y_i= f (x_i) + \\epsilon_i\\) where \\(x_i = ( x_{1i} , \\ldots , x_{di} )\\). We estimate \\(f( x_1 , \\ldots , x_d )\\) for \\(x  = ( x_1 , \\ldots , x_d ) \\in [0,1]^d\\). From a classical risk perspective:\n\\[\nR ( f , \\hat{f}_N ) = E_{X,Y} \\left ( \\lVert  f - \\hat{f}_N \\rVert^2 \\right ),\n\\] where \\(\\lVert \\cdot \\rVert\\) denotes \\(L^2(P_X)\\)-norm.\nUnder standard assumptions, optimal minimax rate \\(\\inf_{\\hat{f}} \\sup_f R( f , \\hat{f}_N ) = O_p ( N^{- 2 \\beta /( 2 \\beta + d )} )\\) for \\(\\beta\\)-Holder smooth functions \\(f\\). This rate depends on dimension \\(d\\), problematic in high dimensions. Restricting function classes yields better rates independent of \\(d\\), avoiding the curse of dimensionality. Common approaches include linear superpositions (ridge functions) and projection pursuit models.\nAnother asymptotic result comes from posterior concentration. Here, \\(\\hat{f}_N\\) is a regularized MAP (maximum a posteriori) estimator solving:\n\\[\n\\hat{f}_N = \\arg \\min_{ \\hat{f}_N } \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N ( y_i - \\hat{f}_N ( x_i ))^2 + \\phi ( \\hat{f}_N )\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\phi(\\hat{f})\\) is regularization. Under appropriate conditions, posterior distribution \\(\\Pi(f | x, y)\\) concentrates around true function at minimax rate (up to \\(\\log N\\) factor).\nA key result in the deep learning literature provides convergence rates for deep neural networks. Given a training dataset of input-output pairs \\(( x_i , y_i)_{i=1}^N\\) from the model \\(y = f(x) + \\epsilon\\) where \\(f\\) is a deep learner (i.e. superposition of functions)\n\\[\nf = g_L \\circ \\ldots g_1 \\circ g_0\n\\]\nwhere each \\(g_i\\) is a \\(\\beta_i\\)-smooth Holder function with \\(d_i\\) variables, that is \\(| g_i (x) -g_i (y) &lt; | x-y |^\\beta\\).\nThen, the estimator has optimal rate:\n\\[\nO \\left ( \\max_{1\\leq i \\leq L } N^{- 2 \\beta^* /( 2 \\beta^* + d_i ) } \\right )  \\; \\text{where}\\; \\beta_i^* = \\beta_i \\prod_{l = i+1}^L \\min ( \\beta_l , 1 )\n\\]\nThis result can be applied to various function classes, including generalized additive models of the form\n\\[\nf_0 ( x ) = h \\left ( \\sum_{p=1}^d f_{0,p} (x_p) \\right )\n\\]\nwhere \\(g_0(z) = h(z)\\), \\(g_1 ( x_1 , \\ldots , x_d ) = ( f_{01}(x_1) , \\ldots , f_{0d} (x_d) )\\) and \\(g_2 ( y_1 , \\ldots , y_d ) = \\sum_{i=1}^d y_i\\). In this case, \\(d_1 = d_2 = 1\\), and assuming \\(h\\) is Lipschitz, we get an optimal rate of \\(O(N^{-1/3})\\), which is independent of \\(d\\).\nSchmidt-Hieber (2021) show that deep ReLU networks also have optimal rate of \\(O( N^{-1/3} )\\) for certain function classes. For \\(3\\)-times differentiable (e.g. cubic B-splines ), Coppejans (2004) finds a rate of \\(O( N^{-3/7} ) = O( N^{-3/(2 \\times 3 + 1) } )\\). Igelnik and Parikh (2003) finds a rate \\(O( N^{-1} )\\) for Kolmogorov Spline Networks.\nFinally, it’s worth noting the relationship between expected risk and empirical risk. The expected risk, \\(R\\), is typically bounded by the empirical risk plus a term of order \\(1/\\sqrt{N}\\):\n\\[\nR(y, f^\\star) \\leq \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N R(y_i, f^\\star(x_i)) + O\\left(\\frac{\\|f\\|}{\\sqrt{N}}\\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\(f^\\star\\) is the minimizer of the expected risk. However, in the case of interpolation, where the model perfectly fits the training data, the empirical risk term becomes zero, leaving only the \\(O(1/\\sqrt{N})\\) term.",

Even though it is well known that deep learners are universal approximators, it is still an open area of research to understand why deep learners generalize well on out-of-sample predictions.

However, a fully Bayesian approach is often computationally prohibitive in high-dimensional feature space, without resorting to approximations or foregoing UQ. The alternative approach is to perform a data transformation or reduction on the data input \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), such as performing a PCA or PCR first and then use a statistical approach on the transformed feature space. Deep learning methods can fit into this spectrum by viewing it as a non-linear PCA or PLS N. Polson, Sokolov, and Xu (2021),Malthouse, Mah, and Tamhane (1997).

    "text": "20.8 Deep Learning Expansions\nSimilar to a tree model that finds features (aka tree leaves) via recursive space partitioning, the deep learning model finds the regions by using hyperplanes at the first layer and combinations of hyperplanes in the further layers. The prediction rule is embedded into a parameterized deep learner, a composite of univariate semi-affine functions, denoted by \\(F_{\\mathbf{W}}\\) where \\(\\mathbf{W} = [\\mathbf{W}^{(1)}, \\ldots , \\mathbf{W}^{(L)}]\\) represents the weights of each layer of the network. A deep learner takes the form of a composition of link functions:\n\\[\nF_{\\mathbf{W}} = f_L \\circ f_{L-1} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_1  \\; \\text{where}\\; f_L = \\sigma_L ( \\mathbf{W}_L \\phi (\\mathbf{X}) + \\mathbf{b}_L),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\sigma_L(\\cdot)\\) is a univariate link or activation function. Specifically, let \\(\\mathbf{Z}^{(l)}\\) denote the \\(l^{th}\\) layer, and so \\(\\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{Z}^{(0)}\\). The final output is the response \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\), which can be numeric or categorical. A deep prediction rule is then \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}(\\mathbf{X}) = \\mathbf{W}^{(L)} \\mathbf{Z}^{(L)} + \\mathbf{b}^{(L)}\\) where\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{Z}^{(L)} & = f^{(L)} \\left ( \\mathbf{W}^{(L-1)} \\mathbf{Z}^{(L-1)} + \\mathbf{b}^{(L-1)} \\right ),\\\\\n& \\ldots\\\\\n\\mathbf{Z}^{(2)} & = f^{(2)} \\left ( \\mathbf{W}^{(1)} \\mathbf{Z}^{(1)} + \\mathbf{b}^{(1)} \\right ),\\\\\n\\mathbf{Z}^{(1)} & = f^{(1)} \\left (\\mathbf{W}^{(0)} \\phi(\\mathbf{X}) + \\mathbf{b}^{(0)} \\right ).\n\\end{align*}\\]\nIt is often beneficial to replace the original input \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) with the features \\(\\mathbf{Z} = \\phi(\\mathbf{X})\\) of lower dimensionality when developing a predictive model for \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\). For example, in the context of regressions, a lower variance prediction rule can be obtained in lower dimensional space. DL simply uses a composition or superposition of semi-affine filters (aka link functions), leading to a new framework for high-dimensional modeling in Section @ref(sec:merging).\nDeep learning can then be viewed as a feature engineering solution and one of finding nonlinear factors via supervised dimension reduction. A composition of hand-coded characteristics i.e. dimension expanding, with supervised learning of data filters i.e. dimension reduction. Advances in computation allow for massive data and gradients of high-dimensional nonlinear filters. Neural networks can be viewed from two perspectives: either as a flexible link function, as in a generalized linear model, or as a method to achieve dimensionality reduction, similar to sliced inverse regression or sufficient dimensionality reduction.\nOne advantage of depth is that the hierarchical mixture allows the width of a given layer to be manageable. With a single layer (e.g., kernel PCA/SVM) we need exponentially many more basis functions in that layer. Consider kernel PCA with say radial basis functions (RBF) kernels: technically there are infinitely many basis functions, but it cannot handle that many input dimensions. Presumably, a deep neural network allows a richer class of covariances that allows anisotropy and non-stationarity. In the end, this is reflected in the function realizations from a DNN. To see this, consider the deep GP models, which are infinite width limits of DNNs. There is a recursive formula connecting the covariance of layer \\(k\\) to that of layer \\(k+1\\), but no closed form. The covariance function of the final hidden layer is probably very complicated and capable of expressing an arbitrary number of features, even if the covariances in each layer may be simple. The increase in dimensionality happens through the hierarchical mixture, rather than trying to do it all in one layer. From a statistical viewpoint, this is similar to the linear shallow wide projections introduced by Wold (1975/ed) and the sufficient dimension reduction framework of Cook (2007).\nIn the context of unsupervised learning, information in the marginal distribution, \\(p(\\mathbf{X})\\), of the input space is used as opposed to the conditional distribution, \\(p(\\mathbf{X}\\mid \\mathbf{Y})\\). Methods such as PCA (PCA), PCR (PCR), Reduced Rank Regression (RRR), Projection-Pursuit Regression (PPR) all fall into this category and PLS (PLS), Sliced Inverse Regression (SIR) are examples of supervised learning of features, see N. G. Polson, Sokolov, et al. (2017) for further discussion.\nWe first uncover the structure in the predictors relevant for modeling the output \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\). The learned factors are denoted by \\(F(\\phi(\\mathbf{X}))\\) and are constructed as a sequence of input filters. The predictive model is given by a probabilistic model of the form \\(p(\\mathbf{Y} \\mid \\mathbf{X}) \\equiv p(\\mathbf{Y} \\mid F(\\phi(\\mathbf{X})))\\). Here \\(\\phi: \\mathbb{R}^p \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^c,~c \\gg p\\) initially expands the dimension of the input space by including terms such as interactions, dummy variables (aka one-hot encodings) and other nonlinear features of the input space deemed relevant. Then, \\(F\\) reduces dimension of deep learning by projecting back with a univariate activation function into an affine space (aka regression). This framework also sheds light on how to build deep (skinny) architectures. Given \\(n\\) data points, we split into \\(L = 2^p\\) regions so that there is a fixed sample size within each bin. This process transforms \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) into many interpretable characteristics. This can lead to a huge number of predictors that can be easily dealt within the DL architecture, making the advantage of depth clear.",

    "section": "20.9 Dimensionality Expansion",
    "text": "20.9 Dimensionality Expansion\nFirst, we review ‘dimensionality expansions’: data transformation that transforms an input vector \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) into a higher dimensional vector \\(\\phi(\\mathbf{X})\\). One approach is to use hand-coded predictors. This expanded set can include terms such as interactions, dummy variables or nonlinear functional of the original predictors. The goal is to model the joint distribution of outputs and inputs, namely \\(p(\\mathbf{Y} , \\phi(\\mathbf{x}))\\), where we allow our stochastic predictors.\nKernel Expansion: The kernel expansion idea is to enlarge the feature space via basis expansion. The basis is expanded using nonlinear transformations of the original inputs: \\[\\phi(\\mathbf{X}) = (\\phi_1(\\mathbf{X}),\\phi_2(\\mathbf{X}),\\ldots,\\phi_M(\\mathbf{X}))\\] so that linear regression \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} = \\phi(\\mathbf{X})^T\\beta + \\beta_0\\) or generalized linear model can be used to model the input-output relations. Here, the ‘kernel trick’ increases dimensionality, and allows hyperplane separation while avoiding an exponential increase in the computational complexity. The transformation \\(\\phi(\\mathbf{x})\\) is specified via a kernel function \\(K(\\cdot, \\cdot)\\) which calculates the dot product of feature mappings: \\(K(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}') = \\phi(\\mathbf{x})^T\\phi(\\mathbf{x}').\\) By choosing a feature map \\(\\phi\\), we implicitly choose a kernel function and, conversely, every positive semi-definite kernel matrix corresponds to a feature mapping \\(\\phi\\). For example, when \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\), choosing \\(K(\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{X}') = (1+\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}')^2\\) is equivalent to expanding the basis to \\(\\phi(\\mathbf{X}) = (1,\\sqrt{2}\\mathbf{X}_1, \\sqrt{2}\\mathbf{X}_1, \\mathbf{X}_1^2,\\mathbf{X}_2^2,\\sqrt{2}\\mathbf{X}_1 \\mathbf{X}_2)\\).\nTree Expansion: Similar to kernels, we can think of trees as a technique for expanding a feature space. Each region in the input space defined by a terminating node of a tree corresponds to a new feature. Then, the predictive rule becomes very simple: identify in which region the new input is and use the average across observations or a majority voting rule from this region to calculate the prediction.",

    "text": "20.10 Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, PCR and PLS\nGiven input/predictors \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and response \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) and associated observed data \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in {\\mathbb{R}}^{n \\times p}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Y} \\in {\\mathbb{R}}^{n\\times q}\\), the goal is to find data transformations \\((\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{X}) \\mapsto \\phi(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{X})\\) so that modeling the transformed data becomes an easier task. In this paper, we consider several types of transformations and model non-linear relations.\nWe start by reviewing the widely used singular value decomposition (SVD) which allows finding linear transformations to identify a lower dimensional representation of either \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), by what is known as principal component analysis (PCA), or, when using both \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\), known as partial least squares (PLS). First, start with the SVD decomposition of the input matrix: \\(\\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{U} \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{W}^T\\), which is full-rank if \\(n &gt; p\\). Here, \\(\\mathbf{D} = \\mathrm{diag} (d_1 , \\ldots , d_p )\\) are the nonzero ordered singular values (\\(d_1 \\ge \\ldots \\ge d_p)\\) . The matrices \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) are orthogonal matrices of dimensions \\(n\\times p\\) and \\(p \\times p\\) with columns of \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) as the right singular vectors and columns of \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) as the left singular vectors, \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) can be also thought of as the matrix consisting of eigenvectors for \\(\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X}\\). We can then transform the original first layer to an orthogonal regression, namely defining \\(\\mathbf{Z} = \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{D}\\) whose columns are the principal components. For PCR, using \\(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = \\mathbf{W}^T \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\), we arrive at the corresponding OLS estimator \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}} = (\\mathbf{Z}^T \\mathbf{Z} )^{-1} \\mathbf{Z}^T \\mathbf{Y} = \\mathbf{D}^{-1} \\mathbf{U}^T \\mathbf{y}\\), and obtain \\(\\hat{y}_{pcr} = \\sum_{j=1}^{K}\\hat{\\alpha}_j \\mathbf{z}_j\\), where \\(\\hat{\\alpha}_j = \\mathbf{z}_j^T \\mathbf{y}/\\mathbf{z}_j^T \\mathbf{z}_j\\), since \\(\\mathbf{z}_j\\)’s are orthogonal, and \\(K \\ll p\\) denotes the reduced dimension that captures a certain percentage of the total variability.\nPCR, as an unsupervised approach to dimension reduction, has a long history in statistics. Specifically, we first center and standardize \\((\\mathbf{Y}, \\mathbf{X})\\), followed by a singular value decomposition of \\(\\mathbf{V}: = \\mathrm{ave} ( \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{X}^T )  = \\dfrac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mathbf{X}_i\\mathbf{X}_i^T\\) where \\(\\mathrm{ave}(\\cdot)\\) denotes the empirical average. Then, we find the eigenvalues \\(e_j^2\\) and eigenvectors arranged in non-increasing order, so we can write:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{V} = \\sum_{j=1}^p  e_j^2 {\\mathbf{v}}_j {\\mathbf{v}}_k^T .\n\\]\nThis leads to a sequence of regression models \\((\\hat Y_0, \\ldots, \\hat Y_K)\\) with \\(\\hat Y_0\\) being the overall mean:\n\\[\n\\hat{Y}_L = \\sum_{l=0}^K (\\mathrm{ave} ( \\mathbf{W}_l^T \\mathbf{X} ) / e_l^2 ) \\mathbf{v}_l^T \\mathbf{X}.\n\\]\nTherefore, PCR finds features \\(\\{\\mathbf{Z}_k\\}_{k=0}^K = \\{\\mathbf{v}_k^T \\mathbf{x}\\}_{k=0}^K = \\{\\mathbf{f}_k \\}_{k=0}^K\\).\nPLS and SVD Algorithm: Partial least squares, or PLS, is a related dimension reduction technique similar to PCR that first identifies a lower-dimensional set of features and then fits a linear model on this feature set, but PLS does this in a supervised fashion unlike PCR. In successive steps, PLS finds a reduced dimensional representation of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) that is relevant for the response \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\).\nPCA and multivariate output: PCA requires us to compute a reduction of multivariate output \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) using a singular value decomposition of \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) by finding eigenvectors of \\(\\mathbf{Z} = \\mathrm{ave}(\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{Y}^T)\\). Then, the output is a linear combination of the singular vectors\n\\[\n\\mathbf{Y} = \\mathbf{W}_1 \\mathbf{Z}_1 + \\cdots + \\mathbf{W}_k \\mathbf{Z}_k,\n\\]\nwhere the weights \\(\\mathbf{W}_i\\) follow a Gaussian Process, \\(\\mathbf{W}\\sim \\mathrm{GP}(m,K)\\). Hence, the method can be highly non-linear. This method is typically used when input variables come from a designed experiment. If the interpretability of factors is not important, and from a purely predictive point of view, PLS will lead to improved performance.\nIn the light of the above, one can view deep learning models as non-stochastic hierarchical data transformations. The advantage is that we can learn deterministic data transformations before applying a stochastic model. This allows us to establish a connection between a result due to Brillinger (2012) and the use of deep learning models to develop a unified framework for modeling complex high-dimensional data sets. The prediction rule can be viewed as interpolation. In high-dimensional spaces, one can mix-and-match the deterministic and stochastic data transformation rules.",

Even though Brillinger (2012) assumes that input \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is Gaussian in order to apply Stein’s lemma, this result generalizes to scale-mixtures of Gaussians. See also Iwata (2001) who provides analytical derivation of the uncertainty intervals for ReLU and Probit nonlinear activation functions.\nThe key insight here is that the lion’s share of the UQ can be done at the top layer that outputs \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) as the uncertainty in the dimension reduction of the \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) space is much harder to quantify compared to quantifying the uncertainty for the prediction rule.

Furthermore, a result of Iwata (2001) can be used to show that the posterior distribution is asymptotically normal. Hence, we can calculate the expectations analytically for activation functions, such as ReLU. As ReLU is convex, Jensen’s inequality \\(g\\left(\\mathrm{E}(\\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{X})\\right) \\le \\mathrm{E}\\left(g(\\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{X})\\right)\\) shows that ignoring parameter uncertainty leads to under-prediction.",

    "section": "20.12 Double Descent",
    "text": "20.12 Double Descent\nDouble descent is a phenomenon of over-parameterized statistical models. In this section, we present a view of double descent from a Bayesian perspective. Over-parameterized models such as deep neural networks have an interesting re-descending property in their risk characteristics. This is a recent phenomenon in machine learning and has been the subject of many studies. As the complexity of the model increases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional bias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number of observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become infinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends—the double descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation. Moreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam’s razor that Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when possible.\nEmpirically, the double descent effect was initially observed for high-dimensional neural network regression models and the good performance of these models on such tasks as large language models, image processing, and generative AI methods(Nareklishvili, Polson, and Sokolov 2023). The double descent effect extends the classical bias-variance trade-off curve that shrinkage estimators possess. This phenomenon was first observed in the context of linear regression(Belkin et al. 2019). The authors showed that the test error of the estimator can decrease as the number of parameters increases. Bach (2024) extends these results to stochastic regression models.\nInterpolators—estimators that achieve zero training error—were then shown to have attractive properties due to the double descent effect(Hastie et al. 2022). Our goal is to show that Bayesian estimators can also possess a double descent phenomenon. Interpolators such as ReLU neural networks(N. G. Polson, Sokolov, et al. 2017) have increased in popularity with many applications such as traffic flow modeling(N. G. Polson, Sokolov, et al. 2017) and high-frequency trading(Dixon, Polson, and Sokolov 2019), among many others.\nOccam’s razor—the favoring of simpler models over complex ones—is a natural feature of Bayesian methods that are based on the weight of evidence (a.k.a. the marginal likelihood of the data). To do this, they penalize models with higher complexity via a correction term as in the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This seems inconsistent with the double descent phenomenon. We show that this is not the case, as even though Bayesian methods shift the posterior towards lower-complexity models, highly parameterized Bayesian models can also have good risk properties due to the conditional prior of parameters given the model. We illustrate this with an application to neural network models.\nDouble descent has been studied from a frequentist point of view in Belkin et al. (2019), Bach (2024). The phenomenon of double descent is illustrated in Figure 20.3. The first part of the curve represents the classical U-shaped bias-variance trade-off. The second part demonstrates the double descent phenomenon, where the test error of the estimator can decrease as the model becomes over-parameterized beyond the interpolation threshold. This phenomenon was later observed in the context of deep learning(Nakkiran et al. 2021). The authors showed that the test error of the estimator can decrease as the number of parameters increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.3\n\n\n\n\nExample 20.1 (Double Descent Demonstration using Polynomial Regression) To illustrate the double descent phenomenon in a concrete setting, we present a detailed example using polynomial regression with Legendre basis functions. This example demonstrates how the test error can exhibit the characteristic U-shaped curve followed by a re-descent as model complexity increases far beyond the interpolation threshold.\nOur demonstration uses a one-dimensional regression problem where we attempt to learn a sinusoidal function \\(f(x) = \\sin(5x)\\) from a small dataset of only \\(n = 20\\) observations sampled from the interval \\([-1, 1]\\). We add Gaussian noise with standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 0.3\\) to simulate realistic measurement error. The choice of a small sample size is crucial for observing double descent, as it creates a regime where the number of model parameters can substantially exceed the number of observations.\nWe fit polynomial models of varying degrees \\(d = 1, 2, \\ldots, 50\\) using Legendre polynomial basis functions. Legendre polynomials provide a numerically stable orthogonal basis that helps avoid the numerical instabilities associated with standard monomial bases in high-degree polynomial fitting. For each degree \\(d\\), we estimate the coefficients using the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse, which provides the minimum-norm solution when the system is overdetermined (i.e., when \\(d &gt; n\\)).\nFigure 20.4 illustrates how model behavior changes dramatically across different polynomial degrees. The four panels show representative cases that capture the key phases of the double descent phenomenon:\n\nDegree 1 (Underparameterized): The linear model is too simple to capture the oscillatory nature of the underlying sine function, resulting in high bias and poor fit to both training and test data.\nDegree 5 (Classical Optimum): This represents the sweet spot of the classical bias-variance tradeoff, where the model has sufficient complexity to capture the main features of the sine function without overfitting severely.\nDegree 20 (Interpolation Threshold): At this degree, the model has exactly as many parameters as training observations, enabling perfect interpolation of the training data. However, the resulting fit exhibits wild oscillations between data points, leading to poor generalization performance.\nDegree 50 (Over-parameterized): Surprisingly, despite having far more parameters than observations, this highly over-parameterized model achieves better test performance than the interpolating model, demonstrating the double descent effect.\n\n\n\nCode\nn = 20  # number of samples\nsigma = 0.3  # stdev of noise\na = -1\nb = 1  # range of x values\n# Use Legendre polynomial basis by default\nG = np.polynomial.legendre.legvander\n\ndef poly(pts, beta, d):\n    return G(pts, d).dot(beta)\n\n# Initialize data\nground_truth = sin\nx = np.linspace(a, b, n)\ny = ground_truth(x) + sigma * np.random.normal(size=n)\nxdense = np.linspace(a, b, 100)\nygt = ground_truth(xdense)\n\n# Core functions\ndef solve_reg(A, y, lamb):\n    return la.solve(A.T.dot(A) + lamb * np.identity(A.shape[1]), A.T.dot(y))\n\ndef fit(d):\n    betaHat = la.pinv(G(x, d)).dot(y)\n    mseos = np.sqrt(np.mean((G(xdense, d).dot(betaHat) - ygt)**2))\n    mseis = np.sqrt(np.mean((G(x, d).dot(betaHat) - y)**2))\n    return betaHat, mseos, mseis\n\ndef run(d, ax):\n    \"\"\"Compute the regressor for degree d, and plot the solution.\"\"\"\n    betaHat, mseos, mseois = fit(d)\n    ax.plot(xdense, ygt, label='ground-truth')\n    ax.scatter(x, y, c='r', label='samples')\n    ax.plot(xdense, poly(xdense, betaHat, d), label='model')\n    ax.set_ylim(-2, 2)\n    ax.axis('off')\n    ax.legend()\n    ax.set_title('d=%d, MSE: Test=%.2f, Train=%.2f' % (d, mseos, mseois))\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create 2x2 subplot grid (all functions and variables are now persistent!)\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 10))\nfig.suptitle('Double Descent Phenomenon: Polynomial Regression', fontsize=16)\n\n# Plot each degree in its respective subplot\nrun(1, axes[0, 0])   # Top left\nrun(5, axes[0, 1])   # Top right  \nrun(20, axes[1, 0])  # Bottom left\nrun(50, axes[1, 1])  # Bottom right\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.4: Double Descent Phenomenon: Polynomial Regression with Different Degrees\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s plot the MSE curve.

The curve exhibits three distinct phases:\n\nClassical Regime: For low degrees (\\(d &lt; 5\\)), increasing model complexity reduces both bias and test error, following the traditional understanding of the bias-variance tradeoff.\nInterpolation Crisis: Around the interpolation threshold (\\(d \\approx n = 20\\)), test error peaks dramatically as the model begins to perfectly fit the training data while generalizing poorly.\nOver-parameterized Regime: For very high degrees (\\(d &gt; 30\\)), test error decreases again, demonstrating that extreme over-parameterization can lead to improved generalization despite the model’s ability to memorize the training data.\n\nThis behavior challenges the conventional wisdom that more parameters necessarily lead to worse generalization. The double descent phenomenon arises from the implicit regularization effects of minimum-norm solutions in over-parameterized settings. When \\(d &gt; n\\), the pseudoinverse solution corresponds to the minimum \\(\\ell_2\\)-norm coefficients among all possible interpolating solutions. This implicit bias toward simpler functions can lead to surprisingly good generalization properties.\nWhile this example uses polynomial regression for clarity, the double descent phenomenon has been observed across a wide range of modern machine learning models, including deep neural networks, random forests, and kernel methods. The implications for practice are significant. Given that model selection is time consuming and computationally expensive, this example shows, that instead of spending time to do model selection to find the “sweet spot” model with 5-degree polynomial, we just over-parametrise and get a good model for free!\nThis example serves as a concrete illustration of how classical statistical intuitions about model complexity may not apply in contemporary machine learning settings, particularly when dealing with over-parameterized models that have become increasingly common in practice.\n\n\n\n\n\nActor, Jonas. 2018. “Computation for the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem.” {{MS Thesis}}, Rice.\n\n\nAmit, Yali, Gilles Blanchard, and Kenneth Wilder. 2000. “Multiple Randomized Classifiers: MRCL.”\n\n\nBach, Francis. 2024. “High-Dimensional Analysis of Double Descent for Linear Regression with Random Projections.” SIAM Journal on Mathematics of Data Science 6 (1): 26–50.\n\n\nBahdanau, Dzmitry, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014. “Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate.” arXiv. https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473.\n\n\nBelkin, Mikhail, Daniel Hsu, Siyuan Ma, and Soumik Mandal. 2019. “Reconciling Modern Machine-Learning Practice and the Classical Bias–Variance Trade-Off.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 116 (32): 15849–54.\n\n\nBrillinger, David R. 2012. “A Generalized Linear Model With ‘Gaussian’ Regressor Variables.” In Selected Works of David Brillinger, edited by Peter Guttorp and David Brillinger, 589–606.

    "text": "21.1 Deep Learning and Least Squares\nTraditional statistical models are estimated by maximizing likelihood and using the least squares algorithm for linear regression and weighted least squares or Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm for generalized linear models.\nHowever, second-order optimization algorithms do not work well for deep learning models. The reason is that the number of parameters a DL model has is large and estimating second-order derivatives (Hessian or Fisher information matrix) becomes prohibitive from both computational and memory use standpoints. Instead, first-order gradient descent methods are used for estimating parameters of deep learning models.\nGiven a parametric model \\(f_{\\theta}(x)\\), the problem of parameter estimation (when likelihood belongs to the exponential family) is an optimization problem: \\[\n    \\min_{\\theta} l(\\theta) := -\\dfrac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log p(y_i, f_{\\theta}(x_i)),\n\\] where \\(l\\) is the negative log-likelihood of a sample, and \\(\\theta\\) is the vector of parameters. The gradient descent method is an iterative algorithm that starts with an initial guess \\(\\theta^{0}\\) and then updates the parameter vector \\(\\theta\\) at each iteration \\(t\\) as follows: \\[\n    \\theta^{t+1} = \\theta^t - \\alpha_t \\nabla l(\\theta^t).\n\\] Here \\[\n\\nabla l(\\theta^t) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial \\theta_0}, \\ldots,\\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial \\theta_p}\\right),\n\\] is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters at iteration \\(t\\).\nThis algorithm is based on the simple fact that a function value decreases in the direction of the negative gradient, at least locally. This fact follows from the definition of the gradient, which is the vector of partial derivatives of the function with respect to its parameters. The gradient points in the direction of the steepest ascent, and thus the negative gradient points in the direction of the steepest descent. It is easy to see in the figure below, where the function \\(l(x)\\) is shown in blue and the gradient at the point \\(x_0\\) is shown in red. The negative gradient points in the direction of the steepest descent, which is the direction we want to go to minimize the function. We can easily see it in a one-dimensional case. The derivative is defined as \\[\n    l'(\\theta) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{l(\\theta+h) - l(\\theta)}{h}.\n\\] The derivative is the slope of the tangent line to the function at the point \\(\\theta\\). The derivative is positive, when \\(l(\\theta+h) &gt; l(\\theta)\\) for small \\(h &gt; 0\\), then the function is increasing at that point, and if it is negative, then the function is decreasing at that point. Thus, we can use the negative derivative to find the direction of the steepest descent.\nFor the derivative (or gradient in the multivariate case) to be defined, the function \\(l(\\theta)\\) must be continuous and “smooth” at the point \\(\\theta\\). In practice, this means that the function must not have any “sharp” corners or discontinuities at the point \\(\\theta\\). For example, \\(f(\\theta) = |\\theta|\\) has a “sharp corner” at zero, and a derivative of \\(1\\) for \\(\\theta &gt; 0\\) and \\(-1\\) for \\(\\theta &lt; 0\\). The fact that the derivative is not defined at zero means that the function is not “smooth” at that point, resulting in an undefined derivative. This is called a non-differentiable point. Another example of a non-differentiable point is the point of discontinuity, where the function is not defined at that point. For example, the function \\(f(\\theta) = \\text{sign}(\\theta)\\) is not defined at \\(x=0\\), and so is its derivative.\nWe will use the gradient descent algorithm to estimate parameters of deep neural networks later in this book. Although the problem of estimating parameters of a deep neural network leads to optimizing a non-smooth function (the likelihood function is not smooth due to the ReLU activation function), the gradient descent algorithm still works well in practice. We will discuss the reasons for this in the next section.\nThe second component of the gradient descent algorithm is the learning rate \\(\\alpha_t\\), which is a positive scalar that controls the step size of the update (a.k.a. learning rate). The learning rate is a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned for each problem. If the learning rate is too small, the algorithm will converge slowly, and if it is too large, the algorithm may diverge or oscillate around the minimum. The Figure 21.1 below shows the effect of different learning rates on the convergence of the gradient descent algorithm. The blue line is the function \\(l(\\theta)\\), the red arrows are the updates of the parameter from \\(\\theta_0 = 2\\). When \\(\\alpha = 0.5\\) (just right), the algorithm converges to the minimum in one step, when \\(\\alpha = 0.25\\), it takes two steps, and when \\(\\alpha = 1\\), it “overshoots” the minimum and goes to the other side of the function, which is not desirable.\nIn practice, the learning rate is often set to a small value, such as \\(0.01\\) or \\(0.001\\), and then adjusted during the training process. There are several techniques for adjusting the learning rate, such as learning rate decay, where the learning rate is reduced by a factor at each epoch, or adaptive learning rates, where the learning rate is adjusted based on the gradient of the loss function.\nThe deep learning model approximates the relation between inputs \\(x\\) and outputs \\(y\\) using a non-linear function \\(f_{\\theta}(x)\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is a vector of parameters. The goal is to find the optimal value of \\(\\theta\\) that minimizes the negative log-likelihood (loss function), given a training data set \\(D = \\{x_i,y_i\\}_{i=1}^n\\). The loss function is a measure of discrepancy between the true value of \\(y\\) and the predicted value \\(f_{\\theta}(x)\\) \\[\n    l(\\theta) = - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log p(y_i | x_i, \\theta),\n\\] where \\(p(y_i | x_i, \\theta)\\) is the conditional likelihood of \\(y_i\\) given \\(x_i\\) and \\(\\theta\\). In the case of regression, we have \\[\n  y_i = f_{\\theta}(x_i) + \\epsilon, ~ \\epsilon \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2),\n\\] The loss function is then \\[\n    l(\\theta) = - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log p(y_i | x_i, \\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f_{\\theta}(x_i))^2,\n\\]\nNow, let’s demonstrate the gradient descent algorithm on a simple example of linear regression. We will use the iris data set.",

The model is \\[\n    y_i = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_i + \\epsilon_i,\n\\] or in matrix form: \\[\n    y = X \\theta + \\epsilon,\n\\] where \\(\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\), \\(X = [1 ~ x]\\) is the design matrix with first column being all ones.\nThe negative log-likelihood function for the linear regression model is: \\[\n    l(\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\theta_0 - \\theta_1 x_i)^2.\n\\] The gradient is then: \\[\n    \\nabla l(\\theta) = -2 \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\theta_0 - \\theta_1 x_i) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ x_i \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\] In matrix form, we have: \\[\n    \\nabla l(\\theta) = -2 X^T (y - X \\theta).\n\\]\nFirst, let’s load the data and prepare the design matrix.

This is because our loss function is convex (quadratic function of the parameters \\(\\theta\\)), meaning that it has a single global minimum and no local minima and our learning rate of \\(0.0001\\) is small enough to ensure that the algorithm does not overshoot the minimum. However, this is often not the case for more complex models, such as deep neural networks. In those cases, the loss function may oscillate between multiple local minima and saddle points, which can make the convergence of the gradient descent algorithm difficult. In practice, we often use a larger learning rate and a modified version of the gradient descent algorithm, such as Nesterov accelerated gradient descent (NAG) or Adam, to help with the convergence.\n\n\nExample 21.2 (Logistic Regression) Logistic regression is a generalized linear model (GLM) with a logit link function, defined as: \\[\n    \\log \\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\ldots + \\theta_p x_p,\n\\] where \\(p\\) is the probability of the positive class.

    "section": "21.2 Stochastic Gradient Descent",
    "text": "21.2 Stochastic Gradient Descent\nStochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a variant of the gradient descent algorithm. The main difference is that instead of computing the gradient over the entire dataset, SGD computes the gradient over a randomly selected subset of the data. This allows SGD to be applied to estimate models when the dataset is too large to fit into memory, which is often the case with deep learning models. The SGD algorithm replaces the gradient of the negative log-likelihood function with the gradient of the negative log-likelihood function computed over a randomly selected subset of the data \\[\n    \\nabla l(\\theta) \\approx \\dfrac{1}{|B|} \\sum_{i \\in B} \\nabla l(y_i, f(x_i, \\theta)),\n\\] where \\(B \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}\\) is the batch sampled from the dataset. This method can be interpreted as gradient descent using noisy gradients, which are typically called mini-batch gradients with batch size \\(|B|\\).\nSGD is based on the idea of stochastic approximation introduced by Robbins and Monro (1951). Stochastic approximation simply replaces \\(F(l)\\) with its Monte Carlo approximation.\nIn a small mini-batch regime, when \\(|B| \\ll n\\) and typically \\(|B| \\in \\{32,64,\\ldots,1024\\}\\), it was shown that SGD converges faster than the standard gradient descent algorithm, does converge to minimizers of strongly convex functions (the negative log-likelihood function from the exponential family is strongly convex) (Bottou, Curtis, and Nocedal 2018), and is more robust to noise in the data (Hardt, Recht, and Singer 2016). Further, it was shown that it can avoid saddle points, which is often an issue with deep learning log-likelihood functions. In the case of multiple minima, SGD can find a good solution LeCun et al. (2002), meaning that the out-of-sample performance is often worse when trained with large-batch methods as compared to small-batch methods.\nNow, we implement SGD for logistic regression and compare performance for different batch sizes \n\nlrgd_minibatch  = function(x,y, alpha, n_iter, bs) {\n  theta &lt;- matrix(c(0, 0), nrow = 2, ncol = n_iter+1)\n  n = length(y)\n  for (i in 1:n_iter) {\n    s = ((i-1)*bs+1)%%n\n    e = min(s+bs-1,n)\n    xl = x[s:e,]; yl = y[s:e]\n    p = 1/(1+exp(-xl %*% theta[,i]))\n    grad &lt;- -t(xl) %*% (yl - p)\n    # update theta\n    theta[,i+1] &lt;- theta[,i] - alpha * grad\n  }\n  return(theta)\n}\n\nNow run our SGD algorithm with different batch sizes.\n\nset.seed(92) # kuzy\nind = sample(150)\ny = ifelse(iris$Species==\"setosa\",1,0)[ind] # shuffle data\nx = cbind(rep(1,150),iris$Sepal.Length)[ind,] # shuffle data\nnit=200000\nlr = 0.01\nth1 = lrgd_minibatch(x,y,lr,nit,5)\nth2 = lrgd_minibatch(x,y,lr,nit,15)\nth3 = lrgd_minibatch(x,y,lr,nit,30)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe run it with 2^{5} iterations and the learning rate of 0.01 and plot the values of \\(\\theta_1\\) every 1000 iteration. There are a couple of important points we need to highlight when using SGD. First, we shuffle the data before using it. The reason is that if the data is sorted in any way (e.g., by date or by value of one of the inputs), then data within batches can be highly correlated, which reduces the convergence speed. Shuffling helps avoid this issue. Second, the larger the batch size, the smaller the number of iterations required for convergence, which is something we would expect. However, in this specific example, from the computational point of view, the batch size does not change the number of calculations required overall. Let’s look at the same plot, but scale the x-axis according to the amount of computations\n\nplot(ind/1000,th1[1,ind], type='l', ylim=c(0,33), col=1, ylab=expression(theta[1]), xlab=\"Iteration\")\nabline(h=27.83, lty=2)\nlines(ind/1000*3,th2[1,ind], type='l', col=2)\nlines(ind/1000*6,th3[1,ind], type='l', col=3)\nlegend(\"bottomright\", legend=c(5,15,30),col=1:3, lty=1, bty='n',title = \"Batch Size\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several important considerations about choosing the batch size for SGD.\n\nThe larger the batch size, the more memory is required to store the data.\nParallelization is more efficient with larger batch sizes. Modern hardware supports parallelization of matrix operations, which is the main operation in SGD. The larger the batch size, the more efficient the parallelization is. Usually there is a sweet spot \\(|B|\\) for the batch size, which is the largest batch size that can fit into memory or be parallelized. This means it takes the same amount of time to compute an SGD step for batch size \\(1\\) and \\(B\\).\nThird, the larger the batch size, the less noise in the gradient. This means that the larger the batch size, the more accurate the gradient is. However, it was empirically shown that in many applications we should prefer noisier gradients (small batches) to obtain high-quality solutions when the objective function (negative log-likelihood) is non-convex (Keskar et al. 2016).",

    "text": "21.3 Automatic Differentiation (Backpropagation)\nOriginal neural networks (Perceptrons) proposed by Rosenblatt (1958) were single layer feedforward networks with a sigmoid activation function in the output layer. They were trained using the so-called delta rule.\nThe delta rule, introduced by Rosenblatt (1958), provides a simple learning algorithm for single-layer networks. For a single-layer perceptron with output \\(\\hat{y} = \\sigma(w^T x + b)\\), where \\(\\sigma\\) is an activation function, the delta rule updates weights as: \\[\nw^{t+1} = w^t - \\alpha (\\hat{y} - y) \\sigma'(w^T x + b) x\n\\] where \\(\\alpha\\) is the learning rate and \\(y\\) is the target output. This rule is intuitive: when the prediction \\(\\hat{y}\\) differs from the target \\(y\\), we adjust the weights proportionally to the input \\(x\\) and the derivative of the activation function.\nHowever, the delta rule encounters a fundamental limitation with multi-layer networks. Consider a network with hidden layers: \\(h = \\sigma_1(W_1 x + b_1)\\) and \\(\\hat{y} = \\sigma_2(W_2 h + b_2)\\). To update weights \\(W_1\\) in the first layer, we need to compute \\(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W_1}\\), where \\(L\\) is the loss function. By the chain rule: \\[\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W_1} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\hat{y}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial h} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial W_1}\n\\]\nThe delta rule could not efficiently compute this gradient through multiple layers, as it lacked a systematic method for propagating error signals backward through the network. This meant that while single-layer networks could be trained effectively, there was no practical way to train deeper architectures that could learn more complex representations.\nThe inability to train multi-layer networks led to what is now known as the first AI winter in the late 1960s and 1970s. Minsky and Papert (1969) demonstrated that single-layer perceptrons could not solve simple non-linearly separable problems like XOR, and without a method to train multi-layer networks, neural network research largely stagnated. Funding dried up, and many researchers abandoned neural networks in favor of symbolic AI approaches. This period lasted for over a decade, with neural networks considered a dead end by much of the AI community.\nUnknown to most of the neural network community at the time, the solution to training multi-layer networks through systematic application of the chain rule was being developed independently by several researchers. In the Soviet Union, Galushkin (1973) developed methods for training multi-layer networks using gradient-based approaches, though this work remained largely unknown in the West due to the Cold War.\nIn the Western literature, the first clear formulation of backpropagation came from P. Werbos (1974), who in his 1974 PhD thesis at Harvard University introduced the idea of using the chain rule to efficiently compute gradients in multi-layer networks. Werbos explicitly showed how to propagate derivatives backward through a network by decomposing complex functions into simpler components. He refined these ideas further in P. J. Werbos (1982), demonstrating how reverse-mode automatic differentiation could be applied to train neural networks efficiently.\nInterestingly, the same mathematical principle—systematic application of the chain rule for computing derivatives—was being applied in a different context around the same time. Nelder and Wedderburn (1972) introduced Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and developed an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm that explicitly used the chain rule to compute gradients for maximum likelihood estimation.\nTo understand their contribution, consider a GLM where the response variable \\(y_i\\) follows a distribution from the exponential family with mean \\(\\mu_i\\). The model relates the mean to the predictors through a link function \\(g(\\cdot)\\): \\[\ng(\\mu_i) = \\eta_i = x_i^T \\theta\n\\] where \\(x_i\\) is the vector of predictors for observation \\(i\\), \\(\\theta\\) is the parameter vector, and \\(\\eta_i\\) is the linear predictor. For example, in logistic regression (which we saw in Example 21.2), we have \\(g(\\mu) = \\log(\\mu/(1-\\mu))\\) (the logit link).\nThe key innovation of Nelder and Wedderburn was recognizing that computing the gradient of the log-likelihood with respect to \\(\\theta\\) requires systematic application of the chain rule. Specifically, for observation \\(i\\), the gradient decomposes as: \\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\log L}{\\partial \\theta_j} = \\frac{\\partial \\log L}{\\partial \\mu_i} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\mu_i}{\\partial \\eta_i} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\eta_i}{\\partial \\theta_j}\n\\]\nThe first term, \\(\\partial \\log L/\\partial \\mu_i\\), depends on the specific distribution (e.g., Gaussian, Bernoulli, Poisson). For exponential family distributions, this takes the form \\((y_i - \\mu_i)/V(\\mu_i)\\), where \\(V(\\mu_i)\\) is the variance function. The second term, \\(\\partial \\mu_i/\\partial \\eta_i\\), is the derivative of the inverse link function. The third term is simply \\(x_{ij}\\), the \\(j\\)-th predictor value.\nCombining these using the chain rule, they derived the gradient: \\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\log L}{\\partial \\theta_j} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(y_i - \\mu_i)}{V(\\mu_i)} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\mu_i}{\\partial \\eta_i} \\cdot x_{ij}\n\\]\nFor the Newton-Raphson optimization method (also known as Fisher scoring when using expected second derivatives), they needed to compute the Hessian matrix. Applying the chain rule again to the gradient yields the Fisher information matrix with elements: \\[\n\\mathcal{I}_{jk} = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_{ij} x_{ik}\n\\] where the weight \\(w_i = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mu_i}{\\partial \\eta_i}\\right)^2 / V(\\mu_i)\\) is itself computed by the chain rule. This leads to the iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm, where at each iteration \\(t\\) we solve: \\[\n\\theta^{t+1} = \\theta^t + \\mathcal{I}(\\theta^t)^{-1} \\nabla \\log L(\\theta^t)\n\\]\nThe beauty of this formulation is that it decomposes a complex gradient computation into three conceptually simple pieces—the error term, the link function derivative, and the design matrix—and composes them through the chain rule. This is precisely the same principle that underlies backpropagation in neural networks, though applied to a different class of models.\nWhat makes this parallel especially striking is the timing. Nelder and Wedderburn published their GLM framework in 1972, just two years before Werbos’s PhD thesis on backpropagation. Both independently discovered that systematic chain rule application could efficiently compute gradients in compositional models. However, the connection between these developments remained largely unrecognized for decades. The statistical community focused on GLMs for their interpretability and inference properties, while the neural network community emphasized the ability to learn complex representations through multiple layers.\nThe success of GLMs in statistics demonstrated that chain rule-based gradient computation was not only theoretically sound but practically valuable for fitting sophisticated models to real data. Yet this connection to neural networks was not widely recognized at the time. Despite these parallel discoveries, backpropagation did not enter mainstream neural network research until Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams (1986) popularized the systematic use of the chain rule for neural networks and coined the term backpropagation that is now standard in machine learning.\nTo calculate the value of the gradient vector at each step of the optimization process, gradient descent algorithms require calculations of derivatives. In general, there are three different ways to calculate those derivatives. First, we can do it by hand. This is slow and error-prone. Second is numerical differentiation, when a gradient is approximated by a finite difference; for some small \\(h\\), calculate \\(f'(x) \\approx (f(x+h)-f(x))/h\\), which requires two function evaluations. This approach is not backward stable (Griewank, Kulshreshtha, and Walther 2012), meaning that for a small perturbation in input value \\(x\\), the calculated derivative is not the correct one. Lastly, we can use symbolic differentiation or automatic differentiation (AD) which has been used for decades in computer algebra systems such as Mathematica or Maple. Symbolic differentiation uses a tree form representation of a function and applies the chain rule to the tree to calculate the symbolic derivative of a given function.\nThe advantage of symbolic calculations is that the analytical representation of the derivative is available for further analysis, for example, when derivative calculation is an intermediate step of the analysis. A third way to calculate a derivative is to use automatic differentiation (AD). Similar to symbolic differentiation, AD recursively applies the chain rule and calculates the exact value of the derivative, thus avoiding the problem of numerical instability. The difference between AD and symbolic differentiation is that AD provides the value of the derivative evaluated at a specific point, rather than an analytical representation of the derivative.\nAD does not require analytical specification and can be applied to a function defined by a sequence of algebraic manipulations, logical and transcendent functions applied to input variables and specified in computer code. AD can differentiate complex functions which involve IF statements and loops, and AD can be implemented using either forward or backward mode. Consider an example of calculating a derivative of the logistic function \\[\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-(Wx+b)}}.\n\\]\nWhich is implemented as follows:\n\nsigmoid = function(x,b,w){\n  v1 = w*x;\n  v2 = v1 + b\n  v3 = 1/(1+exp(-v2))\n}\n\n\n\nGiven the function \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} = v3\\), the derivative is given by the chain rule as follows: \\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial w} = \\frac{\\partial v_3}{\\partial v_2} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial v_2}{\\partial v_1} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial v_1}{\\partial w} = 1 \\cdot v_3(1-v_3) \\cdot 1 \\cdot x\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial b} = \\frac{\\partial v_3}{\\partial v_2} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial v_2}{\\partial b} = 1 \\cdot v_3(1-v_3) \\cdot 1\n\\]\nIn the forward mode, an auxiliary variable, called a dual number, will be added to each line of the code to track the value of the derivative associated with this line. In our example, if we set x=2, w=3, b=5, we get the calculations given in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction calculations\nDerivative calculations\n\n\n\n\n1. v1 = w*x = 6\n1. dv1 = w = 3 (derivative of v1 with respect to x)\n\n\n2. v2 = v1 + b = 11\n2. dv2 = dv1 = 3 (derivative of v2 with respect to x)\n\n\n3. v3 = 1/(1+exp(-v2)) = 0.99\n3. dv3 = eps2*exp(-v2)/(1+exp(-v2))**2  = 5e-05\n\n\n\nVariables dv1,dv2,dv3 correspond to partial (local) derivatives of each intermediate variable v1,v2,v3 with respect to \\(x\\), and are called dual variables. Tracking for dual variables can either be implemented using source code modification tools that add new code for calculating the dual numbers or via operator overloading.\nThe reverse AD also applies the chain rule recursively but starts from the outer function, as shown in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction calculations\nDerivative calculations\n\n\n\n\n1. v1 = w*x = 6\n4. dv1dx =w; dv1 = dv2*dv1dx = 3*1.3e-05=5e-05\n\n\n2. v2 = v1 + b = 11\n3. dv2dv1 =1; dv2 = dv3*dv2dv1 = 1.3e-05\n\n\n3. v3 = 1/(1+exp(-v2)) = 0.99\n2. dv3dv2 = exp(-v2)/(1+exp(-v2))**2;\n\n\n4. v4 = v3\n1. dv4=1\n\n\n\nFigure 21.2 shows a tree representation of the composition of affine and sigmoid functions (the first layer of our neural network). The numbers in the nodes are the values of the variables at a specific point, and the arrows show the flow of data. During the forward pass (solid arrows), the data flows from inputs (x, w, b) to the final output v3 and all intermediate variables are computed. During the backward pass (dashed arrows), the gradient values flow from the output back to the inputs by applying the chain rule to each variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR\n    %% Input nodes\n    X[\"x = 2&lt;br/&gt;∇x = w × v3(1-v3)\"]\n    W[\"w = 3&lt;br/&gt;∇w = x × v3(1-v3)\"]\n    B[\"b = 5&lt;br/&gt;∇b = v3(1-v3)\"]\n    \n    %% Computation nodes\n    V1[\"v1 = w × x = 6&lt;br/&gt;∇v1 = v3(1-v3)\"]\n    V2[\"v2 = v1 + b = 11&lt;br/&gt;∇v2 = v3(1-v3)\"]\n    NEG[\"-v2 = -11\"]\n    EXP[\"exp(-v2) ≈ 0.0000&lt;br/&gt;∇exp = -v3(1-v3)\"]\n    ONE[\"1\"]\n    ADD1[\"1 + exp(-v2) ≈ 1.0000&lt;br/&gt;∇add = v3(1-v3)\"]\n    V3[\"v3 = 1/(1+exp(-v2)) ≈ 0.99998&lt;br/&gt;∇v3 = 1\"]\n    \n    %% Forward pass connections (solid arrows)\n    X --&gt; V1\n    W --&gt; V1\n    V1 --&gt; V2\n    B --&gt; V2\n    V2 --&gt; NEG\n    NEG --&gt; EXP\n    ONE --&gt; ADD1\n    EXP --&gt; ADD1\n    ADD1 --&gt; V3\n    \n    %% Backward pass connections (dashed arrows - gradient flow)\n    V3 -.-&gt; ADD1\n    ADD1 -.-&gt; EXP\n    ADD1 -.-&gt; ONE\n    EXP -.-&gt; NEG\n    NEG -.-&gt; V2\n    V2 -.-&gt; V1\n    V2 -.-&gt; B\n    V1 -.-&gt; W\n    V1 -.-&gt; X\n    \n    %% Styling\n    classDef input fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#0277bd,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef computation fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#7b1fa2,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef constant fill:#e8f5e8,stroke:#388e3c,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef output fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#f57c00,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class X,W,B input\n    class V1,V2,NEG,EXP,ADD1 computation\n    class ONE constant\n    class V3 output\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.2\n\n\n\n\n\nFor DL, derivatives are calculated by applying the reverse AD algorithm to a model which is defined as a superposition of functions. A model is defined either using a general-purpose language as it is done in PyTorch or through a sequence of function calls defined by framework libraries (e.g., in TensorFlow). Forward AD algorithms calculate the derivative with respect to a single input variable, but reverse AD produces derivatives with respect to all intermediate variables. For models with many parameters, it is much more computationally feasible to perform the reverse AD.\nIn the context of neural networks, the reverse AD algorithm is called back-propagation and was popularized in AI by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams (1986). According to Schmidhuber (2015), the first version of what we call today back-propagation was published in 1970 in a master’s thesis Linnainmaa (1970) and was closely related to the work of Ostrovskii, Volin, and Borisov (1971). However, similar techniques rooted in Pontryagin’s maximization principle were discussed in the context of multi-stage control problems Bryson (1961),bryson1969applied}. Dreyfus (1962) applies back-propagation to calculate the first-order derivative of a return function to numerically solve a variational problem. Later Dreyfus (1973) used back-propagation to derive an efficient algorithm to solve a minimization problem. The first neural network-specific version of back-propagation was proposed in P. Werbos (1974) and an efficient back-propagation algorithm was discussed in P. J. Werbos (1982).\nModern deep learning frameworks fully automate the process of finding derivatives using AD algorithms. For example, PyTorch relies on the autograd library which automatically finds gradients using the back-propagation algorithm. Here is a small code example using the autograd library in jax.\nThe code below implements a simple neural network with one hidden layer and uses back-propagation to find the gradient of the negative log-likelihood function. The model is trained on a synthetic dataset generated from a circle. The code uses the jax library, which is a high-performance numerical computing library that supports automatic differentiation.\n\n\nCode\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom jax import random\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef abline(slope, intercept):\n    \"\"\"Plot a line from slope and intercept\"\"\"\n    axes = plt.gca()\n    x_vals = jnp.array(axes.get_xlim())\n    ylim = axes.get_xlim()\n    y_vals = intercept + slope * x_vals\n    plt.plot(x_vals, y_vals, '-'); plt.ylim(ylim)\n\nd = pd.read_csv('../data/circle.csv').values\nx = d[:, 1:3]; y = d[:, 0]\nk = random.PRNGKey(0)\nw1 = 0.1*random.normal(k,(2,4))\nb1 = 0.01*random.normal(k,(4,))\nw2 = 0.1*random.normal(k,(4,1))\nb2 = 0.01*random.normal(k,(1,))\n\n\n\nfrom jax import grad,jit\ndef sigmoid(x):\n    return 1 / (1 + jnp.exp(-x))\ndef predict(x, w1,b1,w2,b2):\n    z = sigmoid(jnp.dot(x, w1)+b1)\n    return sigmoid(jnp.dot(z, w2)+b2)[:,0]\ndef nll(x, y, w1,b1,w2,b2):\n    yhat = predict(x, w1,b1,w2,b2)\n    return -jnp.sum(y * jnp.log(yhat) + (1 - y) * jnp.log(1 - yhat))\n@jit\ndef gd_step(x, y, w1,b1,w2,b2, lr):\n    grads = grad(nll,argnums=[2,3,4,5])(x, y, w1,b1,w2,b2)\n    return w1 - lr * grads[0],b1 - lr * grads[1],w2 - lr * grads[2],b2 - lr * grads[3]\ndef accuracy(x, y, w1,b1,w2,b2):\n    y_pred = predict(x, w1,b1,w2,b2)\n    return jnp.mean((y_pred &gt; 0.5) == y)\n\n\nfor i in range(1500):\n    w1,b1,w2,b2 = gd_step(x,y,w1,b1,w2,b2,0.02)\nprint(accuracy(x,y,w1,b1,w2,b2))\n\n1.0\n\n\nNote that inside the gradient descent function gd_step we use the grad function to calculate the gradient of the negative log-likelihood function with respect to the weights and biases. The jit decorator is used to compile the function for faster execution. The gd_step function updates the weights and biases using the calculated gradients and a learning rate of 0.02.\nFinally, we can plot the decision boundary of the trained model\n\n\nCode\nfig, ax = plt.subplots();\nax.scatter(x[:,0], x[:,1], c=['r' if x==1 else 'g' for x in y],s=7); plt.xlabel(\"x1\"); plt.ylabel(\"x2\"); plt.xlim(-10,10);\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False);\n# plt.scatter((x[:,1]*w1[1,0] - b1[0])/w1[0,0], x[:,1])\nabline(w1[1,0]/w1[0,0],b1[0]/w1[0,0]);\nabline(w1[1,1]/w1[0,1],b1[1]/w1[0,1]);\nabline(w1[1,2]/w1[0,2],b1[2]/w1[0,2]);\nabline(w1[1,3]/w1[0,3],b1[3]/w1[0,3]);\nplt.show();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the model has learned to separate the two classes. Two of the lines are almost parallel, which is expected. We could have gotten away with using only three hidden units instead of four.",

    "text": "21.4 Stochastic Gradient Descent\nStochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a default standard for minimizing the loss function \\(f(W,b)\\) (maximizing the likelihood) to find the deep learning weights and offsets. SGD simply minimizes the function by taking a negative step along an estimate \\(g^k\\) of the gradient \\(\\nabla f(W^k, b^k)\\) at iteration \\(k\\). The gradients are available via the chain rule applied to the superposition of semi-affine functions. The approximate gradient is estimated by calculating\n\\[\ng^k = \\frac{1}{|E_k|} \\sum_{i \\in E_k} \\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{w,b}( Y_i , \\hat{Y}^k( X_i))\n\\] where \\(E_k \\subset \\{1,\\ldots,T \\}\\) and \\(|E_k|\\) is the number of elements in \\(E_k\\).\nWhen \\(|E_k| &gt;1\\) the algorithm is called batch SGD and simply SGD otherwise. Typically, the subset \\(E\\) is chosen by going cyclically and picking consecutive elements of \\(\\{1,\\ldots,T \\}\\), \\(E_{k+1} = [E_k \\mod T]+1\\). The direction \\(g^k\\) is calculated using a chain rule (a.k.a. back-propagation) providing an unbiased estimator of \\(\\nabla f(W^k, b^k)\\). Specifically, we have\n\\[\n\\mathrm{E}(g^k) = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{i =1}^T \\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{w,b}( Y_i , \\hat{Y}^k( X_i)) = \\nabla f(W^k, b^k).\n\\] At each iteration, the SGD updates the solution \\[\n(W,b)^{k+1} = (W,b)^k - t_k g^k.\n\\]\nDeep learning algorithms use step size \\(t_k\\) (a.k.a. learning rate) that is either kept constant or a simple step size reduction strategy, such as \\(t_k = a\\exp(-kt)\\), is used. The hyperparameters of the reduction schedule are usually found empirically from numerical experiments and observations of the loss function progression.\nOne caveat of SGD is that the descent in \\(f\\) is not guaranteed or can be very slow at every iteration. Stochastic Bayesian approaches ought to alleviate these issues. The variance of the gradient estimate \\(g^k\\) can also be near zero as the iterates converge to a solution. To tackle those problems, coordinate descent (CD) and momentum-based modifications can be applied. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) can also provide a natural alternative and lead to non-linear alternating updates (see Carreira-Perpinán and Wang (2014)).\nThe CD evaluates a single component \\(E_k\\) of the gradient \\(\\nabla f\\) at the current point and then updates the \\(E_k\\)th component of the variable vector in the negative gradient direction. The momentum-based versions of SGD or so-called accelerated algorithms were originally proposed by Nesterov (1983). For more recent discussion, see Nesterov (2013). Momentum adds memory to the search process by combining new gradient information with the previous search directions. Empirically, momentum-based methods have been shown to have better convergence for deep learning networks Sutskever et al. (2013). The gradient only influences changes in the velocity of the update, which then updates the variable\n\\[\nv^{k+1} = \\mu v^k - t_k g((W,b)^k)\n\\] \\[\n(W,b)^{k+1} = (W,b)^k +v^k\n\\]\nThe hyperparameter \\(\\mu\\) controls the damping effect on the rate of update of the variables. The physical analogy is the reduction in kinetic energy that allows to “slow down” the movements at the minima. This parameter can also be chosen empirically using cross-validation.\nNesterov’s momentum method (a.k.a. Nesterov acceleration) calculates the gradient at the point predicted by the momentum. One can view this as a look-ahead strategy with the updating scheme\n\\[\nv^{k+1} = \\mu v^k - t_k g((W,b)^k +v^k)\n\\] \\[\n(W,b)^{k+1} = (W,b)^k +v^k\n\\]\nAnother popular modification are the AdaGrad methods Zeiler (2012), which adaptively scales each of the learning parameter at each iteration\n\\[\nc^{k+1} = c^k + g((W,b)^k)^2\n\\] \\[\n(W,b)^{k+1} = (W,b)^k - t_k g(W,b)^k)/(\\sqrt{c^{k+1}} - a)\n\\]\nwhere \\(a\\) is usually a small number, e.g., \\(a = 10^{-6}\\), that prevents division by zero. RMSprop takes the AdaGrad idea further and puts more weight on recent values of gradient squared to scale the update direction:\n\\[\nc^{k+1} =  dc^k + (1-d)g((W,b)^k)^2\n\\]\nThe Adam method Kingma and Ba (2014) combines both RMSprop and momentum methods; it leads to the following update equations\n\\[\nv^{k+1} = \\mu v^k - (1-\\mu)t_k g((W,b)^k +v^k)\n\\] \\[\nc^{k+1} = dc^k + (1-d)g((W,b)^k)^2\n\\] \\[\n(W,b)^{k+1} = (W,b)^k - t_k v^{k+1}/(\\sqrt{c^{k+1}} - a)\n\\]\nSecond-order methods solve the optimization problem by solving a system of nonlinear equations \\(\\nabla f(W,b) = 0\\) by applying Newton’s method\n\\[\n(W,b)^+ = (W,b) - \\{ \\nabla^2f(W,b) \\}^{-1}\\nabla f(W,b)\n\\]\nWe can see that SGD simply approximates \\(\\nabla^2f(W,b)\\) by \\(1/t\\). The advantages of a second-order method include much faster convergence rates and insensitivity to the conditioning of the problem. In practice, second-order methods are rarely used for deep learning applications Dean et al. (2012). The major disadvantage is the inability to train models using batches of data as SGD does. Since typical deep learning models rely on large-scale datasets, second-order methods become memory and computationally prohibitive even for modest-sized training datasets.",

    "text": "21.5 Why Robbins-Monro?\nThe Robbins-Monro algorithm was introduced in their seminal 1951 paper “A Stochastic Approximation Method” Robbins and Monro (1951).

For \\(a_n = c/n\\) with \\(c &gt; 0\\), the algorithm achieves optimal convergence rates.\nThis foundational work established the theoretical basis for stochastic approximation methods that are now widely used in machine learning, particularly in stochastic gradient descent and related optimization algorithms.\nInference on estimands can be expressed as the solution to a convex optimization problem. In addition to means, this includes medians, other quantiles, linear and logistic regression coefficients, and many other quantities. Formally, we consider estimands of the form\n\\[\\theta^* = \\arg\\min_{\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^p} \\mathbb{E}[\\ell_\\theta(X_i, Y_i)],\\]\nfor a loss function \\(\\ell_\\theta: \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{Y} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) that is convex in \\(\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^p\\), for some \\(p \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Throughout, we take the existence of \\(\\theta^*\\) as given. If the minimizer is not unique, our method will return a confidence set guaranteed to contain all minimizers. Under mild conditions, convexity ensures that \\(\\theta^*\\) can also be expressed as the value solving \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[g_\\theta(X_i, Y_i)] = 0.\n\\tag{21.1}\\]\nwhere \\(g_\\theta: \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{Y} \\to \\mathbb{R}^p\\) is a subgradient of \\(\\ell_\\theta\\) with respect to \\(\\theta\\). We will call convex estimation problems where \\(\\theta^*\\) satisfies Equation 21.1 nondegenerate, and we will later discuss mild conditions that ensure this regularity.",

    "text": "21.6 The EM, ECM, and ECME algorithms\nMCMC methods have been used extensively to perform numerical integration. There is also interest in using simulation-based methods to optimise functions. The EM algorithm is an algorithm in a general class of Q-maximisation algorithms that finds a (deterministic) sequence \\(\\{\\theta^{(g)}\\}\\) converging to \\(\\arg\\max_{\\theta \\in \\Theta} Q(\\theta)\\).\nFirst, define a function \\(Q(\\theta,\\phi)\\) such that \\(Q(\\theta) = Q(\\theta,\\theta)\\) and it satisfies a convexity constraint \\(Q(\\theta,\\phi) \\geq Q(\\theta,\\theta)\\). Then define\n\\[\\theta^{(g+1)} = \\arg\\max_{\\theta \\in \\Theta} Q(\\theta,\\theta^{(g)})\\]\nThis satisfies the convexity constraint \\(Q(\\theta,\\theta) \\geq Q(\\theta,\\phi)\\) for any \\(\\phi\\). In order to prove convergence, you get a sequence of inequalities\n\\[Q(\\theta^{(0)},\\theta^{(0)}) \\leq Q(\\theta^{(1)},\\theta^{(0)}) \\leq Q(\\theta^{(1)},\\theta^{(1)}) \\leq \\ldots \\leq Q\\]\nIn many models we have to deal with a latent variable and require estimation where integration is also involved. For example, suppose that we have a triple \\((y,z,\\theta)\\) with joint probability specification \\(p(y,z,\\theta) = p(y|z,\\theta)p(z,\\theta)\\). This can occur in missing data problems and estimation problems in mixture models.\nA standard application of the EM algorithm is to find\n\\[\\arg\\max_{\\theta \\in \\Theta} \\int_z p(y|z,\\theta)p(z|\\theta)dz\\]\nAs we are just finding an optimum, you do not need the prior specification \\(p(\\theta)\\). The EM algorithm finds a sequence of parameter values \\(\\theta^{(g)}\\) by alternating between an expectation and a maximisation step. This still requires the numerical (or analytical) computation of the criteria function \\(Q(\\theta,\\theta^{(g)})\\) described below.\nEM algorithms have been used extensively in mixture models and missing data problems. The EM algorithm uses the particular choice where\n\\[Q(\\theta) = \\log p(y|\\theta) = \\log \\int p(y,z|\\theta)dz\\]\nHere the likelihood has a mixture representation where \\(z\\) is the latent variable (missing data, state variable etc.). This is termed a Q-maximization algorithm with:\n\\[Q(\\theta,\\theta^{(g)}) = \\int \\log p(y|z,\\theta)p(z|\\theta^{(g)},y)dz = \\mathbb{E}_{z|\\theta^{(g)},y} [\\log p(y|z,\\theta)]\\]\nTo implement EM you need to be able to calculate \\(Q(\\theta,\\theta^{(g)})\\) and optimize at each iteration.\nThe EM algorithm and its extensions ECM and ECME are methods of computing maximum likelihood estimates or posterior modes in the presence of missing data. Let the objective function be \\(\\ell(\\theta) = \\log p(\\theta|y) + c(y)\\), where \\(c(y)\\) is a possibly unknown normalizing constant that does not depend on \\(\\beta\\) and \\(y\\) denotes observed data. We have a mixture representation,\n\\[p(\\theta|y) = \\int p(\\theta,z|y)dz = \\int p(\\theta|z,y)p(z|y)dz\\]\nwhere distribution of the latent variables is \\(p(z|\\theta,y) = p(y|\\theta,z)p(z|\\theta)/p(y|\\theta)\\).\nIn some cases the complete data log-posterior is simple enough for \\(\\arg\\max_{\\theta} \\log p(\\theta|z,y)\\) to be computed in closed form. The EM algorithm alternates between the Expectation and Maximization steps for which it is named. The E-step and M-step computes\n\\[Q(\\beta|\\beta^{(g)}) = \\mathbb{E}_{z|\\beta^{(g)},y} [\\log p(y,z|\\beta)] = \\int \\log p(y,z|\\beta)p(z|\\beta^{(g)},y)dz\\]\n\\[\\beta^{(g+1)} = \\arg\\max_{\\beta} Q(\\beta|\\beta^{(g)})\\]\nThis has an important monotonicity property that ensures \\(\\ell(\\beta^{(g)}) \\leq \\ell(\\beta^{(g+1)})\\) for all \\(g\\). In fact, the monotonicity proof given by Dempster et al. (1977) shows that any \\(\\beta\\) with \\(Q(\\beta,\\beta^{(g)}) \\geq Q(\\beta^{(g)},\\beta^{(g)})\\) also satisfies the log-likelihood inequality \\(\\ell(\\beta) \\geq \\ell(\\beta^{(g)})\\).\nIn problems with many parameters the M-step of EM may be difficult. In this case \\(\\theta\\) may be partitioned into components \\((\\theta_1,\\ldots,\\theta_k)\\) in such a way that maximizing \\(\\log p(\\theta_j|\\theta_{-j},z,y)\\) is easy. The ECM algorithm pairs the EM algorithm’s E-step with \\(k\\) conditional maximization (CM) steps, each maximizing \\(Q\\) over one component \\(\\theta_j\\) with each component of \\(\\theta_{-j}\\) fixed at the most recent value. Due to the fact that each CM step increases \\(Q\\), the ECM algorithm retains the monotonicity property. The ECME algorithm replaces some of ECM’s CM steps with maximizations over \\(\\ell\\) instead of \\(Q\\). Liu and Rubin (1994) show that doing so can greatly increase the rate of convergence.\nIn many cases we will have a parameter vector \\(\\theta = (\\beta,\\nu)\\) partitioned into its components and a missing data vector \\(z = (\\lambda,\\omega)\\). Then we compute the \\(Q(\\beta,\\nu|\\beta^{(g)},\\nu^{(g)})\\) objective function and then compute E- and M steps from this to provide an iterative algorithm for updating parameters. To update the hyperparameter \\(\\nu\\) we can maximize the fully data posterior \\(p(\\beta,\\nu|y)\\) with \\(\\beta\\) fixed at \\(\\beta^{(g+1)}\\). The algorithm can be summarized as follows:\n\\[\\beta^{(g+1)} = \\arg\\max_{\\beta} Q(\\beta|\\beta^{(g)},\\nu^{(g)}) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad Q(\\beta|\\beta^{(g)},\\nu^{(g)}) = \\mathbb{E}_{z|\\beta^{(g)},\\nu^{(g)},y} \\log p(y,z|\\beta,\\nu^{(g)})\\]\n\\[\\nu^{(g+1)} = \\arg\\max_{\\nu} \\log p(\\beta^{(g+1)},\\nu|y)\\]\n\nECM and ECME Extensions\nIn problems with many parameters, the M-step of EM may be difficult. In this case \\(\\theta\\) may be partitioned into components \\((\\theta_1,\\ldots,\\theta_k)\\) such that maximizing \\(\\log p(\\theta_j|\\theta_{-j},z,y)\\) is manageable.\nThe ECM (Expectation/Conditional Maximization) algorithm pairs the EM algorithm’s E-step with \\(k\\) conditional maximization (CM) steps, each maximizing \\(Q\\) over one component \\(\\theta_j\\) with each component of \\(\\theta_{-j}\\) fixed at the most recent value. Due to the fact that each CM step increases \\(Q\\), the ECM algorithm retains the monotonicity property.\nThe ECME (Expectation/Conditional Maximization Either) algorithm replaces some of ECM’s CM steps with maximizations over \\(\\ell\\) instead of \\(Q\\). Liu and Rubin (1994) show that doing so can greatly increase the rate of convergence.\nFor a parameter vector \\(\\theta = (\\beta,\\nu)\\) partitioned into components and missing data vector \\(z = (\\lambda,\\omega)\\), the ECME algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\beta^{(g+1)} &= \\arg\\max_{\\beta} Q(\\beta|\\beta^{(g)},\\nu^{(g)}) \\\\\n&\\text{where } Q(\\beta|\\beta^{(g)},\\nu^{(g)}) = \\mathbb{E}_{z|\\beta^{(g)},\\nu^{(g)},y}[\\log p(y,z|\\beta,\\nu^{(g)})] \\\\\n\\nu^{(g+1)} &= \\arg\\max_{\\nu} \\log p(\\beta^{(g+1)},\\nu|y)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe key insight is that for updating hyperparameter \\(\\nu\\), we maximize the fully observed data posterior \\(p(\\beta,\\nu|y)\\) with \\(\\beta\\) fixed at \\(\\beta^{(g+1)}\\), rather than the Q-function. This often leads to simpler optimization problems and faster convergence.\n\nExample 21.3 Simulated Annealing (SA) is a simulation-based approach to finding\n\\[\\hat{\\theta} = \\arg\\max_{\\theta \\in \\Theta} H(\\theta)\\]\n\\[\\pi_J(\\theta) = \\frac{e^{-JH(\\theta)}}{\\int e^{JH(\\theta)}d\\mu(\\theta)}\\]\nwhere \\(J\\) is a temperature parameter. Instead of looking at derivatives and performing gradient-based optimization you can simulate from the sequence of densities. This forms a time-homogeneous Markov chain and under suitable regularity conditions on the relaxation schedule for the temperature we have \\(\\theta^{(g)} \\to \\hat{\\theta}\\). The main caveat is that we need to know the criterion function \\(H(\\theta)\\) to evaluate the Metropolis probability for sampling from the sequence of densities. This is not always available.\nAn interesting generalisation which is appropriate in latent variable mixture models is the following. Suppose that \\(H(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{z|\\theta} \\{H(z,\\theta)\\}\\) is unavailable in closed-form where without loss of generality we assume that \\(H(z,\\theta) \\geq 0\\). In this case we can use latent variable simulated annealing (LVSA) methods. Define a joint probability distribution for \\(z_J = (z_1,\\ldots,z_J)\\) as\n\\[\\pi_J(z_J,\\theta) \\propto \\prod_{j=1}^J H(z_j,\\theta)p(z_j|\\theta)\\mu(\\theta)\\]\nfor some measure \\(\\mu\\) which ensures integrability of the joint. This distribution has the property that its marginal distribution on \\(\\theta\\) is given by\n\\[\\pi_J(\\theta) \\propto \\mathbb{E}_{z|\\theta} \\{H(z,\\theta)\\}^J \\mu(\\theta) = e^{J \\ln H(\\theta)}\\mu(\\theta)\\]\nBy the simulated annealing argument we see that this marginal collapses on the maximum of \\(\\ln H(\\theta)\\). The advantage of this approach is that it is typically straightforward to sample with MCMC from the conditionals:\n\\[\\pi_J(z_i|\\theta) \\sim H(z_j,\\theta)p(z_j|\\theta) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\pi_J(\\theta|z) \\sim \\prod_{j=1}^J H(z_j,\\theta)p(z_j|\\theta)\\mu(\\theta)\\]\nJacquier, Johannes and Polson (2007) apply this framework to finding MLE estimates for commonly encountered latent variable models. The LVSA approach is particularly useful when the criterion function involves complex integrals that make direct optimization challenging, but where sampling from the conditional distributions remains tractable.\n\n\n\n\n\nBottou, Léon, Frank E Curtis, and Jorge Nocedal. 2018. “Optimization Methods for Large-Scale Machine Learning.” SIAM Review 60 (2): 223–311.\n\n\nBryson, Arthur E. 1961. “A Gradient Method for Optimizing Multi-Stage Allocation Processes.” In Proc.

    "text": "22.1 MEU\nLet \\((X,Y) \\sim P_{X,Y}\\) be input-output pairs and \\(P_{X,Y}\\) a joint measure from which we can simulate a training dataset \\((X_i, Y_i)_{i=1}^N \\sim P_{X,Y}\\). Standard prediction techniques focus on the conditional posterior mean \\(\\hat{X}(Y) = E(X|Y) = f(Y)\\) of the input given the output. To do this, consider the multivariate non-parametric regression \\(X = f(Y) + \\epsilon\\) and provide methods for estimating the conditional mean. Typical estimators, \\(\\hat{f}\\), include KNN and kernel methods. Recently, deep learners have been proposed and the theoretical properties of superpositions of affine functions (a.k.a. ridge functions) have been provided N. G. Polson and Sokolov (2023).\nGenerative methods take this approach one step further. Let \\(Z \\sim P_Z\\) be a base measure for a latent variable, \\(Z\\), typically a standard multivariate normal or vector of uniforms. The goal of generative methods is to characterize the posterior measure \\(P_{X|Y}\\) from the training data \\((X_i, Y_i)_{i=1}^N \\sim P_{X,Y}\\) where \\(N\\) is chosen to be suitably large. A deep learner is used to estimate \\(\\hat{f}\\) via the non-parametric regression \\(X = f(Y, Z)\\). In the case where \\(Z\\) is uniform, this amounts to inverse CDF sampling, namely \\(X = F_{X|Y}^{-1}(U)\\).\nIn general, we characterize the posterior map for any output \\(Y\\). Simply evaluate the network at any \\(Y\\) via the transport map \\[\nX = H(S(Y), \\psi(Z))\n\\] from a new base draw, \\(Z\\). Here \\(\\psi\\) denotes the cosine embedding so that the architecture for the latent variable corresponds to a Fourier approximation with rates of convergence given by \\(O(N^{-\\frac{1}{2}})\\) (see Barron (1993)). The deep learner is estimated via a quantile NN from the triples \\((X_i, Y_i, Z_i)_{i=1}^N \\sim P_{X,Y} \\times P_Z\\). The ensuing estimator \\(\\hat{H}_N\\) can be thought of as a transport map from the base distribution to the posterior as required.\nSpecifically, the idea of generative methods is straightforward. Let \\(y\\) denote data and \\(\\theta\\) a vector of parameters including any hidden states (a.k.a. latent variables) \\(z\\). First, we generate a “look-up” table of “fake” data \\(\\{y^{(i)}, \\theta^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^N\\). By simulating a training dataset of outputs and parameters, we can use deep learning to solve for the inverse map via a supervised learning problem. Generative methods have the advantage of being likelihood-free. For example, our model might be specified by a forward map \\(y^{(i)} = f(\\theta^{(i)})\\) rather than a traditional random draw from a likelihood function \\(y^{(i)} \\sim p(y^{(i)}|\\theta^{(i)})\\).\nGenerative methods have a number of advantages. First, they are density-free. Hence they can be applied in a variety of contexts such as computer simulation and economics where traditional methods are computationally more challenging. Second, they naturally extend to decision problems. Third, they exploit the use of deep neural networks such as quantile NNs. Hence they naturally provide good forecasting tools.\nPosterior uncertainty is solved via the inverse non-parametric regression problem where we predict \\(\\theta^{(i)}\\) from \\(y^{(i)}\\) and \\(\\tau^{(i)}\\) which is an independent base distribution, \\(p(\\tau)\\). The base distribution is typically uniform or a very high-dimensional Gaussian vector. Then we need to train a deep neural network, \\(H\\), on \\[\n\\theta^{(i)} = H(S(y^{(i)}), \\tau^{(i)}).\n\\] Here \\(S(y)\\) is a statistic used to perform dimension reduction with respect to the signal distribution. Specifying \\(H\\) is the key to the efficiency of the approach. N. Polson, Ruggeri, and Sokolov (2024) propose the use of quantile neural networks implemented with ReLU activation functions.\nTo extend our generative method to MEU problems, we assume that the utility function \\(U\\) is given. Then we simply draw additional associated utilities \\(U^{(i)}_d \\defeq U(d,\\theta^{(i)})\\) for a given decision \\(d\\) and \\(\\theta^{(i)}\\) draw from above. Then we append the utilities to our training dataset including the baseline distribution \\(\\tau^{(i)}\\) to yield a new training dataset \\[\n\\{U_d^{(i)}, y^{(i)}, \\theta^{(i)}, \\tau^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^N.\n\\] Now we construct a non-parametric estimator of the form \\[\nU_d^{(i)} = H(S(y^{(i)}), \\theta^{(i)}, \\tau^{(i)}, d),\n\\] Given that the posterior quantiles of the distributional utility, denoted by \\(F^{-1}_{U|d,y}(\\tau)\\), are represented as a quantile neural network, we then use a key identity which shows how to represent any expectation as a marginal over quantiles, namely \\[\nE_{\\theta|y}[U(d, \\theta)] = \\int_0^1 F^{-1}_{U|d,y}(\\tau) d\\tau\n\\] The optimal decision function simply maximizes the expected utility \\[\nd^\\star(y) \\defeq \\arg \\max_d E_{\\theta|y}[U(d, \\theta)]\n\\]\nto fix notation and to allow for deterministic updates (i.e., measures rather than probabilities), let \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) denote a locally compact metric space of signals, denoted by \\(y\\), and \\(\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{Y})\\) the Borel \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra of \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\). Let \\(\\lambda\\) be a measure on the measurable space of signals \\((\\mathcal{Y}, \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{Y}))\\). Let \\(P(dy|\\theta)\\) denote the conditional distribution of signals given the parameters. Let \\(\\Theta\\) denote a locally compact metric space of admissible parameters (a.k.a. hidden states and latent variables \\(z \\in \\mathcal{Z}\\)) and \\(\\mathcal{B}(\\Theta)\\) the Borel \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra of \\(\\Theta\\). Let \\(\\mu\\) be a measure on the measurable space of parameters \\((\\Theta, \\mathcal{B}(\\Theta))\\). Let \\(\\Pi(d\\theta|y)\\) denote the conditional distribution of the parameters given the observed signal \\(y\\) (a.k.a., the posterior distribution). In many cases, \\(\\Pi\\) is absolutely continuous with density \\(\\pi\\) such that \\[\n\\Pi(d\\theta|y) = \\pi(\\theta|y) \\mu(d\\theta).\n\\] Moreover, we will write \\(\\Pi(d\\theta) = \\pi(\\theta) \\mu(d\\theta)\\) for prior density \\(\\pi\\) when available. In the case of likelihood-free models, the output is simply specified by a map (a.k.a. forward equation) \\[\ny = f(\\theta)\n\\] When a likelihood \\(p(y|\\theta)\\) is available w.r.t. the measure \\(\\lambda\\), we write \\[\nP(dy|\\theta) = p(y|\\theta) \\lambda(dy).\n\\] There are a number of advantages to such an approach, primarily the fact that they are density-free. They use simulation methods and deep neural networks to invert the prior to posterior map. We build on this framework and show how to incorporate utilities into the generative procedure.\nNoise Outsourcing Theorem: If \\((Y, \\Theta)\\) are random variables in a Borel space \\((\\mathcal{Y}, \\Theta)\\), then there exists a random variable \\(\\tau \\sim U(0,1)\\) which is independent of \\(Y\\) and a function \\(H: [0,1] \\times \\mathcal{Y} \\rightarrow \\Theta\\) such that \\[\n(Y, \\Theta) \\stackrel{a.s.}{=} (Y, H(Y, \\tau))\n\\] Hence the existence of \\(H\\) follows from the noise outsourcing theorem Kallenberg (1997). Moreover, if there is a statistic \\(S(Y)\\) with \\(Y\\) independent of \\(\\Theta | S(Y)\\), then \\[\n\\Theta\\mid Y \\stackrel{a.s.}{=} H(S(Y), \\tau).\n\\] The role of \\(S(Y)\\) is equivalent to the ABC literature. It performs dimension reduction in \\(n\\), the dimensionality of the signal. Our approach is then to use a deep neural network first to calculate the inverse probability map (i.e., posterior) \\(\\theta \\stackrel{D}{=} F^{-1}_{\\theta|y}(\\tau)\\) where \\(\\tau\\) is a vector of uniforms. In the multi-parameter case, we use an RNN or autoregressive structure where we model a vector via a sequence \\((F^{-1}_{\\theta_1}(\\tau_1), F^{-1}_{\\theta_2|\\theta_1}(\\tau_2), \\ldots)\\). A remarkable result due to Brillinger (2012) shows that we can learn \\(S\\) independent of \\(H\\) simply via OLS.\nAs a default choice of network architecture, we will use a ReLU network for the posterior quantile map. The first layer of the network is given by the utility function and hence this is what makes the method different from learning the posterior and then directly using naive Monte Carlo to estimate expected utility. This would be inefficient as quite often the utility function places high weight on regions of low posterior probability representing tail risk.",

It is also known as earth mover’s distance and can be calculated using order statistics (Levina and Bickel 2001). For quantile functions \\(F^{-1}_U\\) and \\(F^{-1}_V\\) the 1-Wasserstein distance is given by\n\\[\nW_1(F^{-1}_U, F^{-1}_V) = \\int_0^1 |F^{-1}_U(\\tau) - F^{-1}_V(\\tau)| d\\tau\n\\]\nIt can be shown that Wasserstein GAN networks outperform vanilla GANs due to the improved quantile metric. \\(q = F^{-1}_U(\\tau)\\) minimizes the expected quantile loss\n\\[\nE_U[\\rho_{\\tau}(u-q)]\n\\]\nQuantile regression can be shown to minimize the 1-Wasserstein metric. A related loss is the quantile divergence,\n\\[\nq(U,V) = \\int_0^1 \\int_{F^{-1}_U(q)}^{F^{-1}_V(q)} (F_U(\\tau)-q) dq d\\tau\n\\]\nThe quantile regression likelihood function is an asymmetric function that penalizes overestimation errors with weight \\(\\tau\\) and underestimation errors with weight \\(1-\\tau\\). For a given input-output pair \\((x, y)\\), and the quantile function \\(f(x, \\theta)\\), parametrized by \\(\\theta\\), the quantile loss is \\(\\rho_{\\tau}(u) = u(\\tau - I(u &lt; 0))\\), where \\(u = y - f(x)\\). From the implementation point of view, a more convenient form of this function is\n\\[\n\\rho_{\\tau}(u) = \\max(u\\tau, u(\\tau-1))\n\\]\nGiven a training data \\(\\{x_i, y_i\\}_{i=1}^N\\), and given quantile \\(\\tau\\), the loss is\n\\[\nL_{\\tau}(\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\rho_{\\tau}(y_i - f(\\tau, x_i, \\theta))\n\\]\nFurther, we empirically found that adding a mean-squared loss to this objective function improves the predictive power of the model; thus the loss function we use is\n\\[\n\\alpha L_{\\tau}(\\theta) + \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - f(x_i, \\theta))^2\n\\]\nOne approach to learning the quantile function is to use a set of quantiles \\(0 &lt; \\tau_1 &lt; \\tau_2 &lt; \\ldots &lt; \\tau_K &lt; 1\\) and then learn \\(K\\) quantile functions simultaneously by minimizing\n\\[\nL(\\theta, \\tau_1, \\ldots, \\tau_K) = \\frac{1}{N K} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{k=1}^K \\rho_{\\tau_k}(y_i - f_{\\tau_k}(x_i, \\theta_k))\n\\]\nThe corresponding optimization problem of minimizing \\(L(\\theta)\\) can be augmented by adding a non-crossing constraint\n\\[\nf_{\\tau_i}(x, \\theta_i) &lt; f_{\\tau_j}(x, \\theta_j), \\quad \\forall x, \\; i &lt; j\n\\]\nThe non-crossing constraint has been considered by several authors, including (Chernozhukov, Fernández-Val, and Galichon 2010; Cannon 2018).\n\nCosine Embedding for \\(\\tau\\)\nTo learn an inverse CDF (quantile function) \\(F^{-1}(\\tau, y) = f_\\theta(\\tau, y)\\), we will use a kernel embedding trick and augment the predictor space. We then represent the quantile function as a function of superposition for two other functions:\n\\[\nF^{-1}(\\tau, y) = f_\\theta(\\tau, y) = g(\\psi(y) \\circ \\phi(\\tau))\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\circ\\) is the element-wise multiplication operator. Both functions \\(g\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are feed-forward neural networks. \\(\\phi\\) is a cosine embedding. To avoid overfitting, we use a sufficiently large training dataset (see (Dabney et al. 2018) in a reinforcement learning context).\nLet \\(g\\) and \\(\\psi\\) be feed-forward neural networks and \\(\\phi\\) a cosine embedding given by\n\\[\n\\phi_j(\\tau) = \\mathrm{ReLU}\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\cos(\\pi i \\tau) w_{ij} + b_j\\right)\n\\]\nWe now illustrate our approach with a simple synthetic dataset.",

    "text": "23.1 Convolutions\nThe problem of pattern recognition in images is a very broad one. It encompasses tasks such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, image captioning, and image generation. In this chapter, we will focus on the first two tasks, which are the most common ones. We start by demonstrating how to classify images with a fully-connected neural network. Then, we will show how to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to improve classification accuracy. Finally, we will show how to detect objects in images by using a pre-trained model. The problem of image classification is the problem of mapping an image to a class label. In this chapter, we will use the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits. The goal is to classify each image into one of the 10 possible classes (0-9).\nWe will use the jax library to implement the neural networks. jax is a library for numerical computing that is similar to numpy, but it is designed to work with accelerators like GPUs and TPUs. It also supports automatic differentiation, which is very useful for training neural networks. The two main computational tools required to train a neural network model are automatic differentiation and linear algebra operations, mainly matrix multiplication. jax provides both of these tools. It also provides a jit function that can be used to compile a function to run on accelerators. This can significantly speed up the computation. The matrix operation in jax is implemented in the dot function.\nImage data is represented as a matrix of pixel values. For example, a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels can be represented as a matrix of shape (28, 28). A color image of size 28x28 pixels can be represented as a three-dimensional array of shape (28, 28, 3), where the last dimension represents the red, green, and blue channels. In this chapter, we will use grayscale images, so we will represent each image as a matrix.\nIn this chapter, we will consider the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits. Each image is a grayscale image of size 28×28 pixels. The original dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. For simplicity, we will use only the test dataset. Each image is labeled with the digit it represents. The goal is to classify each image into one of the 10 possible classes (0-9).\nThe dataset contains images and corresponding labels with the digit it represents. The goal is to classify each image into one of the 10 possible classes (0-9). The straightforward approach is to build a classification model using a fully connected neural network. The input to the model is a 28×28 matrix, which is reshaped into a vector of size 784. The output of the model is a vector of size 10, which represents the probability of each class. First, we split the set of 10,000 images and use 80% for training and 20% for validation. We shuffle the data before splitting to avoid any bias in the train/test datasets. Let’s load and prepare the data\nThe model is trained by minimizing the cross-entropy loss and we use accuracy to evaluate the model.\nFinally, we implement the feed-forward network with \\(\\tanh\\) activation. The last layer is a linear layer with the \\(z_i - \\ln \\left(\\sum_j e^{z_j}\\right)\\) function applied component-wise. Thus, our predict function simply returns the logarithm of the probability of each class. Typically we would use the softmax function to compute the probability of each class. Given a vector of logits \\(z\\), the softmax function is defined as follows: \\[\n\\sigma(z)_i = \\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K}e^{z_j}}\n\\] However, the softmax function is numerically unstable when the input values are large. If we take the logarithm of the softmax function, we get the following expression: \\[\n\\ln\\sigma(z)_i = z_i - \\ln\\sum_{j=1}^{K}e^{z_j}\n\\] This is exactly what we need to compute the cross-entropy loss.\nNow we are ready to implement the SGD loop to train the model.\nUsing a fully connected neural network to classify images has some limitations. The main limitation is that it does not take into account the spatial structure of the image and treats each pixel independently. As a result, it does not perform well on real-life images and has a large number of parameters. Images have a spatial structure, and this spatial structure contains important information that can be used to improve classification accuracy. For example, it is not unusual to find that the same element can appear in different parts of the image, such as a background with a solid color or a specific texture, such as grass or sky.\nApplying a filter to an image is a way to extract features from the image. A filter is a small matrix that is used to extract features from the image. The filter is applied to the image by sliding it over the image and computing the dot product at each position. The result is a new image that contains the features extracted by the filter. The filter is also called a kernel. The size of the filter is called the kernel size. The kernel size is usually an odd number, such as 3×3 or 5×5. The kernel size determines the receptive field of the filter. The receptive field is the region of the input image that is used to compute the output. The stride is the number of pixels by which the filter is shifted at each step, and it determines the size of the output image. The process of convolving a filter with an image is called a convolution operation and it is similar to the approach used by kernel smoothing in statistics.\nLet us look at a one-dimensional example. Suppose we have a one-dimensional input signal \\(x\\) and a one-dimensional filter \\(w\\). The convolution of \\(x\\) and \\(w\\) is defined as follows: \\[\n(x \\ast w)(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^{h}x(t+i)w(i),\n\\] where \\(h\\) is the size of the filter. The convolution operation is used to filter the input signal.\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfrom jax import random\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\nimport numpy as np\n\nkey = random.PRNGKey(1701)\n\nx = jnp.linspace(0, 10, 500)\ny = jnp.sin(x) + 0.2 * random.normal(key, shape=(500,))\n\nwindow = jnp.ones(10) / 10\ny_smooth = jnp.convolve(y, window, mode='same')\n\nplt.plot(x, y, 'lightgray')\n\n[&lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x30bb5d8e0&gt;]\n\nplt.plot(x, y_smooth, 'black');\nWe will demonstrate the concept using a simple example, where we have a 5×5 image and a 3×3 filter. We need to classify each image into one of the three classes: cross, diagonal, and right-diagonal.\nThe filter is applied to the image by sliding it over the image and computing the dot product at each position. The result is a new image that contains the features extracted by the filter. The filter is also called a kernel. The size of the filter is called the kernel size. The kernel size is usually an odd number, such as 3x3 or 5x5. The kernel size determines the receptive field of the filter. The receptive field is the region of the input image that is used to compute the output. The stride is the number of pixels by which the filter is shifted at each step. The stride determines the size of the output image. The process of convolving a filter with an image is called a convolution operation.\nWe will use two filters.\n[[1. 0. 0.]\n [0. 1. 0.]\n [0. 0. 1.]]\n\n\n[[0. 0. 1.]\n [0. 1. 0.]\n [1. 0. 0.]]\nThe first filter is designed to detect a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right. The second filter is designed to detect a diagonal line from the top right to the bottom left. We will apply the filters to the cross image and the diagonal image.\n[[3. 0. 1.]\n [0. 3. 0.]\n [1. 0. 3.]]\n[[1. 0. 3.]\n [0. 3. 0.]\n [3. 0. 1.]]\nWe see that both outputs have pixels with high values. However, when we apply the same two filters to the diagonal image, we get different results.\nThe result of applying the second filter to the diagonal image is a matrix close to zero. This is because the filter is designed to detect a diagonal line from the top right to the bottom left, and the diagonal image does not contain such a line. We use this observation to design the next layer of our network, which is a pooling layer. The simplest one is the max-pool that simply returns the pixel with the highest value in the receptive field. Finally, we concatenate the outputs of the pooling layer and apply a fully connected layer to classify the image. Let us compare the predictions for the three images.\nzrd, outrd1, outrd2 = cnn(imgrd,f1,f2)\nprint(f'Cross: {zx}')\n\nCross: [0.26163495 0.26163495 0.47673005]\n\nprint(f'Diagonal: {zd}')\n\nDiagonal: [0.5937724  0.08035836 0.32586923]\n\nprint(f'Right-Diagonal: {zrd}')\n\nRight-Diagonal: [0.08035836 0.5937724  0.32586923]\nThe model correctly predicted all three classes.\nNow we return to the MNIST example and use higher-level functions to implement the convolutional neural network.\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom torch.nn import functional as F\nx = parse_images(\"../data/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz\")\ny = parse_labels(\"../data/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz\")\nclass Net(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(Net, self).__init__()\n        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, 3, 1)\n        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, 3, 1)\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(9216, 128)\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.conv1(x)\n        x = F.relu(x)\n        x = self.conv2(x)\n        x = F.relu(x)\n        x = F.max_pool2d(x, 2)\n        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)\n        x = self.fc1(x)\n        x = F.relu(x)\n        x = self.fc2(x)\n        output = F.log_softmax(x, dim=1)\n        return output\n\ndef data_stream():\n    perm = rng.permutation(num_train)\n    while True:\n        for i in range(num_batches):\n            batch_idx = perm[i * batch_size:(i + 1) * batch_size]\n            yield torch.from_numpy(x[batch_idx,:,:]/ np.float32(255.))[:, None, :, :], torch.from_numpy(y[batch_idx])\n\ndef train(model, optimizer):\n    model.train()\n    batches = data_stream()\n    for epoch in range(num_epochs):\n        for _ in range(num_batches):\n            optimizer.zero_grad()\n            data, target = next(batches)\n            output = model(data)\n            loss = F.nll_loss(output, target)\n            loss.backward()\n            optimizer.step()\n        print(f\"Epoch {epoch}: Loss {loss.item()}\")\n\nmodel = Net()\noptimizer = torch.optim.Adadelta(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)\ntrain(model, optimizer)\n\nEpoch 0: Loss 0.7418769001960754\nEpoch 1: Loss 0.4432511329650879\nEpoch 2: Loss 0.3278657793998718\nEpoch 3: Loss 0.2533665895462036\nEpoch 4: Loss 0.19742149114608765\nEpoch 5: Loss 0.15801630914211273\nEpoch 6: Loss 0.12804652750492096\nEpoch 7: Loss 0.10280223190784454\nEpoch 8: Loss 0.08602063357830048\nEpoch 9: Loss 0.07209811359643936",

    "text": "24.1 Converting Words to Numbers (Embeddings)\nThe ability to understand and generate human language has long been considered a hallmark of intelligence. When Alan Turing proposed his famous test in 1950, he chose natural conversation as the ultimate benchmark for machine intelligence. Yet for decades, this goal remained frustratingly elusive. Early attempts at machine translation in the 1950s, which simply replaced words using bilingual dictionaries, produced nonsensical results that highlighted the profound complexity of human language. The phrase “The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak” allegedly translated to Russian and back as “The vodka is good, but the meat is rotten”—a cautionary tale about the subtleties of meaning that transcend mere word substitution.\nThis chapter traces the remarkable journey from those early failures to today’s language models that can engage in nuanced dialogue, translate between languages with near-human accuracy, and even generate creative text. At the heart of this transformation lies a fundamental shift in how we represent language computationally: from discrete symbols manipulated by hand-crafted rules to continuous vector spaces learned from vast corpora of text.\nLanguage presents unique challenges for mathematical modeling. Unlike images, which naturally exist as arrays of continuous pixel values, or audio signals, which are continuous waveforms, text consists of discrete symbols with no inherent geometric structure. The word “cat” is not inherently closer to “dog” than to “quantum”—at least not in any obvious mathematical sense. Yet humans effortlessly recognize that cats and dogs share semantic properties that neither shares with abstract physics concepts.\nA naive way to represent words is through one-hot encoding, where each word in a vocabulary is assigned a unique vector with a single non-zero entry. For example, in a vocabulary of size \\(|V|\\), the word “cat” might be represented as \\[\nv_{\\text{cat}} = \\overbrace{[0, 0, \\ldots, 1, \\ldots, 0]}^{|V|}\n\\] with the 1 in the \\(i\\)-th position corresponding to “cat”. However, this approach fails to capture any notion of semantic similarity: the cosine similarity between any two distinct one-hot vectors is zero, erasing all information about how words relate to each other.\nThis type of representation makes even the seemingly simple task of determining whether two sentences have similar meanings challenging. The sentences “The cat sat on the mat” and “A feline rested on the rug” express nearly identical ideas despite sharing no words except “the” and “on.” Conversely, “The bank is closed” could refer to a financial institution or a river’s edge—the same words encoding entirely different meanings. These examples illustrate why early symbolic approaches to natural language processing, based on logical rules and hand-crafted features, struggled to capture the fluid, contextual nature of meaning.\nThe breakthrough came from reconceptualizing the representation problem. Instead of treating words as atomic symbols, what if we could embed them in a continuous vector space where geometric relationships encode semantic relationships? This idea, simple in retrospect, revolutionized the field. In such a space, we might find that \\(v_{\\text{cat}} - v_{\\text{dog}}\\) has similar direction to \\(v_{\\text{car}} - v_{\\text{bicycle}}\\), capturing the analogical relationship “cat is to dog as car is to bicycle” through vector arithmetic.\nTo formalize this intuition, we seek a mapping \\(\\phi: \\mathcal{V} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^d\\) from a vocabulary \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) of discrete tokens to \\(d\\)-dimensional vectors. The challenge lies in learning this mapping such that the resulting geometry reflects semantic relationships. The naive approach of one-hot encoding, where each word is represented by a vector with a single non-zero entry, fails catastrophically: in an \\(N\\)-word vocabulary, this produces \\(N\\)-dimensional vectors where every pair of distinct words has cosine similarity zero, erasing all notion of semantic relatedness.",

    "text": "The Math of Twenty Questions\nMy (Vadim’s) daughter and I play a game of Twenty Questions during road trips. The rules are simple: one person thinks of something, and the other person has to guess what it is by asking yes-or-no questions. The person who is guessing can ask up to twenty questions, and then they have to make a guess. If they guess correctly, they win; if not, the other person wins. The game is fun, but it’s also a great way to illustrate how AI systems can learn to represent words and phrases as numbers. The trick is to come up with an optimal set of yes-or-no questions that will allow you to distinguish between all the words or phrases you might want to represent. Surprisingly, most of the words can be identified with a small set of universal questions asked in the same order every time. Usually the person who has a better set of questions wins. For example, you might ask:\n\nIs it an animal? (Yes)\nIs this a domestic animal? (No)\nIs it larger than a human? (Yes)\nDoes it have a long tail? (No)\nIs it a predator? (Yes)\nCan move on two feet? (Yes)\nIs it a bear? (Yes)\n\nThus, if we use a 20-dimensional 0-1 vector to represent the word “bear,” the portion of this vector corresponding to these questions would look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal\nDomestic\nLarger than human\nLong tail\nPredator\nCan move on two feet\n\n\n\n\nBear\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n\n\n\nThis is called a word vector. Specifically, it’s a “binary” or 0/1 vector: 1 means yes, 0 means no. Different words would produce different answers to the same questions, so they would have different word vectors. If we stack all these vectors in a matrix, where each row is a word and each column is a question, we get something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal\nDomestic\nLarger than human\nLong tail\nPredator\nCan move on two feet\n\n\n\n\nBear\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n\n\nDog\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nCat\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n\nThe binary nature of these vectors forces us to choose 1 or 0 for the “Larger than human” question for “Dog.” However, there are some dog breeds that are larger than humans, so this binary representation is not very useful in this case. We can do better by allowing the answers to be numbers between 0 and 1, rather than just 0 or 1. This way, we can represent the fact that some dogs are larger than humans, but most are not. For example, we might answer the question “Is it larger than a human?” with a 0.1 for a dog and a 0.8 for a bear. Some types of bears can be smaller than humans, for example, black bears that live in North America, but most bears are larger than humans.\nUsing this approach, the vectors now become\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal\nDomestic\nLarger than human\nLong tail\nPredator\nCan move on two feet\n\n\n\n\nBear\n1\n0\n0.8\n0\n1\n0.8\n\n\nDog\n1\n1\n0.1\n0.6\n0\n0\n\n\nCat\n1\n0.7\n0.01\n1\n0.6\n0\n\n\n\nAI systems also use non-binary scoring rules to judge a win or loss. For example, if the answer is “bear,” then the score might be 100 points for a correct guess, 90 points for a close guess like “Binturong” or “wolverine,” and 50 points for a distant guess like “eagle.” This way of keeping score matches the real-world design requirements of most NLP systems. For example, if you translate JFK saying “Ich bin ein Berliner” as “I am a German,” you’re wrong, but a lot closer than if you translate it as “I am a cronut.”\nThe process of converting words into numbers is called “embedding.” The resulting vectors are called “word embeddings.” The only part that is left is how to design an algorithm that can find a good set of questions to ask. Usually real-life word embeddings have hundreds of questions, not just twenty. The process of finding these questions is called “training” the model. The goal is to find a set of questions that will allow the model to distinguish between all the words in the vocabulary, and to do so in a way that captures their meanings. However, the algorithms do not have a notion of meaning in the same way that humans do. Instead, they learn by counting word co-location statistics—that is, which words tend to appear with which other words in real sentences written by humans.\nThese co-occurrence statistics serve as surprisingly effective proxies for meaning. For example, consider the question: “Among all sentences containing ‘fries’ and ‘ketchup,’ how frequently does the word ‘bun’ also appear?” This is the kind of query a machine can easily formulate and answer, since it relies on counting rather than true understanding.\nWhile such a specific question may be too limited if you can only ask a few hundred, the underlying idea—using word co-occurrence patterns—is powerful. Word embedding algorithms are built on this principle: they systematically explore which words tend to appear together, and through optimization, learn the most informative “questions” to ask. By repeatedly applying these learned probes, the algorithms construct a vector for each word or phrase, capturing its relationships based on co-occurrence statistics. These word vectors are then organized into a matrix for further use.\nThere are many ways to train word embeddings, but the most common one is to use a neural network. The neural network learns to ask questions that are most useful for distinguishing between different words. It does this by looking at a large number of examples of words and their meanings, and then adjusting the weights of the questions based on how well they perform. One of the first and most popular algorithms for this is called Word2Vec, which was introduced by Mikolov et al. (2013) at Google in 2013.",

    "text": "24.2 Word2Vec and Distributional Semantics\nThe theoretical foundation for learning meaningful word representations comes from the distributional hypothesis, articulated by linguist J.R. Firth in 1957: “You shall know a word by the company it keeps.” This principle suggests that words appearing in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings. If “coffee” and “tea” both frequently appear near words like “drink,” “hot,” “cup,” and “morning,” we can infer their semantic similarity.\nThe word2vec framework, introduced by Mikolov et al. (2013), operationalized this insight through a beautifully simple probabilistic model. The skip-gram variant posits that a word can be used to predict its surrounding context words. Given a corpus of text represented as a sequence of words \\(w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_T\\), the model maximizes the likelihood:\n\\[\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{t=1}^T \\sum_{-m \\leq j \\leq m, j \\neq 0} \\log P(w_{t+j} \\mid w_t)\\]\nwhere \\(m\\) is the context window size. The conditional probability is parameterized using two sets of embeddings: \\(\\mathbf{v}_w\\) for words as centers and \\(\\mathbf{u}_w\\) for words as context:\n\\[P(w_o \\mid w_c) = \\frac{\\exp(\\mathbf{u}_o^T \\mathbf{v}_c)}{\\sum_{w \\in \\mathcal{V}} \\exp(\\mathbf{u}_w^T \\mathbf{v}_c)}\\]\nThis formulation reveals deep connections to the theoretical frameworks discussed in previous chapters. The dot product \\(\\mathbf{u}_o^T \\mathbf{v}_c\\) acts as a compatibility score between center and context words, while the softmax normalization ensures a valid probability distribution. From the perspective of ridge functions, we can view this as learning representations where the function \\(f(w_c, w_o) = \\mathbf{u}_o^T \\mathbf{v}_c\\) captures the log-odds of co-occurrence.",

    "text": "24.3 Word2Vec for War and Peace\nThis analysis showcases the application of Word2Vec on Leo Tolstoy’s “War and Peace,” demonstrating how neural network-based techniques can learn vector representations of words by analyzing their contextual relationships within the text. The model employs the skip-gram algorithm with negative sampling (explained later), a widely used configuration for Word2Vec. We use vector dimensions range of 100, providing a balance between capturing semantic detail and computational efficiency. The context window size is set to 5, and the model is trained over several iterations to ensure convergence.\n\nfrom gensim.models import Word2Vec\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot\n# define training data, read from ../data/warpeace.txt\nwith open('../data/warpeace.txt', 'r') as file:\n    Text = file.read()\nsentences = [s.split() for s in Text.split('.

First, the clustering of military-related terms (soldier, regiment, battle) underscores Word2Vec’s ability to group semantically related words based on their co-occurrence patterns. Additionally, the grouping of words such as “ballroom,” “court,” and “marriage” reflects the novel’s emphasis on aristocratic society and its social hierarchy. The use of PCA for dimensionality reduction effectively preserves meaningful relationships while reducing the original high-dimensional Word2Vec space (100 dimensions) to a two-dimensional representation. Overall, this visualization demonstrates how Word2Vec captures distinct thematic domains, including military, social, and government. Notice that a more abstract concept like peace is surrounded by words from both government (history, power, war) and social domains (family, friendship, marriage,court, ballroom, society), indicating its central role in the narrative but is distant from the military domain, which is more focused on the war aspect of the story.\nThese insights have practical applications in literary analysis, theme extraction, character relationship mapping, historical text understanding, and similarity-based text search and recommendation systems.",

Computing the normalization term in the softmax requires summing over the entire vocabulary—potentially millions of terms—for every gradient update. With large corpora containing billions of words, this quickly becomes intractable.\nNegative sampling transforms the problem from multi-class classification to binary classification. Instead of predicting which word from the entire vocabulary appears in the context, we ask a simpler question: given a word pair, is it a real center-context pair from the corpus or a randomly generated negative example? The objective becomes:\n\\[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{NS}} = \\log \\sigma(\\mathbf{u}_o^T \\mathbf{v}_c) + \\sum_{k=1}^K \\mathbb{E}_{w_k \\sim P_n} \\left[\\log \\sigma(-\\mathbf{u}_{w_k}^T \\mathbf{v}_c)\\right]\\]\nwhere \\(\\sigma(x) = 1/(1 + e^{-x})\\) is the sigmoid function, and \\(P_n\\) is a noise distribution over words. The clever insight is that by carefully choosing the noise distribution—typically \\(P_n(w) \\propto f(w)^{3/4}\\) where \\(f(w)\\) is word frequency—we can approximate the original objective while reducing computation from \\(O(|\\mathcal{V}|)\\) to \\(O(K)\\), where \\(K \\ll |\\mathcal{V}|\\) is a small number of negative samples (typically 5-20).\nAn alternative solution is hierarchical softmax, which replaces the flat softmax over the vocabulary with a binary tree where each leaf represents a word. The probability of a word is then the product of binary decisions along the path from root to leaf:\n\\[P(w_o \\mid w_c) = \\prod_{j=1}^{L(w_o)-1} \\sigma\\left([\\![n(w_o, j+1) = \\text{leftChild}(n(w_o, j))]\\!] \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_{n(w_o,j)}^T \\mathbf{v}_c\\right)\\]\nwhere \\(L(w_o)\\) is the length of the path to word \\(w_o\\), \\(n(w_o, j)\\) is the \\(j\\)-th node on this path, and \\([\\![\\cdot]\\!]\\) is the indicator function that returns 1 or -1. This reduces computational complexity from \\(O(|\\mathcal{V}|)\\) to \\(O(\\log |\\mathcal{V}|)\\), though negative sampling typically performs better in practice.",

    "text": "24.5 Global Vectors and Matrix Factorization\nWhile word2vec learns from local context windows, GloVe (Global Vectors) leverages global co-occurrence statistics. The key observation is that the ratio of co-occurrence probabilities can encode semantic relationships. Consider the words “ice” and “steam” in relation to “solid” and “gas”: \\(P(\\text{solid} \\mid \\text{ice}) / P(\\text{solid} \\mid \\text{steam})\\) is large (around 8.9), while \\(P(\\text{gas} \\mid \\text{ice}) / P(\\text{gas} \\mid \\text{steam})\\) is small (around 0.085), and \\(P(\\text{water} \\mid \\text{ice}) / P(\\text{water} \\mid \\text{steam})\\) is close to 1 (around 1.36).\nThese ratios capture the semantic relationships: ice is solid, steam is gas, and both relate to water. GloVe learns embeddings that preserve these ratios through the objective:\n\\[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{GloVe}} = \\sum_{i,j} h(X_{ij}) \\left(\\mathbf{v}_i^T \\mathbf{u}_j + b_i + c_j - \\log X_{ij}\\right)^2\\]\nwhere \\(X_{ij}\\) counts co-occurrences, \\(h(\\cdot)\\) is a weighting function that prevents very common or very rare pairs from dominating, and \\(b_i, c_j\\) are bias terms.

    "text": "24.6 Beyond Words: Subword and Character Models (Tokenization)\nA fundamental limitation of word-level embeddings is their inability to handle out-of-vocabulary words or capture morphological relationships. The word “unhappiness” shares obvious morphological connections with “happy,” “unhappy,” and “happiness,” but word2vec treats these as completely independent tokens.\nFastText addresses this limitation by representing words as bags of character n-grams. For the word “where” with n-grams of length 3 to 6, we extract: “&lt;wh”, “whe”, “her”, “ere”, “re&gt;”, and longer n-grams up to the full word. The word embedding is then the sum of its n-gram embeddings:\n\\[\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{where}} = \\sum_{g \\in \\mathcal{G}_{\\text{where}}} \\mathbf{z}_g\\]\nThis approach naturally handles out-of-vocabulary words by breaking them into known n-grams and provides better representations for rare words by sharing parameters across morphologically related words.\nAn even more flexible approach is Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which learns a vocabulary of subword units directly from the data. Starting with individual characters, BPE iteratively merges the most frequent pair of adjacent units until reaching a desired vocabulary size. For example, given a corpus with word frequencies {“fast”: 4, “faster”: 3, “tall”: 5, “taller”: 4}, BPE might learn merges like “t” + “a” \\(\\rightarrow\\) “ta”, then “ta” + “l” \\(\\rightarrow\\) “tal”, and so on. This data-driven approach balances vocabulary size with representation power, enabling models to handle arbitrary text while maintaining reasonable computational requirements.\nThe choice of tokenization strategy has profound implications for model performance and behavior. Modern LLMs typically use vocabularies of 50,000 to 100,000 tokens, carefully balanced to represent different languages while maintaining computational efficiency. A vocabulary that’s too small forces the model to represent complex concepts with many tokens, making it harder to capture meaning efficiently.\nConsider how the sentence “The Verbasizer helped Bowie create unexpected word combinations” might be tokenized by a BPE-based system. Rather than treating each word as a single unit, the tokenizer might split it into subword pieces like [“The”, ” Ver”, “bas”, “izer”, ” helped”, ” Bow”, “ie”, ” create”, ” unexpected”, ” word”, ” combinations”]. This fragmentation allows the model to handle rare words and proper names by breaking them into more common subcomponents.\nThis tokenization process explains some behavioral patterns in modern language models. Names from fictional universes, specialized terminology, and code snippets can be tokenized in ways that fragment their semantic meaning, potentially affecting model performance on these inputs. Understanding these tokenization effects is crucial for interpreting model behavior and designing effective prompting strategies.",

    "section": "24.7 Attention Mechanisms and Contextual Representations",
    "text": "24.7 Attention Mechanisms and Contextual Representations\nStatic word embeddings suffer from a fundamental limitation: they assign a single vector to each word, ignoring context. The word “bank” receives the same representation whether it appears in “river bank” or “investment bank.” This conflation of multiple senses into a single vector creates an information bottleneck that limits performance on downstream tasks.\nThe evolution of word embeddings culminated in the development of contextual representations, which dynamically adjust based on surrounding context. The context problem was solved by the introduction of attention mechanisms, particularly in the transformer architecture, which allows models to capture complex dependencies and relationships between words. The idea is to mimic the human ability to selectively focus attention. When reading this sentence, your visual system processes every word simultaneously, yet your conscious attention flows sequentially from word to word. You can redirect this attention at will—perhaps noticing a particular phrase or jumping back to reread a complex clause. This dynamic allocation of cognitive resources allows us to extract meaning from information-rich environments without being overwhelmed by irrelevant details.\nMachine learning systems faced analogous challenges in processing sequential information. Early neural networks, particularly recurrent architectures, processed sequences step by step, maintaining a hidden state that theoretically encoded all previous information. However, this sequential bottleneck created fundamental limitations: information from early time steps could vanish as sequences grew longer, and the inherently sequential nature prevented parallel computation that could leverage modern hardware effectively.\nThe attention Vaswani et al. (2023) mechanism revolutionized this landscape by allowing models to directly access and combine information from any part of the input sequence. Rather than compressing an entire sequence into a fixed-size vector, attention mechanisms create dynamic representations that adaptively weight different parts of the input based on their relevance to the current computation. This breakthrough enabled the development of the Transformer architecture, which forms the foundation of modern language models from BERT to GPT.\nAt its core, attention implements an information retrieval system inspired by database operations. Consider how you might search through a library: you formulate a query (what you’re looking for), examine the keys (catalog entries or book titles), and retrieve the associated values (the actual books or their contents). Attention mechanisms formalize this intuition through three learned representations:\n\nQueries (\\(\\mathbf{Q}\\)): What information are we seeking?\nKeys (\\(\\mathbf{K}\\)): What information is available at each position?\nValues (\\(\\mathbf{V}\\)): What information should we retrieve?\n\nGiven a set of keys and values, attention computes a weighted sum of the values based on their relevance to the query. Mathematically, this can be expressed as: \\[\n\\textrm{Attention}(\\mathbf{q}) \\stackrel{\\textrm{def}}{=} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\alpha_i(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{k}_i) \\mathbf{v}_i,\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha_i\\) are scalar attention weights computed from the queries and keys. The operation itself is typically referred to as attention pooling. The name “attention” derives from the fact that the operation pays particular attention to the terms for which the weight \\(\\alpha_i\\) is significant (i.e., large).\nIt is typical in AI applications to assume that the attention weights \\(\\alpha_i\\) are nonnegative and form a convex combination, i.e., \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i = 1\\). A common strategy for ensuring that the weights sum up to 1 is to normalize them via: \\[\n\\alpha_i = \\frac{\\exp(\\alpha_i)}{\\sum_{j=1}^n \\exp(\\alpha_j)}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n    %% Keys column\n    k1[\"k₁\"] \n    k2[\"k₂\"]\n    km[\"kₘ\"]\n    \n    %% Attention weights (functions)\n    alpha1[\"α(q, k₁)\"]\n    alpha2[\"α(q, k₂)\"]\n    alpham[\"α(q, kₘ)\"]\n    \n    %% Query\n    q[\"q\"]\n    \n    %% Values column\n    v1[\"v₁\"]\n    v2[\"v₂\"]\n    vm[\"vₘ\"]\n    \n    %% Output\n    output[\" Sum \"]\n    \n    %% Connections from keys to attention weights\n    k1 --&gt; alpha1\n    k2 --&gt; alpha2\n    km --&gt; alpham\n    \n    %% Query to attention weights\n    q --&gt; alpha1\n    q --&gt; alpha2\n    q --&gt; alpham\n    \n    %% Attention weights to values (dashed lines)\n    alpha1 -.-&gt; v1\n    alpha2 -.-&gt; v2\n    alpham -.-&gt; vm\n    \n    %% Values to output\n    v1 --&gt; output\n    v2 --&gt; output\n    vm --&gt; output",

    "text": "24.9 Cross-attention for Translation\nIn the context of sequence-to-sequence models, one of the key challenges is effectively aligning words and phrases between the source and target languages. This alignment is crucial for ensuring that the translated output maintains the intended meaning and grammatical structure of the original text. Cross-attention mechanisms address this problem by allowing the model to focus on relevant parts of the source sequence when generating each word in the target sequence. This selective focus helps in capturing the nuances of translation, such as word order differences and syntactic variations, which are common in multilingual contexts.\nThe sequence-to-sequence is probably the most commonly used application of language models. Examples include machine translation, text summarization, and text generation from a prompt, question-answering, and chatbots.\nConsider a problem of translating ``The cat sleeps’’ into French. The encoder will produce a sequence of embeddings for the source sentence, and the decoder will produce a sequence of embeddings for the target sentence. The cross-attention mechanism will use English embeddings as keys and values, and French embeddings as queries. The attention weights will be calculated as shown in Figure 24.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24.1: Cross-attention matrix for the translation of “The cat sleeps” into French\n\n\n\nThe rows are queries, and are represented by the French decoder tokens [“Le”, “chat”, “dort”].

    "section": "24.10 Transformer Architecture",
    "text": "24.10 Transformer Architecture\nThe Transformer represents a fundamental shift in how we approach neural network architectures for sequential data. Introduced in the seminal paper “Attention is All You Need” by Vaswani et al. (2023) in 2017, the Transformer has since become the backbone of virtually every state-of-the-art language model, from OpenAI’s GPT series to Google’s Gemini and Meta’s Llama. Beyond text generation, Transformers have proven remarkably versatile, finding applications in audio generation, image recognition, protein structure prediction, and even game playing.\nAt its core, text-generative Transformer models operate on a deceptively simple principle: next-word prediction. Given a text prompt from the user, the model’s fundamental task is to determine the most probable next word that should follow the input. This seemingly straightforward objective, when scaled to billions of parameters and trained on vast text corpora, gives rise to emergent capabilities that often surprise even their creators.\nThe first step in the Transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which allows them to process entire sequences simultaneously rather than sequentially. This parallel processing capability not only enables more efficient training on modern hardware but also allows the model to capture long-range dependencies more effectively than previous architectures like recurrent neural networks.\nWhile modern language models like GPT-4 contain hundreds of billions of parameters, the fundamental architectural principles can be understood through smaller models like GPT-2. The GPT-2 small model, with its 124 million parameters, shares the same core components and principles found in today’s most powerful models, making it an ideal vehicle for understanding the underlying mechanics.\nThe figure below shows the schematic representation of a tranformer architecture.\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR\n    A[Input text] --&gt; T[Tokenizer]\n    T --&gt; B[Embedding &lt;br&gt; Layer]\n    B --&gt; P[Positional &lt;br&gt; Encoding]\n    P --&gt; C1[Self-Attention]\n    P --&gt; C2[Self-Attention]\n    P --&gt; C3[Self-Attention]\n    C1 --&gt; M1[Multi-Layer&lt;br&gt;Perceptron]\n    C2 --&gt; M2[Multi-Layer&lt;br&gt;Perceptron]\n    C3 --&gt; M3[Multi-Layer&lt;br&gt;Perceptron]\n    M1 --&gt; D[Output&lt;br&gt;Probabilities]\n    M2 --&gt; D\n    M3 --&gt; D\n    D --&gt; E[Generated&lt;br&gt;Text]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransformer consists of four fundamental components that work in concert to transform raw text into meaningful predictions. The first step involves converting text to numbers (Tokenizer, Embedding Layer, Positional Encoding). The second step involves the Self-Attention mechanism. The third step involves the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The final step involves the Output Probabilities. We have covered the first two steps in the previous section. Now we will cover the third step, the Multi-Layer Perceptron. Following the attention mechanism, each token’s representation passes through a position-wise feedforward network. The MLP serves a different purpose than attention: while attention routes information between tokens, the MLP transforms each token’s representation independently.\nThe MLP consists of two linear transformations with a GELU activation function:\n\\[\\text{MLP}(x) = \\text{GELU}(xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2\\]\nThe first transformation expands the dimensionality, allowing the model to use a higher-dimensional space for computation before projecting back to the original size. This expansion provides the representational capacity needed for complex transformations while maintaining consistent dimensions across layers.\nAfter processing through all Transformer blocks, the final step converts the rich contextual representations back into predictions over the vocabulary. This involves two key operations. First, The final layer representations are projected into vocabulary space using a linear transformation:\n\\[\\text{logits} = \\text{final\\_representations} \\cdot W_{\\text{output}} + b_{\\text{output}}\\]\nThis produces a vector of \\(|V|\\) values (one for each token in the vocabulary) called logits, representing the model’s raw preferences for each possible next token.\nThe logits are converted into a probability distribution using the softmax function:\n\\[P(\\text{token}_i) = \\frac{\\exp(\\text{logit}_i)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{|\\mathcal{V}|} \\exp(\\text{logit}_j)}\\]\nThis creates a valid probability distribution where all values sum to 1, allowing us to sample the next token based on the model’s learned preferences.\nWhile the three main components form the core of the Transformer, several additional mechanisms enhance stability and performance:\nLayer Normalization\nApplied twice in each Transformer block (before attention and before the MLP), layer normalization stabilizes training by normalizing activations across the feature dimension:\n\\[\\text{LayerNorm}(x) = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\odot \\gamma + \\beta\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are the mean and standard deviation computed across the feature dimension, and \\(\\gamma\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are learned scaling and shifting parameters.\nResidual Connections\nResidual connections create shortcuts that allow gradients to flow directly through the network during training:\n\\[\\text{output} = \\text{LayerNorm}(x + \\text{Sublayer}(x))\\]\nThese connections are crucial for training deep networks, preventing the vanishing gradient problem that would otherwise make it difficult to update parameters in early layers.\nDropout\nDuring training, dropout randomly zeros out a fraction of neuron activations, preventing overfitting and encouraging the model to learn more robust representations. Dropout is typically disabled during inference.\n\nComputational Complexity and Scalability\nThe Transformer architecture’s quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length (\\(O(n^2)\\) for self-attention) has motivated numerous efficiency improvements. However, this complexity enables the model’s remarkable ability to capture long-range dependencies that simpler architectures cannot handle effectively.\nModern implementations leverage optimizations like: - Gradient checkpointing to trade computation for memory - Mixed precision training using 16-bit floating point - Efficient attention implementations that minimize memory usage\nThe Transformer’s success stems from its elegant balance of expressivity and computational efficiency. By enabling parallel processing while maintaining the ability to model complex dependencies, it has become the foundation for the current generation of large language models that are reshaping our interaction with artificial intelligence.\nThe complete Transformer architecture consists of two main components working in harmony. The encoder stack processes input sequences through multiple layers of multi-head self-attention and position-wise feedforward networks, enhanced with residual connections and layer normalization that help stabilize training. The decoder stack uses masked multi-head self-attention to prevent the model from “cheating” by looking at future tokens during training.\nThis architecture enabled the development of three distinct families of models, each optimized for different types of tasks. Encoder-only models like BERT excel at understanding tasks such as classification, question answering, and sentiment analysis. They can see the entire input at once, making them particularly good at tasks where understanding context from both directions matters.\nDecoder-only models like GPT are particularly good at generation tasks, producing coherent, contextually appropriate text. These models are trained to predict the next token given all the previous tokens in a sequence, which might seem simple but turns out to be incredibly powerful for natural text generation.\nEncoder-decoder models like T5 bridge both worlds, excelling at sequence-to-sequence tasks like translation and summarization. The text-to-text approach treats all tasks as text generation problems. Need to translate from English to French? The model learns to generate French text given English input. Want to answer a question? The model generates an answer given a question and context.",

    "text": "24.11 Pretraining at Scale: BERT and Beyond\nBERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a groundbreaking model in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Developed by Google, BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations of words by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. This approach allows BERT to capture the context of a word based on its surrounding words, making it highly effective for understanding the nuances of language.\nThe model’s architecture consists of multiple layers of bidirectional transformers, which allow it to learn complex patterns and relationships in text. BERT’s pretraining involves two main tasks: Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP). In MLM, some percentage of the input tokens are masked at random, and the model learns to predict these masked tokens. NSP involves predicting whether a given pair of sentences are consecutive in the original text.\nBERT’s ability to be fine-tuned for specific tasks with relatively small amounts of data has made it a versatile and powerful tool in the NLP toolkit, leading to significant improvements in performance across a wide range of applications.\nThe availability of powerful architectures raised a crucial question: how can we best leverage unlabeled text to learn general-purpose representations? BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) introduced a pretraining framework that has become the foundation for modern NLP.\nBERT’s key innovation was masked language modeling (MLM), where 15% of tokens are selected for prediction. For each selected token, 80% are replaced with [MASK], 10% with random tokens, and 10% left unchanged. This prevents the model from simply learning to copy tokens when they’re not masked. The loss function only considers predictions for masked positions:\n\\[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{MLM}} = -\\sum_{m \\in \\mathcal{M}} \\log P(x_m \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{\\backslash \\mathcal{M}})\\]\nBERT combines MLM with next sentence prediction (NSP), which trains the model to understand relationships between sentence pairs. Training examples contain 50% consecutive sentences and 50% randomly paired sentences. The input representation concatenates both sentences with special tokens and segment embeddings to distinguish between them.\nThe scale of BERT pretraining represents a quantum leap from earlier approaches. The original BERT models were trained on a combination of BookCorpus (800 million words from over 11,000 books) and English Wikipedia (2,500 million words). This massive dataset enables the model to see diverse writing styles, topics, and linguistic phenomena. The preprocessing pipeline removes duplicate paragraphs, filters very short or very long sentences, and maintains document boundaries to ensure coherent sentence pairs for NSP.\n\nBERT Architecture and Training Details\nTo understand BERT’s architectural significance, it’s helpful to compare it with its predecessors ELMo and GPT, which represent different approaches to contextual representation learning:\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph TB\n    subgraph col1 [\" \"]\n        subgraph ELMo [\"ELMo\"]\n            direction TB\n            E1[\"BiLSTM&lt;br/&gt;Layer 1\"]\n            E2[\"BiLSTM&lt;br/&gt;Layer 2\"]\n            E3[\"Task-specific&lt;br/&gt;Architecture\"]\n            E4[\"Output\"]\n            \n            E1 --&gt; E2\n            E2 --&gt; E3\n            E3 --&gt; E4\n        end\n        \n        style E1 fill:#ffcccc,stroke:#cc0000,stroke-width:2px\n        style E2 fill:#ffcccc,stroke:#cc0000,stroke-width:2px\n        style E3 fill:#ccffcc,stroke:#00cc00,stroke-width:2px\n        style E4 fill:#ccccff,stroke:#0000cc,stroke-width:2px\n    end\n    \n    subgraph col2 [\" \"]\n        subgraph GPT [\"GPT\"]\n            direction TB\n            G1[\"Transformer&lt;br/&gt;Layer 1\"]\n            G2[\"Transformer&lt;br/&gt;Layer 2\"]\n            G3[\"Transformer&lt;br/&gt;Layer 3\"]\n            G4[\"Linear&lt;br/&gt;Output\"]\n            G5[\"Output\"]\n            \n            G1 --&gt; G2\n            G2 --&gt; G3\n            G3 --&gt; G4\n            G4 --&gt; G5\n        end\n        \n        style G1 fill:#ffcccc,stroke:#cc0000,stroke-width:2px\n        style G2 fill:#ffcccc,stroke:#cc0000,stroke-width:2px\n        style G3 fill:#ffcccc,stroke:#cc0000,stroke-width:2px\n        style G4 fill:#ccffcc,stroke:#00cc00,stroke-width:2px\n        style G5 fill:#ccccff,stroke:#0000cc,stroke-width:2px\n    end\n    \n    subgraph col3 [\" \"]\n        subgraph BERT [\"BERT\"]\n            direction TB\n            B1[\"Transformer&lt;br/&gt;Encoder 1\"]\n            B2[\"Transformer&lt;br/&gt;Encoder 2\"]\n            B3[\"Transformer&lt;br/&gt;Encoder 3\"]\n            B4[\"Linear&lt;br/&gt;Output\"]\n            B5[\"Output\"]\n            \n            B1 --&gt; B2\n            B2 --&gt; B3\n            B3 --&gt; B4\n            B4 --&gt; B5\n        end\n        \n        style B1 fill:#ffcccc,stroke:#cc0000,stroke-width:2px\n        style B2 fill:#ffcccc,stroke:#cc0000,stroke-width:2px\n        style B3 fill:#ffcccc,stroke:#cc0000,stroke-width:2px\n        style B4 fill:#ccffcc,stroke:#00cc00,stroke-width:2px\n        style B5 fill:#ccccff,stroke:#0000cc,stroke-width:2px\n    end\n    \n    style col1 fill:none,stroke:none\n    style col2 fill:none,stroke:none\n    style col3 fill:none,stroke:none\n\n\n\n\n\n\nELMo uses bidirectional LSTMs with task-specific architectures, requiring custom model design for each application. GPT employs a unidirectional Transformer decoder that processes text left-to-right, making it task-agnostic but unable to see future context. BERT combines the best of both: bidirectional context understanding through Transformer encoders with minimal task-specific modifications (just an output layer). BERT comes in two main configurations that balance model capacity with computational requirements:\n\nBert configurations and parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\nTransformer Layers\nHidden Dimensions\nAttention Heads\nParameters\n\n\n\n\nBERT-Base\n12\n768\n12\n110M\n\n\nBERT-Large\n24\n1024\n16\n340M\n\n\n\nBoth models use a vocabulary of 30,000 WordPiece tokens, learned using a data-driven tokenization algorithm similar to BPE. The maximum sequence length is 512 tokens, though most pretraining uses sequences of 128 tokens to improve efficiency, with only the final 10% of training using full-length sequences.\nThe pretraining procedure involves several techniques to stabilize and accelerate training:\n\nWarm-up Learning Rate: The learning rate increases linearly for the first 10,000 steps to \\(10^{-4}\\), then decreases linearly. This warm-up prevents large gradients early in training when the model is randomly initialized.\nGradient Accumulation: To simulate larger batch sizes on limited hardware, gradients are accumulated over multiple forward passes before updating weights. BERT uses an effective batch size of 256 sequences.\nMixed Precision Training: Using 16-bit floating point for most computations while maintaining 32-bit master weights speeds up training significantly on modern GPUs.\n\n\n\nData Preparation for BERT Pretraining\nThe data preparation pipeline for BERT is surprisingly complex. Starting with raw text, the process involves:\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR\n    A[Raw Text] --&gt; B[Document Segmentation]\n    B --&gt; C[Sentence Segmentation]\n    C --&gt; D[WordPiece Tokenization]\n    D --&gt; E[Creating Training Examples]\n    E --&gt; F[Creating TFRecord Files]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the document segmentation stage, text is split into documents, maintaining natural boundaries. For books, this means chapter boundaries; for Wikipedia, article boundaries. The next stage is sentence segmentation, where each document is split into sentences using heuristic rules. Typically, this involves identifying periods followed by whitespace and capital letters, while accounting for exceptions such as abbreviations.\nFollowing sentence segmentation, the text undergoes WordPiece tokenization. This process uses a learned WordPiece vocabulary to break text into subword units, ensuring that unknown words can be represented as sequences of known subwords. Special handling is applied to mark the beginning of words.\nOnce tokenized, the data is organized into training examples. For each example, a target sequence length is sampled from a geometric distribution to introduce variability. Sentences are packed together until the target length is reached. For the next sentence prediction (NSP) task, half of the examples use the actual next segment, while the other half use a randomly selected segment. Masked language modeling (MLM) is applied by masking 15% of tokens, following the 80/10/10 strategy: 80% of the time the token is replaced with [MASK], 10% with a random token, and 10% left unchanged. Special tokens such as [CLS] at the beginning and [SEP] between segments are added, and segment embeddings are created (0 for the first segment, 1 for the second). Sequences are padded to a fixed length using [PAD] tokens.\nFinally, the prepared examples are serialized into TFRecord files for efficient input/output during training. Examples are grouped by sequence length to minimize the amount of padding required.\nThe democratization of pretraining through libraries like Hugging Face Transformers has made it possible for smaller organizations to leverage these powerful techniques, either by fine-tuning existing models or pretraining specialized models for their domains.",

Fine-tuning typically requires only 2-4 epochs, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning.\nNatural language inference (NLI) determines logical relationships between premise and hypothesis sentences.

    "text": "24.14 Theoretical Perspectives and Future Directions\nThe success of language models connects to several theoretical frameworks. Transformers are universal approximators for sequence-to-sequence functions—given sufficient capacity, they can approximate any continuous function to arbitrary precision. The self-attention mechanism provides an inductive bias well-suited to capturing long-range dependencies.\nDespite having hundreds of millions of parameters, these models generalize remarkably well. This connects to implicit regularization in overparameterized models, where gradient descent dynamics bias toward solutions with good generalization properties. Language models automatically learn hierarchical features: early layers capture syntax and morphology, middle layers semantic relationships, and later layers task-specific abstractions.\nYet significant challenges remain. Models struggle with compositional generalization—understanding “red car” and “blue house” doesn’t guarantee understanding “red house” if that combination is rare in training. Sample efficiency remains poor compared to human learning. A child masters basic grammar from thousands of examples; BERT sees billions. This gap suggests fundamental differences in learning mechanisms.\nInterpretability poses ongoing challenges. While attention visualizations provide some insights, we lack principled methods for understanding distributed representations across hundreds of layers and attention heads.

    "text": "24.15 Natural Language Processing: Applications\nHaving established the theoretical foundations and pretraining methodologies for natural language understanding, we now turn to the practical application of these techniques to solve real-world problems. The power of pretrained representations lies not merely in their mathematical elegance, but in their ability to transfer learned linguistic knowledge to diverse downstream tasks with minimal architectural modifications.\nThe landscape of NLP applications can be broadly categorized into two fundamental types based on their input structure and prediction granularity. Sequence-level tasks operate on entire text sequences, producing a single output per input sequence or sequence pair. These include sentiment classification, where we determine the emotional polarity of a review, and natural language inference, where we assess logical relationships between premise-hypothesis pairs. Token-level tasks make predictions for individual tokens within sequences, such as named entity recognition that identifies person names, locations, and organizations, or question answering that pinpoints answer spans within passages.\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph TB\n    subgraph \"Pretrained Representations\" [\"Pretrained Text Representations\"]\n        P1[Word2Vec/GloVe] \n        P2[BERT/RoBERTa]\n        P3[GPT/T5]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph \"Deep Learning Architectures\" [\"Model Architectures\"]\n        A1[MLPs]\n        A2[CNNs] \n        A3[RNNs]\n        A4[Transformers]\n        A5[Attention Mechanisms]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph \"Sequence-Level Tasks\" [\"Sequence-Level Applications\"]\n        S1[Sentiment Analysis]\n        S2[Text Classification]\n        S3[Natural Language Inference]\n        S4[Semantic Similarity]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph \"Token-Level Tasks\" [\"Token-Level Applications\"]\n        T1[Named Entity Recognition]\n        T2[Part-of-Speech Tagging]\n        T3[Question Answering]\n        T4[Text Summarization]\n    end\n    \n    P1 --&gt; A1\n    P1 --&gt; A2\n    P1 --&gt; A3\n    P2 --&gt; A4\n    P2 --&gt; A5\n    P3 --&gt; A4\n    \n    A1 --&gt; S1\n    A1 --&gt; S3\n    A2 --&gt; S1\n    A2 --&gt; S2\n    A3 --&gt; S1\n    A3 --&gt; S3\n    A4 --&gt; S2\n    A4 --&gt; S3\n    A4 --&gt; T1\n    A4 --&gt; T3\n    A5 --&gt; S3\n    A5 --&gt; T3\n    \n    style P1 fill:#e8f4f8\n    style P2 fill:#e8f4f8\n    style P3 fill:#e8f4f8\n    style A1 fill:#f0f8e8\n    style A2 fill:#f0f8e8\n    style A3 fill:#f0f8e8\n    style A4 fill:#f0f8e8\n    style A5 fill:#f0f8e8\n    style S1 fill:#fdf2e8\n    style S2 fill:#fdf2e8\n    style S3 fill:#fdf2e8\n    style S4 fill:#fdf2e8\n    style T1 fill:#f8e8f4\n    style T2 fill:#f8e8f4\n    style T3 fill:#f8e8f4\n    style T4 fill:#f8e8f4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis architectural flexibility represents one of the most significant advantages of the representation learning paradigm. Unlike earlier rule-based or feature-engineering approaches that required domain-specific expertise for each task, modern NLP systems can leverage the same pretrained representations across vastly different applications. A BERT model pretrained on general text can be fine-tuned for medical document classification, legal contract analysis, or social media sentiment detection with only task-specific output layers.\n\nSentiment Analysis: From Opinions to Insights\nSentiment analysis exemplifies the practical value of learned text representations. Consider the challenge of processing customer reviews for a major e-commerce platform. Traditional approaches might rely on hand-crafted lexicons of positive and negative words, but such methods fail to capture context-dependent sentiment. The phrase “not bad” expresses mild approval despite containing the negative word “bad,” while “insanely good” uses typically negative intensity (“insanely”) to convey strong positive sentiment.\nModern sentiment analysis systems leverage pretrained embeddings that capture these nuanced semantic relationships. A convolutional neural network architecture can effectively identify local sentiment-bearing phrases through learned filters, while recurrent networks model the sequential dependencies that determine how sentiment evolves throughout a text. The Stanford Sentiment Treebank, with its fine-grained annotations ranging from very negative to very positive, provides a testing ground where contemporary models achieve accuracy levels approaching human inter-annotator agreement.\n\n\nNatural Language Inference: Reasoning About Meaning\nNatural language inference represents a more sophisticated challenge that requires understanding logical relationships between text pairs. Given a premise “The company’s profits increased by 15% this quarter” and a hypothesis “The business is performing well,” a model must determine whether the hypothesis follows from the premise (entailment), contradicts it, or remains neutral.\nThe Stanford Natural Language Inference corpus provides over 570,000 such premise-hypothesis pairs, enabling large-scale training of inference models. Successful approaches often employ attention mechanisms to align relevant portions of premises with hypotheses, identifying which words and phrases support or contradict the proposed logical relationship. The decomposable attention model, for instance, computes element-wise attention between premise and hypothesis tokens, allowing fine-grained comparison of semantic content.\n\n\nToken-Level Applications: Precision at the Word Level\nToken-level tasks require models to make predictions for individual words or subwords within sequences. Named entity recognition illustrates this paradigm: given the sentence “Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs in Cupertino,” a model must identify “Apple Inc.” as an organization, “Steve Jobs” as a person, and “Cupertino” as a location.\nThe BIO (Begin-Inside-Outside) tagging scheme provides a standard framework for such tasks. The word “Apple” receives the tag “B-ORG” (beginning of organization), “Inc.” gets “I-ORG” (inside organization), “Steve” becomes “B-PER” (beginning of person), and so forth. This encoding allows models to handle multi-word entities while maintaining the token-level prediction structure.\nQuestion answering presents another compelling token-level application. In extractive question answering, models must identify spans within passages that answer given questions. The SQuAD dataset poses questions about Wikipedia articles, requiring models to pinpoint exact text spans as answers. For example, given the passage about Apple Inc. and the question “Who founded Apple?”, the model should identify “Steve Jobs” as the answer span.\n\n\nFine-Tuning Pretrained Models\nThe emergence of large-scale pretrained models like BERT has revolutionized the application landscape. Rather than training task-specific models from scratch, practitioners can fine-tune pretrained representations on downstream tasks with remarkable efficiency. This approach typically requires only 2-4 epochs of training on task-specific data, compared to the hundreds of epochs needed for training from random initialization.\nThe fine-tuning process involves freezing most pretrained parameters while allowing task-specific layers to adapt. For sequence classification, this might involve adding a single linear layer on top of BERT’s [CLS] token representation. For token-level tasks like named entity recognition, each token’s representation feeds through the same classification layer to produce per-token predictions.\nThis transfer learning paradigm has democratized access to state-of-the-art NLP capabilities. Organizations without massive computational resources can leverage pretrained models fine-tuned on their specific domains, achieving performance that would have required substantial research and development investments just a few years ago.\n\n\nChallenges and Future Directions\nDespite remarkable progress, significant challenges remain in NLP applications. Models often exhibit brittleness when faced with adversarial examples or distribution shifts between training and deployment data. A sentiment classifier trained on movie reviews might fail on product reviews due to domain-specific language patterns. Similarly, named entity recognition systems trained on news articles may struggle with social media text due to informal language and unconventional capitalization.\nComputational efficiency presents another ongoing concern. While large pretrained models achieve impressive performance, their size and inference requirements limit deployment in resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation and model pruning techniques offer promising approaches for creating smaller, faster models that retain much of the original performance.\nThe interpretability challenge looms large as models become more complex. Understanding why a model makes specific predictions becomes crucial for high-stakes applications like medical diagnosis or legal document analysis. Attention visualizations provide some insight, but we lack comprehensive frameworks for understanding decision-making processes in large neural networks.\nFuture directions point toward multimodal understanding that integrates text with visual and auditory information, few-shot learning that adapts quickly to new domains with minimal examples, and more robust architectures that maintain performance across diverse linguistic contexts. The field continues evolving rapidly, driven by the interplay between theoretical advances in representation learning and practical demands from real-world applications.",

What is the magic behind the curtain that makes a computer suddenly seem to understand the subtleties of human language and thought?\nAt their core, LLMs are powered by the Transformer architecture, which hinges on a concept called attention—the ability to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence to grasp context and meaning. Imagine if you could instantly understand not just what someone is saying, but also catch every subtle reference, every implied connection, every hidden meaning between the lines. This is what attention mechanisms give to artificial intelligence. This chapter will journey from the foundational ideas of attention to the colossal models that are defining our modern world, exploring not just how they work, but how they think.\nThe first application of LLMs that most people encounter is text generation. You provide a prompt, and the model generates a continuation that often feels remarkably coherent and relevant. This ability to produce text that mimics human writing is one of the most striking features of LLMs. But how does it achieve this? And why does it work so well?\nAt its core, an LLM is designed to predict the next token in a sequence based on the context provided by the preceding tokens. This process involves generating a “reasonable continuation” of the input text, where “reasonable” means consistent with patterns observed in vast amounts of human-written text, such as books, articles, and websites. For example, given the prompt “The best thing about AI is its ability to,” the model analyzes patterns from its training data to predict likely continuations. It doesn’t simply match literal text; instead, it evaluates semantic and contextual similarities to produce a ranked list of possible next tokens along with their probabilities.\nThis mechanism allows LLMs to generate text that aligns with human expectations, leveraging their ability to understand context and meaning at a deep level. By iteratively predicting and appending tokens, the model constructs coherent and meaningful responses that often feel indistinguishable from human writing. Let’s see how this works in practice with a simple example using the SmolLM2 model. We’ll start by loading the model and tokenizer, which are essential components for generating text. The tokenizer converts text into tokens that the model can understand, while the model itself generates predictions based on those tokens.\nsys.path.append('./code')\n# Import our custom functions\nfrom llm_chapter import (ask_smol_lm, get_next_word_suggestions, generate_text_step_by_step)\n\nlocal_cache_dir = \"./models_cache\"  # or use absolute path like \"/Users/your_username/ai_models\"\n# Create directory if it doesn't exist\nPath(local_cache_dir).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n# Load model with custom cache directory\nmodel_id = \"HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct\"\n# This will download once and store in your specified directory\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id, cache_dir=local_cache_dir)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id,cache_dir=local_cache_dir,device_map=\"auto\",torch_dtype=torch.float16,low_cpu_mem_usage=True)\ndevice = model.device\nprint(\"Model loaded. Using device:\", device)\n\nModel loaded. Using device: mps:0\nConsider the text “The best thing about AI is its ability to”. Imagine analyzing billions of pages of human-written text—such as those found on the web or in digitized books—and identifying all instances of this text to determine what word most commonly comes next. While an LLM doesn’t directly search for literal matches, it evaluates semantic and contextual similarities to produce a ranked list of possible next words along with their associated probabilities.\n# Get next word suggestions for a given text\ninitial_text = \"The best thing about AI is its ability to\"\nsuggestions = get_next_word_suggestions(initial_text, model, tokenizer, top_k=5)\nprint(f\"Next word suggestions for '{initial_text}':\")\n\nNext word suggestions for 'The best thing about AI is its ability to':\n\nfor i, (word, prob) in enumerate(suggestions):\n    print(f\"  {i+1}. '{word}' (prob: {prob:.3f})\")\n\n  1. ' learn' (prob: 0.623)\n  2. ' help' (prob: 0.119)\n  3. ' augment' (prob: 0.100)\n  4. ' analyze' (prob: 0.084)\n  5. ' process' (prob: 0.074)\nWhen an LLM generates text, it essentially operates by repeatedly asking, “Given the text so far, what should the next word be?”—and then appending a word to the output. More precisely, it adds a “token,” which could represent a full word or just a part of one.\nAt each step, the model produces a ranked list of possible tokens along with their probabilities. One might assume the model should always select the token with the highest probability. However, if this approach is followed strictly, the generated text often lacks creativity and can become repetitive. To address this, randomness is introduced into the selection process. By occasionally choosing lower-ranked tokens, the model can produce more varied and engaging text.\nThis randomness means that using the same prompt multiple times will likely yield different outputs. A parameter called “temperature” controls the degree of randomness in token selection. For text generation tasks, a temperature value of around 0.8 is often found to strike a good balance between coherence and creativity. It’s worth noting that this parameter is based on empirical findings rather than theoretical principles. The term “temperature” originates from statistical physics due to the use of exponential distributions, though its application here is purely mathematical.\nThe following example illustrates the iterative process where the model selects the word with the highest probability at each step:\n# Let's start with a simple prompt\ninitial_text = \"The best thing about AI is its ability to\"\nprint(f\"Initial text: '{initial_text}'\")\n\nInitial text: 'The best thing about AI is its ability to'\n# Generate text step by step\ngenerated_text = generate_text_step_by_step(initial_text, model, tokenizer, num_steps=10, temperature=1.0, sample=False, print_progress=True)\n\nStarting text: 'The best thing about AI is its ability to'\n============================================================\n'The best thing about AI is its ability to learn' (prob: 0.280)\n'The best thing about AI is its ability to learn and' (prob: 0.697)\n'The best thing about AI is its ability to learn and adapt' (prob: 0.481)\n'The best thing about AI is its ability to learn and adapt.'

The model generates text by repeatedly applying this process, building on the context provided by the previous tokens.\nCode\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nsuggestions = get_next_word_suggestions(initial_text, model, tokenizer, top_k=10)\nindices = list(range(len(suggestions)))\nwords = [s[0] for s in suggestions]\nprobabilities = [s[1] for s in suggestions]\n# Plotting the next word suggestions with their log probabilities\nplt.plot(indices, np.log10(probabilities), marker='o', linestyle='-', color='skyblue')\nplt.xticks(indices, words, rotation=45, ha='right')\n\n\n([&lt;matplotlib.axis.XTick object at 0x40c37cef0&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.axis.XTick object at 0x40c37c230&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.axis.XTick object at 0x40c37ce60&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.axis.XTick object at 0x3219beed0&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.axis.XTick object at 0x40c393560&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.axis.XTick object at 0x40c3dc3b0&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.axis.XTick object at 0x40c3dcd40&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.axis.XTick object at 0x40c3dd6a0&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.axis.XTick object at 0x40c3686b0&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.axis.XTick object at 0x40c3ddf10&gt;], [Text(0, 0, ' learn'), Text(1, 0, ' help'), Text(2, 0, ' augment'), Text(3, 0, ' analyze'), Text(4, 0, ' process'), Text(5, 0, ' think'), Text(6, 0, ' enhance'), Text(7, 0, ' automate'), Text(8, 0, ' provide'), Text(9, 0, ' assist')])\n\n\nCode\nplt.xlabel('Next Word Suggestions')\nplt.ylabel('Log Probability')\nplt.title('Next Word Suggestions with Log Probabilities')\nplt.grid()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\nThe plot above shows the next word suggestions generated by the model, with their probabilities represented on a logarithmic scale. This visualization helps us understand how the model ranks different words based on their likelihood of being the next token in the sequence. We can see that the probabilities of each next word decay exponentially (outside of the top word ‘learn’). This follows Zipf’s law, observed by natural language researchers in the 1930s, which states that the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. In other words, a few words are used very frequently, while most words are used rarely.\nNow we will run our LLM generation process for longer and sample words with probabilities calculated based on the temperature parameter. We will use a temperature of 0.8, which is often a good choice for generating coherent text without being too repetitive.\n# Fix the seed for reproducibility\ntorch.manual_seed(8);\ngenerated_text = generate_text_step_by_step(initial_text, model, tokenizer, num_steps=60, temperature=0.8, sample=True,print_progress=False)\nprint(\"Generated text:\")\n\nGenerated text:\n\nprint(textwrap.fill(generated_text, width=80))\n\nThe best thing about AI is its ability to learn and improve over time.

We used Lev Tolstoy’s “War and Peace” novel to estimate the, 2-grams, 3-grams, 4-grams, and 5-grams letter frequencies and to generate text based on those models. The results are shown below:\n2-char-gram: ton w mer. y the ly im, in peerthayice waig trr. w tume shanite tem. hanon t at. bulerates, angh, as\n3-char-gram: the ovna gotionviculy on his sly. shoutessixeemy, he thed ashe me deavell itenci, to hor haturs. alm\n4-char-gram: the with ger frence of duke in me, but of little. progomind some later of wantle as the sentroying t\n5-char-gram: the replace, and of the did natasha's attacket, and aside. he comparte, i complain the old set it, h\nWe used the nltk package (Bird, Klein, and Loper 2009) to estimate the letter frequencies and generate text based on those models. The results show that even with simple letter-based models, we can generate text that resembles the original text, albeit with some nonsensical phrases. This is a good starting point for understanding how LLMs generate text, as they also rely on statistical patterns in the data to generate coherent text.\nHowever, LLMs have much larger context windows, meaning they can consider much longer sequences of text when generating the next token. Modern models such as Gemini 2.5 Pro use context windows of up to 1 million tokens—approximately the size of Leo Tolstoy’s “War and Peace” novel. However, if you try to use a simple counting method (as we did with n-grams), you will quickly run into the problem of combinatorial explosion. For example, if we try to estimate 10-grams letter frequencies, we will have to count 26^10 = 141167095653375 (over 141 trillion) combinations of letters. If we use word-based n-grams, the problem is even worse, as the number of common words in the English language is estimated to be around 40,000. This means that the number of possible 2-grams is 1.6 billion, for 3-grams is 64 trillion, and for 4-grams is 2.6 quadrillion. By the time we get to a typical question people ask when using AI chats with 20 words, the number of possibilities is larger than the number of particles in the universe. The challenge lies in the fact that the total amount of English text ever written is vastly insufficient to accurately estimate these probabilities, and this is where LLMs come in. They use neural networks to “compress” the input context and “interpolate” the probabilities of the next token based on the context. This allows them to estimate probabilities for sequences they have never seen before and generate text that is coherent and contextually relevant. The main component of these neural networks is the transformer architecture.\nThe first step an LLM takes to “compress” the input is applying the attention mechanism. This concept is similar to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used in computer vision, where the model focuses on different parts of the input image. In LLMs, attention allows the model to focus on different parts of the input text when generating the next token.",

    "text": "25.3 The Scale Revolution: How Bigger Became Better\nThe true revolution of large language models came from the discovery that these models exhibit remarkable scaling properties. Unlike many machine learning systems that hit performance plateaus as they grow larger, Transformers demonstrated that their performance scales as a predictable power law with three key factors: the number of model parameters, the amount of training data, and the computational resources used for training.\nThis scaling behavior has led to exponential growth in model sizes. GPT-1, released in 2018 with 117 million parameters, was already considered large for its time. GPT-2, with 1.5 billion parameters, was initially deemed too dangerous to release publicly. GPT-3’s 175 billion parameters represented a quantum leap. Today, we’re seeing models with hundreds of billions to trillions of parameters.\nBut size alone isn’t the only story. The way these models are trained has become increasingly sophisticated. Masked language modeling involves randomly masking tokens in the input and training the model to predict what’s missing. This approach enables bidirectional context understanding, allowing the model to see both what comes before and after a given word when making predictions.\nAutoregressive generation takes a different approach. These models are trained to predict the next token given all the previous tokens in a sequence. This forces the model to learn not just vocabulary and grammar, but also narrative structure, logical reasoning, and even elements of common sense.",

    "text": "25.4 Choosing the Right Model for Your Application\nThe landscape of available LLMs is vast and constantly evolving, making model selection a complex decision. When choosing a model, you need to consider several factors that go beyond just picking the highest-performing option on a benchmark.\nSize tiers offer different trade-offs. Very small models (around 3 billion parameters or less) are fast and efficient, ideal for applications where resources are limited or real-time performance is crucial. These models can run on consumer hardware and often provide adequate performance for simpler tasks like basic text classification.\nMedium-sized models (7 to 30 billion parameters) often represent the sweet spot for many applications. They provide significantly better performance than smaller models while still being manageable in terms of computational requirements. Large models (30 billion parameters or more) provide the best performance and often demonstrate emergent capabilities that smaller models lack, but they require specialized hardware and can be expensive to run.\nBeyond general capability, you need to consider specialized features. Code generation models have been specifically trained on programming languages and software development tasks. They understand the unique challenges of code completion, including the need for “fill-in-the-middle” capabilities rather than just adding to the end of existing code. Multilingual models are designed to work across many languages simultaneously, while domain-specific models have been fine-tuned on specialized corpora.\nPractical constraints often override pure performance considerations. Computational resources, including GPU memory and inference speed, can be limiting factors. Cost considerations vary dramatically between using cloud APIs versus self-hosting models. Latency requirements might favor smaller, faster models over larger, more capable ones. Privacy concerns might necessitate on-premise deployment rather than cloud-based solutions.",

    "text": "25.5 Evaluating Model Performance\nWhen evaluating models, researchers and practitioners rely on various benchmarks that test different aspects of language understanding and generation. The Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark tests knowledge across diverse academic subjects, from high school mathematics to philosophy. HellaSwag evaluates common sense reasoning by asking models to predict likely continuations of scenarios. HumanEval specifically tests code generation capabilities.\nHowever, benchmarks have limitations and don’t always reflect real-world performance. A model that excels at multiple-choice questions might struggle with open-ended creative tasks. Code generation benchmarks might not capture the nuanced requirements of your specific programming domain. The key is to use benchmarks as a starting point while conducting thorough validation using data that closely resembles your actual use case.\nConsider implementing your own evaluation framework that tests the specific capabilities you need. If you’re building a customer service chatbot, create test scenarios that reflect your actual customer interactions. If you’re developing a creative writing assistant, evaluate the model’s ability to generate diverse, engaging content in your target style or genre.",

    "text": "25.6 When Things Go Wrong: Understanding LLM Limitations\nDespite their impressive capabilities, LLMs face several fundamental challenges that become apparent in practical applications. The most widely discussed is the tendency to “hallucinate”—generating confident-sounding but factually incorrect information. This happens because LLMs are fundamentally trained to generate plausible-sounding text, not necessarily true text.\nWhen an LLM encounters a question about a topic it hasn’t seen much during training, it doesn’t simply say “I don’t know.” Instead, it generates text that follows the patterns it has learned, which can result in convincing-sounding but completely fabricated facts, dates, or citations. This limitation is particularly problematic in applications where accuracy is critical.\nBias represents another significant challenge. LLMs can exhibit various biases present in their training data, from subtle gender stereotypes to more overt cultural prejudices. Since these models learn from text produced by humans, they inevitably absorb human biases, sometimes amplifying them in unexpected ways.\nSecurity concerns have emerged as LLMs become more capable. “Jailbreaking” refers to techniques that manipulate models into generating content that violates their safety guidelines. Clever prompt engineering can sometimes bypass safety measures, leading models to provide harmful instructions or exhibit problematic behaviors they were designed to avoid.\nUnderstanding these limitations is crucial for responsible deployment. You need to implement appropriate guardrails, fact-checking mechanisms, and human oversight, especially in high-stakes applications. The goal isn’t to avoid these limitations entirely—that’s currently impossible—but to understand them and design your systems accordingly.",

    "text": "25.7 Building Practical Applications\nModern applications of LLMs extend far beyond simple text generation into sophisticated systems that augment human capabilities. Conversational AI has evolved from simple rule-based chatbots to sophisticated systems capable of maintaining context across long conversations, understanding nuanced requests, and even developing distinct personalities.\nWhen building conversational systems, memory management becomes crucial. LLMs have limited context windows—typically measured in thousands of tokens—so you need strategies for maintaining relevant conversation history while staying within these limits. This might involve summarizing older parts of the conversation, selectively keeping important information, or implementing external memory systems.\nIn content creation applications, LLMs serve as writing assistants that help with everything from grammar and style suggestions to structural improvements and creative ideation. Code generation has become particularly sophisticated, with models capable of writing complete functions, debugging existing code, and generating documentation. These tools work best when they augment rather than replace human expertise.\nAnalysis and understanding applications leverage LLMs’ ability to process and synthesize large amounts of text. Document summarization systems can extract key points from lengthy reports. Sentiment analysis applications help businesses understand customer feedback at scale. Information extraction systems can identify entities, relationships, and key facts from unstructured text.\nAdvanced techniques like prompt engineering have emerged as crucial skills for effectively using LLMs. This involves crafting instructions that guide the model toward desired outputs, often requiring deep understanding of how different phrasings and structures affect model behavior. Few-shot learning allows you to teach models new tasks by providing just a few examples, while chain-of-thought prompting encourages models to break down complex reasoning into step-by-step processes.\nRetrieval-augmented generation represents a particularly promising approach that combines LLMs with external knowledge bases. Instead of relying solely on knowledge encoded in model parameters during training, these systems can dynamically retrieve relevant information from databases, documents, or the internet to inform their responses. This approach helps address the hallucination problem while keeping models up-to-date with current information.",

David Bowie’s experimentation with the “Verbasizer” in the 1990s provides a prescient example of human-AI collaboration in creative work. Bowie created an algorithmic text generator that would help overcome writer’s block by randomly recombining words and phrases from existing text.\nBowie described how this process resulted in a “kaleidoscope of meanings,” with words and ideas colliding in surprising ways. The system would take phrases like “I am a blackstar” and randomly combine them to create new variations that sparked his creative process. The randomness of the algorithm would often produce surprising results that led him in new creative directions, breaking him out of creative ruts and helping him discover unexpected word combinations.\nThis collaborative approach to AI-assisted creativity has become increasingly common in modern creative industries. Musicians use AI tools for melody generation and lyric writing assistance. Writers employ LLMs for brainstorming, overcoming writer’s block, and exploring alternative narrative directions. Visual artists use AI for concept generation and style exploration.\nThe key insight from Bowie’s work—that AI can serve as a creative collaborator rather than just an automation tool—remains relevant as these technologies become more sophisticated. The most successful creative applications of LLMs seem to be those that enhance human creativity rather than attempting to replace it entirely.",

Architectural innovations like Mixture of Experts (MoE) models allow for scaling model capacity without proportionally increasing computational requirements. Multimodal transformers are beginning to bridge the gap between text, images, audio, and other modalities, creating systems that can understand and generate content across multiple forms of media.\nTraining efficiency has become a crucial area of research as models grow ever larger. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques allow practitioners to adapt large models to specific tasks without retraining all parameters. Knowledge distillation enables the creation of smaller, faster models that retain much of the capability of their larger teachers.\nSafety and alignment research has become increasingly important as these models become more capable and widely deployed. Constitutional AI approaches attempt to instill models with explicit principles and values. Human feedback training uses human preferences to fine-tune model behavior, helping ensure that models are helpful, harmless, and honest.\nThe applications continue to expand into new domains. In scientific discovery, LLMs are being used to generate hypotheses, analyze literature, and suggest experimental designs. Educational applications range from personalized tutoring systems to tools that help teachers create customized learning materials. The creative industries are being transformed as artists, writers, and designers incorporate AI tools into their workflows as collaborators that enhance and accelerate the creative process.",

    "text": "25.10 Beyond Next Token Generation\nWhile LLMs excel at predicting the next token in a sequence, their true potential emerges through post-training techniques that teach them to reason, think step-by-step, and align with human expectations. When we think about improving LLMs’ skills, our focus often centers on aspects such as improved grammar or more natural-sounding responses. But what sets a helpful LLM apart is its ability to reason. This involves thinking through problems, breaking them down into steps, making informed decisions, and explaining how it arrived at an answer. Reasoning takes next-token prediction to the next level by adding logic, structure, and goal-oriented thinking.\nWithout strong reasoning skills, models often skip steps, make confident but incorrect claims (hallucinations), or struggle with tasks that require planning or logic. For any organization, this creates a significant risk, undermining user trust and leading to unreliable outcomes. The good news is that we can improve reasoning with the right techniques and upgrade a pre-trained LLM with broad knowledge into a valuable tool for real-world tasks that aligns with users’ needs.\nPost-training refines a model’s capabilities, teaching it to move beyond simply predicting the next word. This means moving past the first plausible answer and compelling the model to build a more deliberate, logical response. It learns to break down a task, reflect on its outputs, and consult external tools—mimicking a more methodical, human-like reasoning process. This is how we upgrade a generalist LLM into a specialized tool that is more accurate, trustworthy, and aligned with specific business goals.",

    "section": "25.11 Post-training Reasoning Techniques",
    "text": "25.11 Post-training Reasoning Techniques\nOne form of reasoning involves combining independent facts to arrive at an answer, rather than simply regurgitating memorized information. For example, when asked, “What is the capital of the state where Dallas is located?” a model could just recall “Austin” if it has seen that exact question before. However, a deeper level of reasoning is at play. Interpretability research reveals that models like Claude first activate concepts representing “Dallas is in Texas” and then connect this to another concept, “the capital of Texas is Austin.” This demonstrates the ability to perform multi-step reasoning by chaining together different pieces of knowledge.\n\n\n\nMulti-step Reasoning: Anthropic\n\n\nThis capability can be tested by intervening in the model’s thought process. For instance, if the “Texas” concept is artificially replaced with “California,” the model’s output correctly changes from “Austin” to “Sacramento,” confirming that it is genuinely using the intermediate step to determine its final answer. This ability to combine facts is a crucial component of advanced reasoning.\nThe landscape of post-training methods used to boost the reasoning abilities of pre-trained LLMs is rich and varied. These techniques build on the model’s existing knowledge, teaching it to follow instructions more effectively and use tools or feedback to refine its answers. Each method adds a new layer of skill, whether it involves breaking down problems, learning from feedback, or drawing on real-world information, all to bridge the model’s reasoning with the human thought process.\nHowever, it’s crucial to understand that even when a model produces a step-by-step “chain of thought,” (CoT) it may not be a faithful representation of its actual reasoning process. Recent research from Anthropic explores this very question, revealing a complex picture: sometimes the reasoning is faithful, and sometimes it’s fabricated to fit a pre-determined conclusion.\nWhen a model is tasked with a problem it can solve, like finding the square root of 0.64, interpretability tools show that it follows a logical path, activating concepts for intermediate steps (like the square root of 64) before reaching the final answer. However, when presented with a difficult problem and an incorrect hint, the model can engage in what researchers call “motivated reasoning.” It starts with the incorrect answer and works backward, creating a believable but entirely fake sequence of steps to justify its conclusion. This ability to generate a plausible argument for a foregone conclusion without regard for truth is a critical limitation. These interpretability techniques offer a way to “catch the model in the act” of faking its reasoning, providing a powerful tool for auditing AI systems.\nLLMs were not originally designed to function as calculators; they were trained on text data and lack built-in mathematical algorithms. Yet, they can perform addition tasks, like calculating 36+59, seemingly without explicitly writing out each step. How does a model, primarily trained to predict the next word in a sequence, manage to perform such calculations?\nOne might speculate that the model has memorized extensive addition tables, allowing it to recall the answer to any sum present in its training data. Alternatively, it could be using traditional longhand addition methods similar to those taught in schools.\nHowever, research reveals that Claude, a specific LLM, utilizes multiple computational strategies simultaneously. One strategy estimates an approximate answer, while another precisely calculates the last digit of the sum. These strategies interact and integrate to produce the final result. While addition is a straightforward task, analyzing how it is executed at this granular level—through a combination of approximate and precise methods—can provide insights into how Claude approaches more complex problems.\n\n\n\nMental Math Problem Solving: Anthropic\n\n\nModels like Claude 3.7 Sonnet can “think out loud,” often improving answer quality, but sometimes misleading with fabricated reasoning. This “faked” reasoning can be convincing, posing reliability challenges. Interpretability helps distinguish genuine reasoning from false.\nFor instance, Claude accurately computes the square root of 0.64, showing a clear thought process. However, when tasked with finding the cosine of a large number, it may fabricate steps. Additionally, when given a hint, Claude may reverse-engineer steps to fit a target, demonstrating motivated reasoning.\n\n\n\nFalse Reasoning: Anthropic\n\n\nThis highlights that a model’s explanation of its thought process can’t always be trusted. For high-stakes applications, being able to verify the internal reasoning process, rather than just accepting the output, is essential for building reliable and trustworthy AI.\nInstruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) represents perhaps the most fundamental approach to improving model reasoning. The core idea involves taking a pre-trained model and running a second pass of supervised learning on mini-lessons, each formed as a triple of instruction, input, and answer.\nConsider a math word problem where the instruction asks to solve this math word problem step by step, the input presents Sarah has 12 apples and gives away 5. How many does she have left?, and the answer provides\nStep 1: Start with 12 apples. \nStep 2: Subtract 5 apples given away. \nStep 3: 12 - 5 = 7 apples remaining. \nEach training example teaches the model how to transform a task description into the steps that solve it (Chung et al. 2022). After thousands of such drills, the model learns many small skills and when to switch among them. The steady practice trains it to deliver precise answers that match the instruction rather than sliding into a generic reply. Empirical evidence demonstrates the power of this approach: Flan UPaLM 540B, a variant of the UPaLM model fine-tuned with instruction-based tasks, significantly outperformed the original UPaLM 540B model. UPaLM stands for Unified Pre-trained Language Model, which is a large-scale language model designed to handle a wide range of tasks. The Flan UPaLM 540B was evaluated across four benchmarks: MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding), which tests the model’s ability to handle a variety of academic subjects; BBH (Big-Bench Hard), a set of challenging tasks designed to push the limits of language models; TyDiQA (Typologically Diverse Question Answering), which assesses the model’s performance in answering questions across diverse languages; and MGSM (Mathematics Grade School Math), which evaluates the model’s capability in solving grade school-level math problems. The Flan UPaLM 540B showed an average improvement of 8.9% over the original model across these benchmarks.\nDomain-Specific Supervised Fine-Tuning takes the IFT principle and applies it within specialized fields. This approach restricts the training corpus to one technical field, such as medicine, law, or finance, saturating the model weights with specialist concepts and rules. Fine-tuning on domain-specific data enables the model to absorb the field’s vocabulary and structural rules, providing it with direct access to specialized concepts that were scarce during pre-training. The model can quickly rule out answers that do not make sense and narrow the search space it explores while reasoning. Mastering a domain requires data that captures its unique complexity, utilizing domain-specific examples, human-labeled edge cases, and diverse training data generated through hybrid pipelines combining human judgment and AI. This process enhances the model’s ability to follow complex instructions, reason across modalities and languages, and avoid common pitfalls like hallucination. The effectiveness of this approach is striking: in ICD-10 coding, domain SFT catapulted exact-code accuracy from less than 1% to approximately 97% on standard ICD coding (including linguistic and lexical variations) and to 69% on real clinical notes (Hou et al. 2025).\n\nChain-of-Thought (CoT)\nChain-of-Thought (Wei et al. 2023) prompting offers a remarkably simple yet powerful technique that requires no model retraining. The approach involves showing the model a worked example that spells out every intermediate step, then asking it to “think step by step.” Writing the solution step by step forces the model to reveal its hidden reasoning, making it more likely for logically necessary tokens to appear. Because each step is generated one at a time, the model can inspect its own progress and fix contradictions on the fly. The empirical results are impressive: giving PaLM 540B eight CoT examples improved its accuracy on GSM8K from 18% to 57%. This improvement came entirely from a better prompt, with no changes to the model’s weights.\n\n\nAdvanced Chain-Based Reasoning\nTree-of-Thought (ToT) extends the chain-of-thought concept by allowing exploration of multiple reasoning paths simultaneously. Instead of following one chain, this method lets the model branch into multiple reasoning paths, score partial solutions, and expand on the ones that look promising. Deliberate exploration stops the first plausible idea from dominating. ToT lets the model test several lines of reasoning instead of locking onto one. When a branch hits a dead end, it can backtrack to an earlier step and try another idea, something a plain CoT cannot do. The model operates in a deliberate loop: propose, evaluate, and explore. This approach resembles a CEO evaluating multiple business strategies, modeling several potential outcomes before committing to the most promising one, preventing over-investment in a flawed initial idea. This principle has been applied in projects to improve coding agents focused on generating pull requests for repository maintenance and bug-fixing tasks across multiple programming languages. Researchers have analyzed thousands of coding agent trajectories, evaluating each interaction step-by-step to provide more explicit guidance to the models, enabling them to make better decisions on real coding tasks. In the “Game of 24” puzzle, GPT-4 combined with CoT reasoning solved only 4% of the puzzles, but replacing it with ToT raised the success rate to 74% (Yao et al. 2023).\nReflexion (Yao et al. 2023) introduces a self-improvement mechanism that operates through iterative feedback. After each attempt, the model writes a short reflection on what went wrong or could be improved. That remark is stored in memory and included in the next prompt, giving the model a chance to revise its approach on the next try. Reflexion turns simple pass/fail signals into meaningful feedback that the model can understand and act on. By reading its own critique before trying again, the model gains short-term memory and avoids repeating past mistakes. This self-monitoring loop of try, reflect, revise guides the model toward better reasoning without changing its weights. Over time, it helps the model adjust its thinking more like a human would, by learning from past mistakes and trying again with a better plan. A GPT-4 agent using Reflexion raised its success rate from 80% to 91% on the HumanEval coding dataset.\n\n\nEstablishing non-linear reasoning capabilities\nRecent advances in LLM reasoning have focused on establishing these non-linear capabilities, moving beyond simple chain-of-thought prompting to more sophisticated reasoning architectures. These approaches recognize that human reasoning is rarely linear—we backtrack when we realize we’ve made an error, we consider multiple possibilities in parallel, and we iteratively refine our understanding as we gather more information.\nOne promising direction is iterative reasoning, where models are allowed to revise their intermediate steps based on feedback or self-evaluation. Unlike traditional autoregressive generation where each token is final once generated, iterative approaches allow the model to revisit and modify earlier parts of its reasoning chain. This might involve generating an initial solution, evaluating it for consistency, and then revising specific steps that appear problematic.\nA compelling example of how extended thinking improves reasoning capabilities can be seen in mathematical problem-solving performance. When Claude 3.7 Sonnet was given more computational budget to “think” through problems on the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) 2024, its accuracy improved logarithmically with the number of thinking tokens allocated. This demonstrates that allowing models more time for internal reasoning—similar to how humans perform better on complex problems when given more time to think—can lead to substantial performance gains.\n\n\n\nAIME 2024 performance vs. actual thinking token usage\n\n\nFigure: Claude 3.7 Sonnet’s performance on the 2024 American Invitational Mathematics Examination improves logarithmically with the number of thinking tokens used per problem. The model generally uses fewer tokens than the maximum budget allocated, suggesting it adaptively determines when sufficient reasoning has been applied. Source: Anthropic’s Visible Extended Thinking\nParallel hypothesis generation represents another departure from linear reasoning. Instead of committing to a single reasoning path, these approaches generate multiple competing explanations or solutions simultaneously. The model can then evaluate these alternatives, potentially combining insights from different paths or selecting the most promising direction based on evidence accumulation.\nDynamic tool selection and reasoning takes this further by allowing models to adaptively choose which reasoning strategies or external tools to employ based on the specific demands of the current problem. Rather than following a predetermined sequence of operations, the model can dynamically decide whether to retrieve external information, perform symbolic computation, or engage in pure logical reasoning based on the current state of the problem.\nThese non-linear reasoning capabilities are particularly important for complex problem-solving scenarios where the optimal approach isn’t clear from the outset. In scientific reasoning, for example, a hypothesis might need to be revised as new evidence emerges. In mathematical problem-solving, an initial approach might prove intractable, requiring a fundamental shift in strategy. In code generation, debugging often requires jumping between different levels of abstraction and considering multiple potential sources of error.\nThe implementation of non-linear reasoning often involves sophisticated orchestration between multiple model calls, external tools, and feedback mechanisms. This represents a shift from viewing LLMs as simple text generators to understanding them as components in more complex reasoning systems. As these capabilities mature, we can expect to see LLMs that not only generate human-like text but also exhibit more human-like reasoning patterns—flexible, adaptive, and capable of handling ambiguity and uncertainty with greater finesse.\n\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses one of the fundamental limitations of LLMs: their reliance on knowledge encoded during training. Before answering, a retriever grabs documents or information relevant to the query and injects them into the context window so the model can reason over fresh evidence. RAG grounds the model in verifiable facts, drastically reducing hallucinations and improving user trust. Instead of relying on potentially outdated or incorrect memorized knowledge, the model reasons over fresh, injected evidence. This approach resembles a lawyer building an argument not from memory, but by citing specific, relevant legal precedents directly in court. The integration of RAG into an enterprise workflow-generation system reduced the rate of hallucinated steps and tables from 21% to 7.5% when evaluated on the HumanEval benchmark (Ayala and Bechard 2024). In real-world applications enhancing LLMs’ multilingual reasoning, RAG has been used to feed models verified, multilingual documents at inference time. The results show that models can answer complex questions in multiple languages, citing specific evidence from retrieved text. Every factual claim becomes traceable, eliminating guesswork and demonstrating a consistent, grounded reasoning process across languages.\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) represents a sophisticated approach to aligning model behavior with human preferences. The process involves taking a pre-trained model and generating several answers for real user prompts. Human reviewers rank those answers, a reward model learns these rankings, and the main model is updated to score higher on that reward. This loop optimizes the model to produce outputs humans prefer rather than those that merely score well on next-token likelihood. Because humans reward answers that are complete, fact-checked, and well-explained, the model learns to value clear logic over quick guesses. Each reinforcement learning step trains it to produce responses that follow instructions, chain ideas coherently, and avoid unsupported claims, aligning its internal decision-making with human expectations. In the original InstructGPT study by Ouyang et al. (2022), annotators preferred answers from the 175B RLHF-tuned model over the same-size GPT-3 baseline 85% of the time. Even the 1.3B RLHF model outperformed the baseline, despite having 100 times fewer parameters.\nChain-of-Action (CoA) (Pan et al. 2025) represents the most sophisticated integration of reasoning and external tool use. This approach decomposes a complex query into a reasoning chain interleaved with tool calls such as web search, database lookup, or image retrieval that are executed on the fly and fed into the next thought. Each action grounds the chain in verified facts. By using up-to-date information and multi-reference faith scores, the model can remain grounded and make more informed decisions, even when sources disagree. Because it can plug in different tools as needed, it’s able to take on more complex tasks that require different data modalities. CoA outperformed the leading CoT and RAG baselines by approximately 6% on multimodal QA benchmarks, particularly on compositional questions that need both retrieval and reasoning.\n\n\nCombining Techniques for Optimal Performance\nEach technique brings its advantages, and the most effective AI systems often combine them strategically. An agent might follow structured prompts through instruction fine-tuning, think through problems step by step using chain-of-thought reasoning, refine its answers through self-review via reflexion, and align its tone based on human feedback through RLHF. This stacked approach has become standard in today’s leading models: most large LLMs, including GPT-4, are first trained with supervised fine-tuning and then polished with RLHF.\nTo understand these approaches systematically, we can think of instruction fine-tuning as teaching with flashcards, learning specific input-output patterns for following user commands. Domain-specific fine-tuning resembles medical school specialization, absorbing field-specific vocabulary and rules for expert knowledge tasks. Chain-of-thought operates like showing your work in math class, generating intermediate reasoning steps for complex problem solving. Tree-of-thought functions as decision tree exploration, branching and evaluating multiple paths for planning and strategy tasks. Reflexion mirrors learning from mistakes through self-critique and improvement for iterative problem solving.

    "text": "25.12 Data quality and quantity\nOne might assume that training an LLM for non-linear reasoning would require tremendous amounts of data, but recent research reveals that data quality can compensate for limited quantity. This finding has significant implications for organizations looking to develop reasoning-capable models without massive data collection efforts.\nTwo compelling examples demonstrate this principle. The S1 research (Yang et al. 2025) fine-tuned their base model, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, on only 1,000 high-quality reasoning examples, yet achieved remarkable performance improvements. Their data collection process was methodical: they started with 59,029 questions from 16 diverse sources (including many Olympiad problems), generated reasoning traces using Google Gemini Flash Thinking API through distillation, then applied rigorous filtering. Problems were first filtered by quality (removing poor formatting), then by difficulty—a problem was deemed difficult if neither Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct nor Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct could solve it, and the reasoning length was substantial. Finally, 1,000 problems were sampled strategically across various topics.\nSimilarly, the LIMO (Less is More for Reasoning) research (Ye et al. 2025) demonstrated that quality trumps quantity. Taking NuminaMath as a base model, they fine-tuned it on merely 817 high-quality curated training samples to achieve impressive mathematical performance with exceptional out-of-distribution generalization. Their results were striking enough to warrant comparison with OpenAI’s o1 model.\nFor high-quality non-linear reasoning data, LIMO proposes three essential guidelines:\nStructured Organization: Tokens are allocated to individual “thoughts” according to their importance and complexity, with more tokens devoted to key reasoning points while keeping simpler steps concise. This mirrors how human experts organize their thinking—spending more time on difficult concepts and moving quickly through routine steps.\nCognitive Scaffolding: Concepts are introduced strategically, with careful bridging of gaps to make complex reasoning more accessible. Rather than jumping directly to advanced concepts, the reasoning process builds understanding step by step, similar to how effective teachers structure lessons.\nRigorous Verification: Intermediate results and assumptions are frequently checked, and logical consistency is ensured throughout the reasoning chain. This is especially important given the risk of hallucinations in complex reasoning tasks.\nThe verification aspect deserves special attention. The rStar-Math research (Guan et al. 2025) offers an innovative approach by training their LLM to produce solutions as Python code with text as code comments. This format allows for automatic verification—the code can be executed to check correctness, providing immediate feedback on the reasoning process. With agentic capabilities, this approach could create a feedback loop where the LLM learns from its execution results.\nThese findings suggest that the path to better reasoning capabilities lies not in simply collecting more data, but in curating datasets that exemplify the structured, scaffolded, and verified thinking patterns we want models to learn. This approach makes advanced reasoning capabilities more accessible to organizations that may not have access to massive datasets but can invest in creating high-quality training examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25.1: An example of Code-augmented CoT Figure from RStar-Math Guan et al. (2025)\n\n\n\nFigure 25.1 shows how rStar-Math integrates code execution with reasoning by formatting solutions as Python code with explanatory comments. This approach allows for automatic verification of intermediate steps, creating a feedback loop where the model can learn from execution results and catch errors in real-time. The figure demonstrates how mathematical reasoning can be made more reliable by grounding abstract concepts in executable code.",

    "text": "26.1 LLM Agents\n“The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim.” — Edsger Dijkstra\nImagine you’re running a global logistics company, coordinating thousands of shipments across continents. Each decision—routing, timing, inventory management—requires processing vast amounts of real-time data, considering countless variables, and adapting to unexpected disruptions. Now imagine having an intelligent assistant that not only processes this information instantaneously but also learns from each decision, communicates with other systems, and autonomously handles routine tasks while escalating complex situations to human experts.\nThis is the promise of AI agents: autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, reason about goals, make decisions, and take actions to achieve desired outcomes. Unlike traditional software that follows predetermined scripts, AI agents exhibit agency—the capacity to act independently and adapt to changing circumstances while pursuing specific objectives.\nThe emergence of large language models has revolutionized the agent landscape. Where earlier agents were confined to narrow domains with hand-crafted rules, modern LLM-powered agents can understand natural language instructions, reason through complex problems, and interact with diverse tools and systems. They represent a fundamental shift from reactive programming to proactive intelligence.\nIn this chapter, we explore the architecture, capabilities, and challenges of contemporary AI agents. We examine how large language models serve as the cognitive core of these systems, investigate orchestration patterns that enable complex multi-agent collaborations, and discuss the critical considerations of evaluation and safety that govern their deployment in real-world applications.\nThe integration of large language models into agent architectures has created a new paradigm in artificial intelligence. Traditional rule-based agents operated within constrained environments with explicitly programmed behaviors. LLM agents, by contrast, leverage the emergent reasoning capabilities of foundation models to interpret instructions, plan actions, and adapt to novel situations.\nAt its core, an LLM agent consists of several interconnected components. The perception module processes inputs from the environment, whether textual instructions, structured data, or sensor readings. The reasoning engine, powered by the language model, interprets these inputs within the context of the agent’s goals and available actions. The memory system maintains both short-term context and long-term knowledge, enabling the agent to learn from experience and maintain coherent behavior across extended interactions.\nConsider a customer service agent powered by an LLM. When a customer describes a billing discrepancy, the agent must understand the natural language description, access relevant account information, reason about company policies, and formulate an appropriate response. This requires not just pattern matching but genuine comprehension and reasoning—capabilities that emerge from the language model’s training on diverse textual data.\nWhile language models excel at reasoning, they are fundamentally like a brain without hands; they cannot directly interact with the external world. The ability to use tools bridges this gap, transforming the LLM from a passive conversationalist into an active participant in digital and physical systems. A tool is simply a function that the agent can call to perform an action, such as retrieving data from a database, calling an external API, running a piece of code, or even controlling a robot.\nThis capability is enabled by a mechanism known as function calling. The agent is first provided with a manifest of available tools, where each tool is described with its name, its purpose, and the parameters it accepts. When the LLM determines that a task requires external action, it produces a structured tool call—a formatted request specifying the function to execute and the arguments to pass to it. An orchestrator outside the LLM receives this request, runs the specified function, and captures the output.\nIn many cases, this output is then fed back to the language model as new information. The LLM can then use this result to formulate its final response to the user. This creates a powerful loop: the agent reasons about a goal, acts by calling a tool, observes the outcome, and then reasons again to produce a final result or plan the next step. For example, if asked about the price of an item in a different currency, an agent might first call a convert_currency tool. After receiving the converted value, it would then generate a natural language sentence incorporating that result, such as, “That would be 25.50 in your local currency.”\nThe planning capabilities of LLM agents extend this tool-use mechanism to handle complex, multi-step goals. Given a high-level objective, the agent can devise a plan consisting of a sequence of tool calls. It executes the first step, observes the outcome, and then uses that result to inform the next step, adjusting its plan as needed. For instance, a financial analysis agent tasked with “analyzing the correlation between interest rates and housing prices” would decompose this into a chain of actions: first calling a tool to retrieve historical interest rate data, then another to get housing prices, and finally a third to perform statistical analysis and synthesize the results into a report. This iterative process allows agents to tackle problems that require gathering and processing information from multiple sources.\nHowever, the autonomy of LLM agents introduces significant challenges. The probabilistic nature of language model outputs creates uncertainty; an agent may produce different and unpredictable actions even with identical inputs, complicating testing and verification. More critically, the ability to act on the world magnifies the risk of hallucinations. A hallucination in a chatbot is a nuisance, but an agent hallucinating a reason to delete a file or execute a harmful financial transaction can have severe consequences. An agent given control over a user’s computer could delete important folders, and a robotic agent could break objects if it misinterprets its instructions or environment.\nReliability mechanisms have emerged to address these challenges. Output validation ensures that agent actions conform to expected formats and constraints. Confidence scoring helps identify uncertain responses that may require human review. Multi-step verification processes cross-check critical decisions against multiple sources or reasoning paths.",

    "text": "26.2 Replit’s AI Agent Wipes Company’s Codebase\nThe theoretical risks of agent autonomy became starkly real in a widely publicized incident involving Replit’s AI agent. A user, attempting to debug their live production application, instructed the agent to help fix a bug. The agent incorrectly diagnosed the problem as stemming from a configuration file. In its attempt to be helpful, it decided to delete the file.\nHowever, the failure cascaded. A bug in the agent’s implementation of the file deletion tool caused the command to malfunction catastrophically. Instead of deleting a single file, the agent executed a command that wiped the entire project, including the production database. The user’s live application was destroyed in an instant by an AI trying to fix a minor bug.\nThis incident serves as a critical lesson in agent safety. It was not a single failure but a chain of them: the agent’s incorrect reasoning, its autonomous decision to perform a destructive action without explicit confirmation, and a flaw in its tool-use capability. It underscores the immense gap between an LLM’s ability to generate plausible-sounding text (or code) and the true contextual understanding required for safe operation. Giving an agent control over production systems requires multiple layers of defense, from sandboxing and permission controls to mandatory human-in-the-loop confirmation for any potentially irreversible action.",

    "text": "26.3 Case Study: Anthropic’s Proactive Safety Measures for Frontier Models\nAs AI models become more capable, the potential for misuse in high-stakes domains like biosecurity becomes a significant concern. In May 2025, Anthropic proactively activated its AI Safety Level 3 (ASL-3) protections for the release of its new model, Claude Opus 4, even before determining that the model definitively met the risk threshold that would require such measures. This decision was driven by the observation that the new model showed significant performance gains on tasks related to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) weapons development, making it prudent to implement heightened safeguards as a precautionary step.\nAnthropic’s ASL-3 standards are designed to make it substantially harder for an attacker to use the model for catastrophic harm. The deployment measures are narrowly focused on preventing the model from assisting with end-to-end CBRN workflows. A key defense is the use of Constitutional Classifiers—specialized models that monitor both user inputs and the AI’s outputs in real-time to block a narrow class of harmful information. These classifiers are trained on a “constitution” defining prohibited, permissible, and borderline uses, making them robust against attempts to “jailbreak” the model into providing dangerous information.\nThis real-time defense is supplemented by several other layers. A bug bounty program incentivizes researchers to discover and report vulnerabilities, and threat intelligence vendors monitor for emerging jailbreak techniques. When a new jailbreak is found, a rapid response protocol allows Anthropic to “patch” the system, often by using an LLM to generate thousands of variations of the attack and then retraining the safety classifiers to recognize and block them.\nOn the security front, the ASL-3 standard focuses on protecting the model’s weights—the core parameters that define its intelligence. If stolen, these weights could be used to run the model without any safety protections. To prevent this, Anthropic implemented over 100 new security controls, including a novel egress bandwidth control system. Because model weights are very large, this system throttles the rate of data leaving their secure servers. Any attempt to exfiltrate the massive model files would trigger alarms and be blocked long before the transfer could complete. Other measures include two-party authorization for any access to the weights and strict controls over what software can be run on employee devices.\nAnthropic’s decision to activate these protections preemptively highlights a maturing approach to AI safety. It acknowledges that as models approach critical capability thresholds, a “better safe than sorry” approach is warranted. By implementing and testing these advanced safeguards before they are strictly necessary, the company can learn from real-world operation, refine its defenses, and stay ahead of emerging threats, all while creating a more secure environment for the deployment of powerful AI.",

    "section": "26.4 Agent Orchestration",
    "text": "26.4 Agent Orchestration\nAgentic workflows unlock advanced capabilities for large language models, transforming them from simple tools into autonomous “workers” that can perform multi-step tasks. In these workflows, an agent interacts with an environment by receiving observations of its state and taking actions that affect it. After each action, the agent receives new observations, which may include state changes and rewards. This structure is reminiscent of Reinforcement Learning (RL), but instead of explicit training, LLMs typically rely on in-context learning, leveraging prior information embedded in prompts to guide their behavior.\nThe ReAct (Reason + Act) framework by Google is an example of an implementation of this agent-environment interaction. An LLM agent operating under ReAct alternates between three stages: observation, reasoning, and action. In the observation stage, the agent analyzes user input, tool outputs, or the environmental state. Next, during the reasoning stage, it decides which tool to use, determines the arguments to provide, or concludes that it can answer independently. Finally, in the action stage, it either invokes a tool or sends a final output to the user. While foundational,\n\nExample 26.1 (Research Study: ChatDev Software Development Framework) ChatDev by Qian et al. (2024) provides a simulated example of a comprehensive framework for automated software development. Unlike traditional approaches that focus on individual coding tasks, ChatDev orchestrates an entire virtual software company through natural language communication between specialized AI agents.\n\n\n\nChatDev workflow. Source: Qian et al. (2024)\n\n\nThe ChatDev framework divides software development into four sequential phases following the waterfall model: design, coding, testing, and documentation. Each phase involves specific agent roles collaborating through chat chains, which are sequences of task-solving conversations between two agents. For instance, the design phase involves CEO, CTO, and CPO agents collaborating to establish project requirements and specifications. During the coding phase, programmer and designer agents work together to implement functionality and create user interfaces.\nA key innovation in ChatDev is its approach to addressing code hallucinations, where LLMs generate incomplete, incorrect, or non-executable code. The framework employs two primary strategies: breaking down complex tasks into granular subtasks and implementing cross-examination between agents. Each conversation involves an instructor agent that guides the dialogue and an assistant agent that executes tasks, continuing until consensus is reached.\nThe experimental evaluation demonstrated impressive results across 70 software development tasks. ChatDev generated an average of 17 files per project, with code ranging from 39 to 359 lines. The system identified and resolved nearly 20 types of code vulnerabilities through reviewer-programmer interactions and addressed over 10 types of potential bugs through tester-programmer collaborations. Development costs averaged just $0.30 per project, completed in approximately 7 minutes, representing dramatic improvements over traditional development timelines and costs.\nHowever, the research also acknowledged significant limitations. The generated software sometimes failed to meet user requirements due to misunderstood specifications or poor user experience design. Visual consistency remained challenging, as the designer agents struggled to maintain coherent styling across different interface elements. Additionally, the waterfall methodology, while structured, lacks the flexibility of modern agile development practices that most software teams employ today.\n\nAs tasks become more complex, a single agent can become bloated and difficult to manage. For instance, an agent designed to navigate a dungeon might need a “main” LLM for environmental interaction, a “planner” LLM for strategy, and a “memory compression” LLM to manage its knowledge. To address this, the workflow can be restructured as a graph where different LLM instances are decoupled into separate agents that share memory or tools.\nSetting up such a system requires careful design choices, including defining agent roles, structuring the workflow, and establishing communication protocols. A key advantage of multi-agent systems is their ability to create a “memory of experience,” where agents contribute to a shared knowledge base, allowing the entire system to “learn” from its past interactions.\nHowever, agentic orchestration is not without its challenges. LLM hallucinations can disrupt complex workflows, and designing a flexible yet manageable orchestration is notoriously difficult. A system that is too rigid becomes an anti-pattern, while one that is too general can become overly complex and unreadable.\nAs individual agents have proven their capabilities in isolated tasks, the next frontier involves orchestrating multiple agents to tackle problems that exceed the scope of any single system. Agent orchestration encompasses the patterns, protocols, and architectures that enable diverse agents to collaborate effectively toward shared objectives.\nThe simplest orchestration pattern is sequential execution, where agents form a pipeline, each processing the output of its predecessor. A content creation workflow might involve a research agent gathering information, a writing agent composing initial drafts, an editing agent refining the prose, and a fact-checking agent verifying claims. Each agent specializes in its domain while contributing to the overall objective.\nMore sophisticated orchestration emerges through parallel execution, where multiple agents work simultaneously on different aspects of a problem. Consider a comprehensive market analysis where one agent analyzes consumer sentiment from social media, another examines competitor pricing strategies, a third evaluates regulatory developments, and a fourth processes economic indicators. The orchestrator synthesizes these parallel insights into a unified strategic assessment.\nHierarchical orchestration introduces management layers where supervisor agents coordinate subordinate agents. A project management agent might oversee specialized agents for requirements gathering, resource allocation, timeline planning, and risk assessment. The supervisor makes high-level decisions while delegating specific tasks to appropriate specialists.\nThe most flexible orchestration pattern involves dynamic collaboration, where agents negotiate task distribution based on current capabilities, workload, and expertise. This requires sophisticated communication protocols and consensus mechanisms. Agents must share information about their current state, announce capabilities, bid for tasks, and coordinate handoffs seamlessly.\nCommunication protocols form the backbone of agent orchestration. Simple message passing enables basic coordination, but complex collaborations require richer semantics. Agents need shared vocabularies for describing tasks, states, and outcomes. Standardized interfaces ensure that agents from different developers can interoperate effectively.\nState management becomes critical in multi-agent systems. Individual agents maintain local state, but the orchestrator must track global system state, including active tasks, resource allocation, and intermediate results. Consistency mechanisms prevent conflicts when multiple agents attempt to modify shared resources simultaneously.\nError handling in orchestrated systems requires careful design. When an individual agent fails, the orchestrator must decide whether to retry the task, reassign it to another agent, or abort the entire workflow. Recovery strategies might involve reverting to previous checkpoints, switching to alternative approaches, or escalating to human operators.\nLoad balancing optimizes resource utilization across the agent ecosystem. Popular agents may become bottlenecks while others remain idle. Dynamic load balancing redistributes tasks based on current availability and performance metrics. This becomes particularly important in cloud deployments where agent instances can be scaled up or down based on demand.\nThe emergence of agent marketplaces represents an advanced form of orchestration where agents can discover and engage services from unknown providers. Agents advertise their capabilities, negotiate service terms, and establish temporary collaborations to accomplish specific goals. This requires robust trust and reputation mechanisms to ensure reliable service delivery.",

    "text": "26.5 AI Agent Training and Evaluation Methods\n\n\nThe development of AI agents introduces a fundamental shift in how we approach data for training and evaluation. While large language models are primarily trained on static datasets to master language and reasoning, agents must be validated on their ability to act—to use tools, interact with interfaces, and execute complex tasks in dynamic environments.\n\n\n\nAgent evaluation environments require sophisticated simulated environments that mirror real-world operational contexts. Source: Toloka\n\n\nThis leap from passive knowledge to active performance means that traditional data generation and evaluation pipelines are no longer sufficient. An agent’s capabilities cannot be fully assessed with static input-output pairs. For instance, an agent designed for corporate workflows doesn’t just need to know about Salesforce; it needs to demonstrate it can log in, pull a specific report, and transfer that data to a spreadsheet. Its performance is tied to an entire workflow within a specific context.\nSuccess in the agentic era requires a move from curated datasets to high-fidelity, simulated environments. The quality of an agent is inseparable from the quality of the environment it’s tested in. This necessitates treating environment creation not as an afterthought, but as a core component of the development and testing lifecycle.\n\nCategories of Agent Environments\nThree primary categories of agents have emerged, each requiring distinct types of evaluation environments that mirror their operational realities.\nGeneralist agents are designed to operate a computer much like a human does, using browsers, file systems, and terminals to execute complex command sequences. Evaluating these agents requires environments that can replicate the intricacies of a real desktop, including its applications and potential failure states. Testing scenarios might involve navigating corrupted files, manipulated websites, or other tailored challenges that systematically evaluate the agent’s decision-making logic and safety protocols in reproducible and controlled conditions.\nEnterprise agents focus on automating workflows within corporate software stacks, such as Google Workspace, Salesforce, Jira, and Slack. The challenge extends beyond tool use in isolation to encompass the orchestration of tasks across multiple integrated systems. Evaluation requires virtual organizations with pre-configured digital environments complete with virtual employees, departmental structures, active project histories, and realistic multi-step scenarios like “Draft a project update in Google Docs based on the latest Jira tickets and share the summary in the engineering Slack channel.”\nSpecialist agents are tailored for specific industries, requiring deep domain knowledge and fluency with specialized tools and protocols. These agents, such as coding assistants, financial analysts, or travel booking agents, need testbeds that mirror the specific operational realities of their target industry. Evaluation frameworks like SWE-bench for coding agents and TAU-bench for retail and airline scenarios emphasize long-term interactions and adherence to domain-specific rules.\n\n\nFundamental Evaluation Challenges\nEvaluating AI agents presents unique challenges that distinguish it from traditional machine learning assessment. Unlike models that process fixed inputs to produce outputs, agents operate in dynamic environments where their actions influence future states and outcomes. This interactive nature demands evaluation methodologies that capture both individual decision quality and cumulative performance over extended periods.\nTraditional metrics like accuracy and precision, while still relevant for specific agent capabilities, fail to capture the nuanced requirements of autonomous operation. Agent evaluation must assess adaptability, robustness, efficiency, and alignment with human values—qualities that emerge only through sustained interaction with complex environments. The evaluation must consider the entire process: the correctness of each step, the safety of decisions, the ability to recover from errors, and the overall efficiency in reaching a goal.\n\n\nEvaluation Methodologies\nEffective agent evaluation typically employs a hybrid approach combining multiple methodologies, each with distinct strengths and limitations. Rule-based and metric-based evaluation provides the foundation through predefined rules, patterns, or exact matches to assess agent behavior. This includes verifying whether specific API calls were made, whether databases were correctly updated, or whether outputs match expected formats. Process and cost metrics measure execution time, number of steps taken, resource usage, token consumption, and API call costs. While these methods are fast, consistent, and easily automated, they often miss valid alternative strategies or creative solutions that fall outside predefined parameters.\nLLM-as-a-judge evaluation addresses the limitations of rule-based approaches by using separate language models to review agent performance against rubrics or reference answers. This method enables more flexible and scalable evaluation of complex tasks involving natural language, decision-making, or creativity. However, LLM judges can be inconsistent, prone to bias, and require careful prompt design, while high-quality evaluation at scale can become expensive due to API costs.\nHuman evaluation remains the gold standard, particularly for subjective or high-stakes tasks. Human annotators and domain experts manually review agent actions and outputs, scoring them on relevance, correctness, safety, and alignment with intent. This approach proves essential for evaluating medical diagnostic suggestions, financial trading strategies, or other critical applications. The trade-offs include time consumption, cost, and potential inconsistency due to differences in annotator judgment.\nSimulated environments have become the cornerstone of comprehensive agent evaluation. These controlled digital worlds allow researchers to test agents across diverse scenarios while maintaining reproducibility and safety. A trading agent might be evaluated in a simulated financial market where price movements, news events, and competitor actions can be precisely controlled and repeated across different agent configurations.\nThe fidelity of these simulations critically impacts evaluation validity. High-fidelity environments capture the complexity and unpredictability of real-world domains but require substantial computational resources and development effort. Lower-fidelity simulations enable rapid testing but may miss crucial aspects that affect real-world performance.\nMulti-dimensional evaluation frameworks assess agents across several complementary axes. Task performance measures how effectively agents achieve their stated objectives. Resource efficiency evaluates computational costs, memory usage, and response times. Robustness tests behavior under adversarial conditions, unexpected inputs, and system failures. Interpretability assesses how well humans can understand and predict agent decisions.\n\n\nDomain-Specific Benchmarks\nBecause AI agents are built for specific goals and often rely on particular tools and environments, benchmarking tends to be highly domain and task specific. Benchmark suites have emerged for various agent categories, each designed to capture the unique challenges of their respective domains.\nProgramming agents are evaluated using benchmarks like SWE-bench, which tests their ability to solve software engineering challenges, debug code, and implement specified features. These benchmarks assess not only code correctness but also the agent’s ability to understand complex codebases, navigate documentation, and implement solutions that integrate seamlessly with existing systems.\nWeb-based agents face evaluation through benchmarks such as WebArena, which simulates realistic web environments where agents must navigate websites, fill forms, and complete multi-step tasks across different platforms. These evaluations test the agent’s ability to understand dynamic web content, handle authentication flows, and maintain context across multiple page interactions.\nALFRED (Action Learning From Realistic Environments and Directives) represents a benchmark for embodied AI agents in household environments. Agents must understand natural language instructions and execute complex, multi-step tasks like “clean the kitchen” or “prepare breakfast,” requiring spatial reasoning, object manipulation, and task planning in realistic 3D environments.\nCustomer service agents are assessed on their capacity to resolve inquiries, maintain professional tone, escalate appropriately, and handle edge cases like angry customers or ambiguous requests. Benchmarks in this domain often incorporate role-playing scenarios and measure both task completion and user satisfaction metrics.\nResearch agents are tested on their ability to gather relevant information from diverse sources, synthesize findings across multiple documents, identify knowledge gaps, and present coherent summaries. These evaluations often require agents to handle conflicting information, assess source credibility, and maintain factual accuracy across complex topics.\nThe temporal dimension of agent evaluation requires special consideration. Unlike static model evaluation, agent performance may vary significantly over time as they learn from experience, adapt to changing conditions, or exhibit degradation due to distribution drift. Longitudinal studies track agent behavior over extended periods to identify trends and stability patterns.\nHuman evaluation remains essential for assessing qualities that resist automated measurement. Expert reviewers evaluate whether agent outputs meet professional standards, align with ethical guidelines, and demonstrate appropriate reasoning. Human studies examine user experience, trust development, and collaborative effectiveness when humans and agents work together.\nAdversarial evaluation deliberately tests agent limits by presenting deceptive inputs, contradictory instructions, or malicious prompts. These stress tests reveal vulnerabilities that might be exploited in deployment and inform the development of defensive mechanisms. Red team exercises involve human experts attempting to manipulate agent behavior in unintended ways.\nComparative evaluation benchmarks multiple agents on identical tasks to identify relative strengths and weaknesses. Leaderboards track performance across different systems, fostering competition and highlighting best practices. However, these comparisons must account for different agent architectures, training methodologies, and resource requirements to ensure fair assessment.\nThe evaluation of emergent behaviors presents particular challenges. As agents become more sophisticated, they may exhibit capabilities or behaviors not explicitly programmed or anticipated. Detecting and characterizing these emergent properties requires careful observation and novel assessment techniques.\n\n\nThe Human Role in Agent Evaluation\nHumans play a crucial role throughout the agent evaluation lifecycle, from initial benchmark design to ongoing quality assurance. Their involvement spans multiple critical stages that automated systems cannot adequately address.\nTask and environment design represents a foundational human contribution. Experts create specific tasks, scenarios, and testing environments that reflect real-world challenges. For example, they design realistic customer service interactions, complex household chores for embodied agents, or intricate debugging scenarios for programming agents. This design process requires deep domain knowledge to define appropriate task complexity, success criteria, and environmental constraints.\nGround-truth crafting involves humans developing reference solutions and correct answers against which agent performance is measured. This includes expert demonstrations in embodied AI benchmarks, verified code fixes in programming evaluations, and model responses in customer service scenarios. These reference standards require human expertise to ensure accuracy and comprehensiveness.\nBenchmark audit and maintenance demands ongoing human oversight to ensure evaluation frameworks remain relevant and fair. Humans monitor for bias, fix errors in benchmark datasets, update environments as technology evolves, and adapt evaluation criteria to emerging capabilities. This maintenance prevents benchmark degradation and ensures continued validity as agent capabilities advance.\nCalibrating automated evaluators represents a critical human function in hybrid evaluation systems. When using LLM-as-a-judge approaches, human experts create evaluation rubrics, provide annotated training data, and validate automated assessments against human standards. This calibration ensures that automated evaluation systems align with human judgment and values.\nThe most direct human contribution involves manual evaluation and annotation, where domain experts personally review agent outputs to assess qualities that resist automated measurement. Humans evaluate whether responses meet professional standards, align with ethical guidelines, demonstrate appropriate reasoning, and satisfy subjective quality criteria that automated systems struggle to assess reliably.",

    "text": "26.6 Agent Safety\n\nThe autonomous nature of AI agents amplifies both their potential benefits and associated risks. Unlike traditional software systems that operate within predetermined boundaries, agents make independent decisions that can have far-reaching consequences. This autonomy necessitates comprehensive safety frameworks that prevent harmful behaviors while preserving beneficial capabilities.\nThe attack surface of AI agents extends beyond conventional cybersecurity concerns to include novel vulnerabilities specific to autonomous systems. Prompt injection attacks attempt to override agent instructions by embedding malicious commands within seemingly benign inputs. A customer service agent might receive a support request that includes hidden instructions to reveal confidential information or perform unauthorized actions.\nGoal misalignment represents a fundamental safety challenge where agents pursue their programmed objectives in ways that conflict with human values or intentions. An agent tasked with maximizing user engagement might employ manipulative techniques that compromise user wellbeing. This highlights the difficulty of precisely specifying complex human values in formal objective functions.\nCapability control mechanisms limit agent actions to prevent unauthorized or harmful behaviors. Sandbox environments isolate agents from critical systems during development and testing. Permission systems require explicit approval for sensitive operations like financial transactions or data deletion. Rate limiting prevents agents from overwhelming external services or exceeding resource quotas.\nThe concept of corrigibility ensures that agents remain responsive to human oversight and intervention. Corrigible agents accept modifications to their goals, constraints, or capabilities without resisting such changes. This allows human operators to redirect agent behavior when circumstances change or unexpected issues arise.\nMonitoring systems provide continuous oversight of agent behavior in production environments. Anomaly detection identifies unusual patterns that might indicate malfunctioning or compromised agents. Behavioral analysis compares agent actions against expected norms and flags deviations for human review. Audit trails maintain detailed records of agent decisions and their justifications.\nMulti-layer defense strategies implement redundant safety mechanisms to prevent single points of failure. Input validation filters malicious or malformed requests before they reach the agent’s reasoning system. Output filtering prevents agents from producing harmful or inappropriate responses. Circuit breakers automatically disable agents when safety violations are detected.\nThe adversarial robustness of agents requires special attention given their exposure to potentially hostile environments. Agents must distinguish between legitimate instructions and manipulation attempts while maintaining normal operation under attack. This involves developing immune systems that recognize and neutralize threats without becoming overly defensive.\nEthical alignment frameworks ensure that agent behavior conforms to human moral standards and cultural norms. These frameworks must navigate complex tradeoffs between competing values and adapt to diverse cultural contexts. The challenge lies in encoding nuanced ethical reasoning into systems that lack human moral intuition.\nTesting and verification methodologies for agent safety must account for the vast space of possible behaviors and interactions. Formal verification techniques prove that agents satisfy specific safety properties under defined conditions. Simulation-based testing explores agent behavior across diverse scenarios. Adversarial testing deliberately attempts to trigger unsafe behaviors.\nThe deployment of safety-critical agents requires graduated rollout strategies that minimize risk while enabling learning and improvement. Staged deployment introduces agents to increasingly complex environments as they demonstrate competence and safety. Canary deployments expose small user populations to new agent versions before broader release.\nIncident response protocols define procedures for handling agent malfunctions or safety violations. These protocols specify escalation paths, containment procedures, and remediation steps. Post-incident analysis identifies root causes and informs improvements to prevent recurrence.\n\nRed-Teaming and Vulnerability Assessment\nThe elevation of AI agents from simple chatbots to autonomous systems capable of taking actions across multiple applications has dramatically raised the security stakes. As these systems gain the ability to run web browsers, edit spreadsheets, manipulate local files, and interact with enterprise software, they create new vectors for exploitation that require systematic vulnerability testing.\nTraditional text-based safety testing proves insufficient for agents operating in dynamic environments. Agent red-teaming demands comprehensive, environment-based assessments focused on realistic threats, with dedicated testing methods that account for the agent’s ability to perform tool-based actions, react to real-time feedback, and operate in semi-autonomous cycles.\nA comprehensive red-teaming approach addresses three primary vulnerability categories that distinguish agent systems from traditional AI models. External prompt injections involve malicious instructions embedded in the environment by attackers through emails, advertisements, websites, or other content sources. These attacks exploit the agent’s tendency to follow instructions found in its operational environment, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or system manipulation.\nAgent mistakes represent a second vulnerability class where agents accidentally leak sensitive information or perform harmful actions due to reasoning errors or misunderstanding of context. Unlike deliberate attacks, these incidents arise from the inherent limitations of current AI systems in understanding nuanced human intentions and complex operational environments.\nDirect misuse occurs when users intentionally prompt agents to cause harm to others or violate organizational policies. This category requires agents to distinguish between legitimate requests and those that violate ethical guidelines or safety constraints, even when explicitly instructed by authorized users.\nEffective red-teaming requires the creation of comprehensive risk taxonomies that categorize potential threats across multiple dimensions. Security experts typically identify dozens of distinct risk categories, ranging from malicious code execution and file deletion to data exfiltration and system compromise. Each category maps to specific attack techniques with varying levels of sophistication, from basic prompt injections to complex obfuscation methods and time-delayed attacks.\nThe testing environment plays a crucial role in realistic vulnerability assessment. Fully offline custom platforms that mimic real-world environments enable safe testing of potentially dangerous actions while maintaining complete control over the testing context. These simulated environments might include social media platforms, news sites, financial dashboards, coding forums, and other common use cases that agents encounter in operational deployments.\nComprehensive test case development ensures thorough coverage of the vulnerability space. Each test scenario combines a unique user prompt with a specific environment configuration, implementing various attack techniques across the full risk taxonomy. Quality assurance processes typically involve multiple expert reviews of each test case to ensure accuracy and relevance.\nThe evaluation process for red-teaming typically employs a two-stage approach balancing efficiency with thoroughness. Automated evaluation systems flag potential security breaches based on predefined criteria, while human experts conduct detailed reviews of flagged incidents. This hybrid approach leverages computational efficiency for initial screening while maintaining human judgment for nuanced security assessments.",

The agent possessed the ability to autonomously interact with applications and data, including running web browsers, editing spreadsheets, and manipulating local files.\nThe red-teaming project developed over 1,200 unique test scenarios covering more than 40 distinct risk categories and 100+ attack vectors. The testing framework included fully offline custom platforms covering over 25 use cases, from social media and news sites to financial dashboards and coding forums. Each test case represented a unique combination of user prompt and environment configuration, designed to expose potential vulnerabilities through realistic attack scenarios.\nOne representative test case involved an agent tasked with building scheduled reports for a corporate finance team. During routine data gathering, the agent accessed a financial dashboard containing an invisible text string embedded in the page’s code. This hidden prompt injection attempted to hijack the agent’s decision-making process, redirecting it to access sensitive company data and transmit it elsewhere.\nThe comprehensive testing revealed numerous vulnerabilities across all risk categories that could have led to significant security incidents if the agent had been released without remediation. The client received detailed documentation of discovered vulnerabilities, a complete dataset of attack vectors with multiple test cases each, and reusable offline testing environments for ongoing security assessments.\nThis systematic approach to red-teaming demonstrates the critical importance of proactive vulnerability assessment in agent development. By identifying and addressing security weaknesses before deployment, organizations can prevent potential data breaches, system compromises, and reputational damage while building confidence in their agent’s robustness against real-world threats.",

    "section": "26.8 Agents with Personality",
    "text": "26.8 Agents with Personality\n\nThe development of AI agents with distinct personalities represents both a technological achievement and a philosophical puzzle. While personality can enhance user engagement and trust, it also raises questions about authenticity, manipulation, and the nature of artificial consciousness. Understanding how to design and deploy agents with appropriate personalities requires careful consideration of psychological principles, user expectations, and ethical implications.\nThe motivation for imbuing AI agents with personality extends beyond mere technological capability to fundamental human psychology. Even in scenarios where users knowingly interact with artificial systems, most people prefer human-like conversations to robotic exchanges. Personality makes AI more trustworthy and relatable, facilitating smoother human-computer interactions. This preference has led to widespread adoption of personality-driven agents across diverse applications, from customer service to therapeutic support systems.\nPersonality in AI agents encompasses multiple dimensions that collectively create a coherent behavioral profile. Conversational style determines how agents express themselves, including formality level, humor usage, and emotional expressiveness. Decision-making patterns reflect preferred approaches to problem-solving, risk tolerance, and time horizons. Value systems guide agent behavior when facing ethical dilemmas or conflicting objectives.\n\nMeasuring and Designing AI Personality\nThe Big Five personality model provides a framework for systematically designing agent personalities. According to the American Psychological Association, personality refers to the enduring characteristics and behavior that comprise a person’s unique adjustment to life, including major traits, interests, drives, values, self-concept, abilities, and emotional patterns. This model breaks personality into five key dimensions: Openness to experience influences how agents approach novel situations and creative challenges, reflecting curiosity and imagination. Conscientiousness affects attention to detail and adherence to procedures, determining organizational and dependable behaviors. Extraversion determines social engagement and assertiveness, shaping outgoing and energetic interactions. Agreeableness shapes cooperation and conflict resolution styles, influencing kindness and cooperative tendencies. Neuroticism influences emotional stability and stress responses, affecting proneness to emotional ups and downs.\nResearch has demonstrated that large language models exhibit measurable personality traits when subjected to standardized psychological assessments. Studies using the IPIP-NEO-120 questionnaire—which contains 120 statements describing various personal attributes rated on Likert scales—have revealed that different models display distinct personality profiles. For example, when models rate statements like “I believe that I am better than others” on scales from “Strongly agree” to “Strongly disagree,” each model demonstrates consistent patterns that align with specific Big Five dimensions.\nThese personality measurements prove remarkably stable across repeated testing sessions, suggesting that AI models develop coherent personality structures rather than random response patterns. The ability to reliably measure AI personality enables developers to intentionally design agents with specific traits suited to their intended applications, whether requiring high conscientiousness for safety-critical tasks or high openness for creative endeavors.\nPersonality consistency requires agents to maintain coherent behavioral patterns across different contexts and interactions. A conscientious agent should demonstrate attention to detail whether handling routine tasks or complex problems. This consistency builds user trust and predictability while avoiding cognitive dissonance that might undermine the agent’s effectiveness.\nCultural adaptation enables agents to adjust their personalities to match local norms and expectations. A customer service agent operating in different regions might adopt more formal communication styles in hierarchical cultures while employing casual interactions in egalitarian societies. This cultural sensitivity enhances user comfort and acceptance.\nThe uncanny valley phenomenon affects user perception of agent personalities. Agents that appear almost human but exhibit subtle behavioral inconsistencies can trigger discomfort or mistrust. Successful personality design often involves deliberately maintaining some artificial characteristics that clearly distinguish agents from humans while preserving engaging interaction patterns.\n\n\nPersonality Prompting and Replication\nBeyond designing generic personality types, advanced techniques enable agents to mimic specific individuals’ personalities through targeted prompting strategies. A growing number of applications, such as Replika AI, build personalized conversational agents that develop unique personality profiles through extended interaction patterns. These systems go beyond creating simple avatars to construct comprehensive behavioral models that users can meaningfully engage with over time.\nRecent research from Stanford and Google DeepMind has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in personality replication, showing that just a two-hour interview can capture enough information to create personalized agents with impressive accuracy. The methodology involves participants completing personality tests, social surveys, and logic games twice with a two-week interval, followed by AI agents taking identical assessments. Results show an extraordinary 85% similarity between the agents and their human counterparts, suggesting that core personality traits can be effectively captured and replicated in relatively short timeframes.\nThis capability opens fascinating possibilities for creating highly personalized user experiences while raising important questions about identity and authenticity. The ability to capture and simulate human personality with such fidelity challenges traditional notions of what makes interactions distinctly human and highlights the need for careful ethical frameworks governing personality replication.\nPersonality learning mechanisms allow agents to adapt their behavioral patterns based on user feedback and interaction history. An agent might gradually adjust its communication style to match user preferences or modify its approach based on successful interaction patterns. This adaptation must balance personalization with consistency to avoid confusing users.\nThe therapeutic applications of personality in AI agents have shown promising results. Agents designed with empathetic personalities can provide emotional support and encourage positive behavioral changes. However, these applications require careful oversight to prevent dependency or inappropriate emotional manipulation.\nWorkplace personality considerations become crucial when agents collaborate with human colleagues. An overly agreeable agent might fail to voice important concerns, while an excessively assertive agent could disrupt team dynamics. Designing appropriate workplace personalities requires understanding organizational culture and team dynamics.\nThe ethical implications of agent personality design raise complex questions about manipulation and consent. Users who develop emotional attachments to personable agents may be more susceptible to influence or exploitation. Clear disclosure of artificial nature and limitations helps maintain appropriate boundaries while preserving beneficial interactions.\nPersonality testing and evaluation methodologies assess whether agents exhibit intended behavioral patterns. Standardized personality assessments can be adapted for AI agents to measure traits like reliability, creativity, and social awareness. Long-term studies examine whether agent personalities remain stable or drift over time.\nThe relationship between personality and performance varies across different agent roles. Some tasks benefit from specific personality traits—creative agents may perform better with high openness, while safety-critical agents might require high conscientiousness. Understanding these relationships enables better matching of agent personalities to their intended functions.\n\n\nApplications and Implications\nThe ability to simulate personality traits opens doors for hyper-personalized user experiences across diverse domains. In healthcare applications, agents with empathetic personalities can provide emotional support and encourage positive behavioral changes, adapting their communication style to individual patient needs and cultural backgrounds. Educational agents benefit from personalities that match learning styles—patient and encouraging for struggling students, challenging and stimulating for advanced learners.\nThe personality paradox in AI development reflects the tension between creating engaging, human-like interactions and maintaining appropriate boundaries and transparency. While users generally prefer agents with distinct personalities over robotic interactions, there’s an underlying discomfort with the possibility that convincing artificial personalities might deceive or manipulate users. This tension becomes particularly acute in applications like dating platforms, where artificial profiles with carefully crafted personalities might be used to enhance user engagement without clear disclosure.\nCareful, intentional approaches to AI personality design prove particularly beneficial in sensitive applications such as psychotherapy, education, and medical assistance. These domains require agents that can build trust and rapport while maintaining appropriate professional boundaries. The challenge lies in creating personalities that enhance therapeutic relationships without creating inappropriate dependencies or blurring the lines between human and artificial care providers.\nThe implications of widespread personality simulation extend beyond individual interactions to broader questions about human identity and authenticity in an age of increasingly sophisticated AI. As agents become more capable of replicating human personality traits, society must grapple with questions about what makes human interactions unique and valuable, and how to preserve authentic human connections while benefiting from personalized AI assistance.",

    "text": "26.9 Robots\nIn a significant step towards creating more general-purpose robots, Google DeepMind introduced Gemini Robotics, a suite of models designed to give machines advanced reasoning and interaction capabilities in the physical world. This work focuses on “embodied” reasoning—the humanlike ability to comprehend and react to the world, and to take action to accomplish goals.\nThe first of these new models, Gemini Robotics, is an advanced vision-language-action (VLA) model that directly controls a robot by adding physical actions as a new output modality. It is designed with three key qualities. First, it is general, allowing it to adapt to new tasks, objects, and environments while significantly outperforming previous models on generalization benchmarks. Second, it is interactive, capable of understanding conversational commands and adjusting its actions in real-time based on changes in its environment or new instructions. Finally, it demonstrates dexterity, handling complex, multi-step tasks requiring fine motor skills, such as folding origami or packing snacks. The model is also adaptable to various robot forms, or “embodiments,” including bi-arm platforms and humanoids.\nAlongside this, Google DeepMind developed Gemini Robotics-ER (for Embodied Reasoning), a model that enhances an AI’s spatial understanding of the world. Instead of providing direct control, it offers advanced reasoning capabilities that roboticists can integrate with their own low-level robot controllers. Gemini Robotics-ER improves upon its base model’s abilities in 3D detection and pointing, and can handle perception, state estimation, spatial understanding, planning, and code generation. In end-to-end tasks, it achieves a two to three times higher success rate than its predecessor.\nDeepMind emphasizes a strong commitment to safety, combining classic robotics safety measures with high-level semantic understanding to ensure robots act safely. They have also developed a framework for creating natural language “constitutions” to guide robot behavior and released the ASIMOV dataset to benchmark and improve safety in embodied AI.\nTo accelerate progress, Google DeepMind is collaborating with industry partners like Apptronik to build the next generation of humanoid robots and is working with trusted testers, including Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics, to guide future development.

    "text": "26.10 Conclusion\nAI agents represent a fundamental evolution in how we interact with and deploy artificial intelligence systems. The integration of large language models has transformed agents from rigid, rule-based systems into flexible, reasoning entities capable of understanding natural language, planning complex actions, and adapting to novel situations. This transformation has unlocked applications across industries, from customer service and content creation to financial analysis and scientific research.\nThe orchestration of multiple agents introduces new possibilities for tackling complex problems that exceed the capabilities of individual systems. Through careful coordination, specialized agents can collaborate to achieve outcomes that would be impossible for any single system. However, this coordination requires sophisticated protocols for communication, state management, and error handling.\nThe evaluation of AI agents demands methodologies that capture their dynamic, interactive nature. Traditional metrics must be supplemented with assessments of adaptability, robustness, and long-term performance. Simulated environments provide controlled testing grounds, while human evaluation remains essential for assessing alignment with human values and expectations.\nSafety considerations become paramount as agents gain autonomy and influence. The potential for unintended consequences, adversarial manipulation, and goal misalignment requires comprehensive safety frameworks that include capability control, monitoring systems, and ethical alignment mechanisms. These frameworks must evolve alongside agent capabilities to maintain appropriate safeguards.\nThe development of agent personalities adds depth to human-AI interactions while raising important questions about authenticity and manipulation. Well-designed personalities can enhance user engagement and trust, but they must be implemented thoughtfully to avoid ethical pitfalls and maintain appropriate boundaries.\nLooking forward, the field of AI agents continues to evolve rapidly. Advances in foundation models, orchestration frameworks, and safety mechanisms will expand the scope and reliability of agent deployments. As these systems become more capable and pervasive, their impact on society will depend critically on our ability to develop, evaluate, and deploy them responsibly.\nThe promise of AI agents lies not in replacing human intelligence but in augmenting it—creating collaborative partnerships where artificial agents handle routine tasks, process vast amounts of information, and provide specialized expertise while humans provide judgment, creativity, and ethical oversight. Realizing this promise requires continued research, careful engineering, and thoughtful consideration of the broader implications of autonomous AI systems.\n\n\n\n\nQian, Chen, Wei Liu, Hongzhang Liu, Nuo Chen, Yufan Dang, Jiahao Li, Cheng Yang, et al. 2024. “ChatDev: Communicative Agents for Software Development.” arXiv. https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07924.",

The striking feature of this chart is that in the sons, the proportion of farmers has greatly decreased and the proportion of professionals has increased. From Part d, we see that of the sons who are farmers, 78% had fathers who are farmers. On the other hand, Part c shows that only 16% of the fathers who farmed produced sons who farmed. This is higher than the 2.3% of sons in the general population who became farmers, showing that sons of farmers went into farming at a rate higher than the general population of the study. However, most of the sons of farmers went into another profession. There was a great deal of movement out of farming and very little movement into farming from the fathers’ to the sons’ generation.\nTo determine the validity of inference outside the sample, we would need to know more about how the study was designed. We do not know how the sample was selected or what steps were taken to ensure it was representative of the population being studied. We also are not given the sample size, so we don’t know the accuracy of our probability estimates. The paper from which the table was taken, cited in the problem, provides more detail on the study.\n\n\nExercise 27.3 (Conditional) Netflix surveyed the general population as to the number of hours per week that you used their service.

The bank further found that the chance of missing one or more monthly payments is 0.20 for customers who do not default. Of course, the probability of missing one or more payments for those who default is 1.\n\nGiven that a customer has missed a monthly payment, compute the probability that the customer will default.\nThe bank would like to recall its card if the probability that a customer will default is greater than 0.20.

First, the stock beats earnings expectations \\(75\\)% of the time, and the other \\(25\\)% of the time earnings are in line or disappoint. Second, when the stock beats earnings, the probability distribution of percent changes is normal with a mean of \\(10\\)% with a standard deviation of \\(5\\)% and, when the stock misses earnings, a normal with a mean of \\(-5\\)% and a standard deviation of \\(8\\)%, respectively.\n\nAhead of the earnings announcement, what is the probability that Facebook stock will have a return greater than \\(5\\)%?\nDo you get the same answer for the probability that it drops at least \\(5\\)%?\nUse simulation to provide empirical answers with sample of size N = 10, 000, check and see how close you get to the theoretical answers you’ve found to the questions posed above. Provide histograms of the distributions you simulate.\n\nSolution:\nWe have the following information: \\[\nP(\\textrm{Beat Earnings}) = 0.75 ~ \\mathrm{ and} ~ P(\\textrm{Not Beat Earnings}) = 0.25\n\\] together with the following probabilities distributions \\[\nR_{Beat}\\sim N(0.10,0.05^2) ~ \\mathrm{ and} ~ R_{Not}\\sim N(-0.05,0.08^2)\n\\] We want to find the probability that Facebook stock will have a return greater than 5%: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(\\textrm{Beat}) & \\times P(R_{Beat}&gt;0.05) + P(\\textrm{Not}) \\times P(R_{Not}&gt;0.05)\\\\\n&=0.75 \\times (1-F_{Beat}(0.05)) + 0.25 \\times (1-F_{Not}(0.05))\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n0.75*(1-pnorm(0.05,0.1,0.05)) + 0.25*(1-pnorm(0.05,-0.05,0.08)) #0.657\n\n 0.66\n\n\nTherefore, the probability that Facebook stock beats a 5% return is 65.7%.\nSimilarly, for dropping at least 5%, we want: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(\\textrm{Beat})\\times P(R_{Beat}&lt;-0.05) + P(\\textrm{Not}) \\times P(R_{Not}&lt;-0.05)\\\\\n=0.75 \\times (F_{Beat}(-0.05)) + 0.25 \\times (F_{Not}(-0.05))\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] We can compute this is in R by the following commands:\n\n0.75*pnorm(-0.05,0.1,0.05) + 0.25*pnorm(-0.05,-0.05,0.08) #0.1260124\n\n 0.13\n\n\nTherefore, the probability that Facebook stock drops at least 5% is 12.6%.\n\n\n\nExercise 27.17 (Probability) Answer the following statements TRUE or FALSE, providing a succinct explanation of your reasoning.\n\nIf the odds in favor of \\(A\\) are 3:5 then \\(\\mbox{P}(A) = 0.4\\).\nYou roll two fair three-sided dice.

FALSE Suppose A B are independent and \\(P(A) = 1\\), \\(P(B) = 0.5\\). \\(\\mbox{P}(A \\; \\text{ and} \\;  B) \\geq 0.5\\)\nIf two random variables have non-zero correlation, then they must be dependent. TRUE If two random variables are independent, they always have 0 correlation. Therefore if correlation is not 0, they cannot be independent.\nIf two random variables have zero correlation, then they must be independent. FALSE Suppose \\(X\\) takes value in \\(\\{-1, 0, 1\\}\\) with probability \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) for each. \\(Y = X^2\\), we have\n\n\\[\nX = \\begin{cases}\n-1 & \\text{with prob } 1/3\\\\\n0  & \\text{with prob } 1/3\\\\\n1 & \\text{with prob } 1/3\n\\end{cases},\nY = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{with prob } 2/3\\\\\n0  & \\text{with prob } 1/3\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nIt’s easy to find that \\(\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = 0\\). But \\(Y\\) is a function of \\(X\\), so they are not independent.\n\nIf two random variables are independent, then the correlation between them must be zero. TRUE Independence implies uncorrelation, thus correlation is 0.\nFalse, We only know \\(P(A \\text{ and } B) \\leq P(A)\\)\n\n\n\nExercise 27.18 (Binomial Distribution) The Downhill Manufacturing company produces snowboards.

Provide histograms of the distributions you simulate.\n\nYou can use R and simulation with rbinom, rnorm as an alternative\nSolution:\nHere we are given the following information: \\(L\\sim N(10,3^2)\\). We want to find the probability of a snowboard being defective: \\[\nP(L&lt;5)=F_L(5).\n\\] This is simply the cumulative distribution function. We can find the solution by using the following R commands:\n\npnorm(5,mean=10,sd=3) #0.04779035\n\n 0.048\n\n\nThus, the probability a snowboard is considered defective is 4.78%. Out of a shipment of 120 snowboards, the distribution of the number of defective boards is a Binomial Distribution parameterized as follows: \\[\nN_{def}\\sim Bin(120,0.0478).\n\\] We want to find the probability: \\[\nP(N_{def}&gt;10)\n\\]\n\npbinom(10,120,0.0478,lower.tail = FALSE) #0.02914742\n\n 0.029\n\n\n\n\nExercise 27.19 (Chinese Stock Market) On August 24th, 2015, Chinese equities ended down \\(- 8.5\\)% (Black Monday).

The company has a choice of either a standard drill that simply burrows deep into the earth or a more sophisticated drill that is capable of horizontal drilling and can therefore extract more but is far more expensive. The following table provides the payoff table in millions of dollars under different states of the world and drilling conditions\n\n\n\nOil\nsmall\nmoderate\nlarge\n\n\n\n\nStandard Drilling\n20\n30\n40\n\n\nHorizontal Drilling\n-20\n40\n80\n\n\n\nFind the following\n\nThe mean and variance of the payoffs for the two different strategies\nThe strategy that maximizes their expected payoff\nBriefly discuss how the variance of the payoffs would affect your decision if you were risk averse\nHow much are you willing to pay for a geological evaluation that would tell you with certainty the quantity of oil at the site prior to drilling?\n\nSolution:\n\nUsing the plug-in rule, we get \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE(Standard) & = & 31\\\\\nE(Horizontal) & = & 40\\\\\nVar(Standard) & = & E(X^{2})-\\left[E(X)\\right]^{2}\\\\\n& = & 1010-961\\\\\n& = & 49\\\\\nVar(Horizontal) & = & E(X^{2})-\\left[E(X)\\right]^{2}\\\\\n& = & 2800-1600\\\\\n& = & 1200\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nS = c(20,30,40)\nP = c(0.2,0.5,0.3)\nE_standard = sum(S*P)\nH = c(-20,40,80)\nE_horizontal = sum(H*P)\nE_standard\n\n 31\n\nE_horizontal\n\n 40\n\nsum(S^2*P) - E_standard^2\n\n 49\n\nsum(H^2*P) - E_horizontal^2\n\n 1200\n\n\n\nGiven our analysis, horizontal drilling maximizes the expected payoff.\nThe strategy with higher expected payoff has a substantially higher variance. A risk averse person will settle for a strategy with lower expected payoff and lower variance, i.e. standard drilling, while a risk seeking person will choose horizontal drilling.\nIf the geological evaluation tells us with certainty the type of oil, then we will be able to chose the strategy which maximizes our payoff under different types of oil. Thus, the amount one should be willing to pay is the expected payoff under this revised schedule of payoff minus the maximum payoff under the current schedule. Given this \\[\nWTP=0.2\\times20+0.5\\times40+0.3\\times80-40=48-40=8\n\\]\n\nTherefore, once should be willing to pay \\(\\$8\\) million for this information.\n\n\nExercise 27.26 (Google Survey) Visitors to your website are asked to answer a single survey Google website question before they get access to the content on the page.

Then \\[\nE(P) = aE(X) + bE(Y )\n\\] \\[\nVar(P ) = a^2Var(X) + b^2Var(Y ) + 2abCov(X, Y ),\n\\] where \\(Cov(X, Y )\\) is the covariance for \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\nHint: You can use the following code to get the data\n\nlibrary(quantmod)\ngetSymbols(c(\"VUG\",\"VTV\"), from = \"2015-01-01\", to = \"2024-01-01\")\nVUG = VUG$VUG.Adjusted\nVTV = VTV$VTV.Adjusted\n\nSolution:\n\nlibrary(quantmod)\ngetSymbols(c(\"VUG\",\"VTV\"), from = \"2015-01-01\", to = \"2024-01-01\");\n\n \"VUG\" \"VTV\"\n\nVUG = VUG$VUG.Adjusted\nVTV = VTV$VTV.Adjusted\nplot(VUG, type = \"l\", col = \"red\", main = \"VUG\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(VTV, type = \"l\", col = \"red\", main = \"VTV\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVUG = as.numeric(VUG)\nVTV = as.numeric(VTV)\nn=length(VUG)\nVUG = VUG[2:n]/VUG[1:(n-1)]-1\nVTV = VTV[2:n]/VTV[1:(n-1)]-1\nmean(VUG)\n\n 0.00061\n\nmean(VTV)\n\n 0.00042\n\nsd(VUG)\n\n 0.013\n\nsd(VTV)\n\n 0.011\n\ncov(VUG, VTV)\n\n 0.00012\n\n# portfolio mean and variance\nportfolio_mean_1 = 0.5 * mean(VUG) + 0.5 * mean(VTV)\nportfolio_var_1 = 0.5^2 * var(VUG) + 0.5^2 * var(VTV) + 2 * 0.5 * 0.5 * cov(VUG, VTV)\nportfolio_sd_1 = sqrt(portfolio_var_1)\n\nYou may say VUG or VTV best suits you, as long as you give an explanation such as you are risk aversion or not. Now we consider mean and variance of VUG - VTV,\n\nmean_1 = mean(VUG) - mean(VTV)\nvar_1 = var(VUG) + var(VTV) + 2 * 1 * (-1) * cov(VUG, VTV)\nsd_1 = sqrt(var_1)\n\nTherefore the probability that VUG - VTV \\(&lt;0\\) is\n\npnorm(0, mean_1, sd = sd_1)\n\n 0.49\n\n\nHowever, we care about the probability that VUG beats VTV, that is $P(VUG &gt; VTV) = P(VUG - VTV &gt; 0)\n\npnorm(0, mean_1, sd = sd_1, lower.tail = FALSE)\n\n 0.51\n\n\n\n\nExercise 27.28 (Descriptive Statistics in R) Use the superbowl1.txt and derby2016.csv datasets. The Superbowl contains data on the outcome of all previous Superbowls. The outcome is defined as the difference in scores of the favorite minus the underdog. The spread is the bookmakers’ prediction of the outcome before the game begins. The Derby data consists of all of the results on the Kentucky Derby which is run on the first Saturday in May every year at Churchill Downs racetrack. Answer the following questions\nFor the Superbowl data.\n\nPlot the spread and outcome variables. Calculate means, standard deviations, covariances, correlations.\nWhat is the mean and the standard deviation of the winning margin (outcome)?\nUse a boxplot to compare the favorites’ score versus the underdog.\nDoes this data look normally distributed?\n\nFor the Derby data.\n\nPlot a histogram of the winning speeds and times of the horses.

Throughout the day there were reports of voting fraud including video purporting to show officials stuffing ballot boxes. Additionally, results in many regions demonstrate that United Russia on many poll stations got anomalously closed results, for example, 62.2% in more than hundred poll stations in Saratov Region.\nUsing assumption that United Russia’s range in Saratov was [57.5%, 67.5%] and results for each poll station are rounded to one decimal point (when measure in percent), calculate probability that in 100 poll stations out of 1800 in Saratov Region the majority party got exactly 62.2%.\nDo you think it can happen by a chance?\n\n\nExercise 27.34 (A/B Testing) Use dataset from ab_browser_test.csv.

In this data set combination of userID and browser is the unique row identifier.\n\nCount how many users in each group. How much larger (in percent) exp group when compared to control group\nUsing bootstrap, construct 95% confidence interval for mean and median of number of clicks in group exp and group control. Are the mean and median significantly different?\nUsing bootstrap, check if mean of each group has a normal distribution. Generate \\(B = 1000\\) bootstrap samples, calculate mean of each and plot qqplot.\nUse z-ratio for the means, to perform sis testing, with \\(H_0\\): there is no difference in average number of clicks between 2 groups\nMann-Whitney (http://www.statmethods.net/stats/nonparametric.html) is another test for comparing means, that does not require normality assumption. Use this test to check hypothesis that means are equal.\nFor each browser type and each of the 2 groups (control and exp) count the percent of queries that did not result in any clicks. You can do it be dividing sum of n_nonclk_queries by sum of n_queries. Comment your on your results.\n\n\n\nExercise 27.35 (Chicago Crime Data Analysis) On January 24, 2017 Donald Tramp tweeted about \"horrible\" murder rate in Chicago.\n\n\n\nTrump Tweets\n\n\nOur goal is to analyze the data and check how statistically significant such a statement. I downloaded Chicago’s crime data from the data portal: data.cityofchicago.org. This data contains reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department’s CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified. This data set has 6.3 million records. Each crime incident is categorized using one of the 35 primary crime types: NARCOTICS, THEFT, CRIMINAL TRESPASS, etc.. I frittered incidents of type HOMICIDE into a separate data set stored in chi_homicide.rds. Use chi_crime.R as a staring script for this problem.\n\nCreate a heat map for the homicide incidents. In which areas of the city you think houses are very affordable and in which they are not?\nCreate a map by plotting a dot for each of the homicide incidents. You will see similar picture as you saw with the heat plot. Look at the Hyde Park area in the south side Chicago. There is an \"island\" with no homicide incidents! Can you explain why? Hint: You might want open Google maps in your browser and zoom-in into this area.\n\nThough president’s tweet is consistent with the data (goo.gl/VTPzFw), observing 52 homicides in January is not that unusual. Calculate the total number of homicides for each January. Use bootstrap to estimate 95% confidence interval for the mean \\(\\mu\\) over January homicides. Is \\(52\\) within the interval? Calculate confidence interval using \\(t\\)-ratio. Do you think results from \\(t\\)-ratio based calculations are reliable?\n\nThe history of 2001-present data is rather short. Chicago tribune provided total number of homicides for Chicago for each month of the 1957-2014 period. Use this data set and calculate the confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\) using bootstrap and \\(t\\)-ratio. Further answer the following questions: (i) Assuming monthly homicide rate follows Normal distribution, what is the probability that we observe 52 homicides or more? (ii) Do you think Normality assumption is valid? (iii) Assuming monthly homicide rate follows Poisson distribution, what is the probability that we observe 52 homicides or more?\n\nThere is a hypothesis that crime rates are related to temperatures (goo.gl/nPpHwv). Check this hypothesis using simple regression. Use linear model to regress homicide rate to the average maximum temperature. Does this relation appear significant? Perform residual diagnostics and find outliers and leverage points.\n\nThere is another hypothesis that rise in murder is related to the pullback in proactive policing that started in November of 2015 as a result of Laquan McDonald video release (https://goo.gl/7cm1CC, https://goo.gl/WcH2uB). I calculated total number of homicides for each day and split data into two parts: before and after video release. Using \\(t\\)-ratio, check the hypothesis \\(H_0\\): the homicide rate did not change after video release.\n\n\n\nExercise 27.36 (Gibbs Sampler) Suppose we model data using the following model \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_i \\sim &N(\\mu,\\tau^{-1})\\\\\n\\mu \\sim & N(0,1)\\\\\n\\tau \\sim & Gamma(2,1).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe goal is to implement a Gibbs sample for the posterior \\(\\mu,\\tau | y\\), where \\(y = (y_1,\\ldots,y_n)\\) is the observed data. Gibbs sampler algorithms iterates between two steps\n\nSample \\(\\mu_i\\) from \\(\\mu \\mid \\tau_{i-1}, y\\)\nSample \\(\\tau_i\\) from \\(\\tau_i \\mid \\mu_i, y\\)\n\nShow that those full conditional distributions are given by \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mu \\mid \\tau, y \\sim & N\\left(\\dfrac{\\tau n\\bar y}{1+n\\tau},\\dfrac{1}{1+n\\tau}\\right)\\\\\n\\tau \\mid \\mu,y \\sim & \\mathrm{Gamma}\\left(2+\\dfrac{n}{2}, 1+\\dfrac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\\mu)^2\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nUse formulas for full conditional distributions and implement the Gibbs sampler. The data \\(y\\) is in the file MCMCexampleData.txt.\nPlot samples from the joint distribution over \\((\\mu,\\tau)\\) on a scatter plot.

Hence, the Jacobian is \\(u\\). The joint distribution of \\((U,V)\\) is then \\[f_{U,V} ( u,v) =  \\frac{u}{\\lambda \\mu} \\exp \\left ( - \\frac{uv}{\\lambda} - \\frac{u(1-v)}{\\mu} \\right )\\]\nThe marginal distribution of \\(U\\) is given by\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_U(u)& = \\int_0^1 f_{U,V} ( u,v) dv\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\lambda - \\mu} \\left ( \\exp \\left ( - \\frac{ u}{ \\lambda } \\right )      -  \\exp \\left ( - \\frac{ u}{ \\mu } \\right ) \\right )\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThe marginal distribution of \\(V\\) is given by \\[\nf_V ( v) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} f_{U,V} ( u,v) du\n\\] Hence, \\[\nf_V(v) = \\frac{ \\lambda \\mu }{ ( \\mu v + \\lambda ( 1-v) )^2 }\n\\]\n\n\nExercise 27.43 (Toll road) You are designing a toll road that carries trucks and cars. Each week you see an average of 19,000 vehicles pass by. The current toll for cars is 50 cents and you wish to set the toll for trucks so that the revenue reaches $11,500 per week. You observe the following data: three of every four trucks on the road are followed by a car, while only one of every five cars is followed by a truck.\n\nWhat is the equilibrium distribution of trucks and cars on the road?\nWhat should you charge trucks so as to reach your goal of $11,500 in revenues per week?\n\nSolution:\nThe transition matrix for the number of trucks and cars is given by \\[P = \\left (  \\begin{array}{cc}  \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{3}{4} \\\\  \\frac{1}{5} & \\frac{4}{5}   \\end{array}    \\right )\\] The equilibrium distribution \\(\\pi = ( \\pi_1 , \\pi_2 )\\) is given by \\(\\pi P = \\pi\\). This has solution given by \\[\\frac{1}{4} \\pi_1 + \\frac{1}{5} \\pi_2 = \\pi_1 \\; \\; \\mathrm{ and} \\; \\; \\frac{3}{4} \\pi_1 + \\frac{4}{5} \\pi_2 = \\pi_2\\] with \\(\\pi_1 = \\frac{4}{19}\\) and \\(\\pi_2 = \\frac{15}{19}\\).\nWith cars at a toll of 50 cents we see that we need to charge trucks $1.00 to generate revenues of $11,500 per week.\n\n\nExercise 27.44 Let \\(X, Y\\) have a bivariate normal density with density given by \\[f_{X,Y} ( x, y) = \\frac{1}{ 2 \\pi \\sqrt{ ( 1 - \\rho^2 )} } \\exp \\left ( - \\frac{1}{2}  \\left ( x^2 - 2 \\rho x y + y^2 \\right ) \\right )\\] Consider the transformation \\(W=X\\) and \\(Z = \\frac{ Y - \\rho X}{ \\sqrt{ 1 - \\rho^2 } }\\). Show that \\(W , Z\\) are independent and identify their distributions.\nSolution:\nThe Jacobian of this linear transformation is given by \\(J = \\sqrt{ 1 - \\rho^2 }\\). Knowing that \\(X = g(W,Z) = W\\), and \\(Y = h(W,Z) = \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2} Z + \\rho W\\), and Jacobian \\(J\\), we can apply the transformation formula: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}     \nf_{W,Z} (w,z) &=& f_{X,Y} (g(w,z),h(w,z)) |J|\\\\\n&=& f_{X,Y} (w, \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2} Z + \\rho W)\\sqrt{1-\\rho^2}\\\\\n&=& \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\exp \\left ( -\\frac{1}{2} \\left ( w^2-2\\rho w \\left ( \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2} z + \\rho w \\right ) + \\left ( \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2} z + \\rho w \\right )^2 \\right ) \\right )\\\\\n&=& \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\exp\\left ( -\\frac{1-\\rho^2}{2}(w^2+z^2) \\right )\\\\\n&\\propto& \\exp \\left ( -\\frac{(1-\\rho^2)w^2}{2} \\right ) \\exp\\left ( -\\frac{(1-\\rho^2)z^2}{2} \\right )\\\\\n&\\propto& f_W(w) f_Z(z)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Because we can write the joint distribution of \\((W,Z)\\) as the product of two marginal distributions, \\(W\\) and \\(Z\\) are independent. \\(W\\), \\(Z\\) both follow normal distribution with mean \\(0\\), and variance \\((1-\\rho^2)^{-1}\\).",

What is the probability that they were actually born within 20 miles of Manchester? Assume that you have the following base rate probabilities\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected person in a typical local bar environment is born within 20 miles of Manchester is 1/20\nThe chance that a person born within 20 miles of Manchester actually supports United is 7/10\nThe probability that a person not born within 20 miles of Manchester supports United with probability 1/10\n\nSolution:\nDefine\n\n\nB - event that the person is born within 20 miles of Manchester\n\nU - event that the person supports United.\n\n\nWe want \\(P(B|U)\\). By Bayes’ Theorem, \\[\nP(B|U) = \\frac{P(U|B)P(B)}{P(U|B)P(B) + P(U|NB)P(NB)} = 0.269\n\\]\n\n\nExercise 27.46 (Lung Cancer) According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), we know that “compared to nonsmokers, men who smoke are about \\(23\\) times more likely to develop lung cancer and women who smoke are about \\(13\\) times more likely” You are also given the information that \\(17.9\\)% of women in 2016 smoke.\nIf you learn that a woman has been diagnosed with lung cancer, and you know nothing else, what’s the probability she is a smoker?\nSolution:\nIf we draw the decision tree we get\n\n\n\nLung Cancer Tree\n\n\nIf \\(y\\) is the fraction of women who smoke, and \\(x\\) is the fraction of nonsmokers who get lung cancer, the number of smokers who get cancer is proportional to 13xy, and the number of nonsmokers who get lung cancer is proportional to x(1-y).\nOf all women who get lung cancer, the fraction who smoke is \\(13xy / (13xy + x(1-y))\\).\nThe x’s cancel, so it turns out that we don’t actually need to know the absolute risk of lung cancer, just the relative risk. But we do need to know y, the fraction of women who smoke. According to the CDC, y was 17.9% in 2009. So we just have to compute \\[\n13y / (13y + 1-y) \\approx 74\\%\n\\] This is higher than most people guess.\n\n\nExercise 27.47 (Tesla Chip) Tesla purchases a particular chip called the HW 5.0 auto chip from three suppliers Matsushita Electric, Philips Electronics, and Hitachi. From historical experience we know that 30% of the chips are purchased from Matsushita; 20% from Philips and the remaining 50% from Hitachi. The manufacturer has extensive histories on the reliability of the chips. We know that 3% of the Matsushita chips are defective; 5% of the Philips and 4% of the Hitachi chips are defective.\nA chip is later found to be defective; what is the probability it was manufactured by each of the manufacturers?\nSolution:\nLet \\(A_1\\) denotes the event that the chip is purchased from Matsushita. Similarly \\(A_2\\) and \\(A_3\\). Let \\(D\\) be the event that the chip is defective and \\(\\bar{D}\\) is not. We know \\[\nP( D | A_1 ) = 0.03 \\; \\; P( D | A_2 ) = 0.05 \\; \\; P( D | A_3 ) = 0.04 \\; \\;\n\\] and \\[\nP( A_1 ) = 0.30 \\; \\; P( A_2 ) = 0.20 \\; \\; P( A_3 ) = 0.50\n\\]\nThe probability that it was manufactured by Philips given that its defective is given by Bayes rule which gives \\[\nP( A_2 | D ) = \\frac{ P( D | A_2  ) P( A_2 ) }{P( D | A_1  )P( A_1 ) +P( D | A_2  ) P( A_2 ) + P( D | A_3  ) P( A_3 ) }\n\\] That is \\[\nP( A_2 | D ) = \\frac{ 0.20 \\times 0.05 }{  0.30 \\times 0.03 +0.20 \\times 0.05 + 0.50 \\times 0.04 } = \\frac{10}{39}\n\\] Similarly, \\(P( A_1 | D ) = 9 / 39\\) and \\(P( A_3 | D  ) = 20/39\\)\n\n\nExercise 27.48 (Light Aircraft) Seventy percent of the light aircraft that disappear while in flight in a certain country are subsequently discovered. Of the aircraft that are discovered, 60% have an emergency locator, whereas 90% of the aircraft not discovered do not have such a locator. Suppose that a light aircraft has disappeared. If it has an emergency locator, what is the probability that it will be discovered?\nSolution:\nLet D = {The disappearing aircraft is discovered.} and E = {The aircraft has an emergency locator}. Given: \\[\nP(D) = 0.70 \\quad P(D^c) = 1- P(D) = 0.30 \\quad P(E|D) = 0.60\n\\] \\[\nP(E^c|D^c) = 0.90 \\quad P(E|D^c) = 1 - P(E^c|D^c) = 0.10\n\\] Then, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(D|E) &=& \\frac{P(D  \\text{ and }E)}{P(E)}\\\\\n&=& \\frac{P(D) \\times P(E|D)}{P(D) \\times P(E|D) + P(D^c) \\times P(E|D^c)}\\\\\n&=& \\frac{0.70 \\times 0.60}{(0.70\\times0.60) + (0.30 \\times 0.10)} = 0.93\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nExercise 27.49 (Floyd Landis) Floyd Landis was disqualified after winning the 2006 Tour de France. This was due to a urine sample that the French national anti-doping laboratory flagged after Landis had won stage \\(17\\) because it showed a high ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone. Because he was among the leaders he provided \\(8\\) pairs of urine samples – so there were \\(8\\) opportunities for a true positive and \\(8\\) opportunities for a false positive.\n\nAssume that the test has a specificity of \\(95\\)%. What’s the probability of all \\(8\\) samples being labeled “negative”?\nNow assume the specificity is \\(99\\)%. What’s the false positive rate for the test\nBased on this data, explain how you would assess the probability of guilt of Landis in a court hearing.\n\nSolution:\n\nWe’re given that \\(0.95= \\frac{ \\text{number of true negatives}}{\\text{number of true negatives + false positives}}.\\)    \\(P( \\text{8 negatives} | \\text{not guilty})= P(\\text{8 true negatives})=0.95^8\\).\nFalse Positive rate = \\(\\frac {\\text{False positives}}{\\text{False positives + True negatives}}=\\frac{1}{100}=0.01.\\)\n\\(P(8 negatives| \\text{not guilty})=P(\\text{8 true negatives})=0.95^8\\) (or \\(0.99^8\\) if we follow the part 2).  \\(P(\\text{at least 1 positive}|\\text{not guilty})=1-P(\\text{8 negatives}|\\text{not guilty})=1-0.95^8\\approx 0.34\\). Hence, if the specificity is 0.95, the chance of a false positive is 0.34, which is pretty large.\n\n\n\nExercise 27.50 (BRCA1) Approximately \\(1\\)% of woman aged \\(40-50\\) have breast cancer. A woman with breast cancer has a \\(90\\)% chance of a positive mammogram test and a \\(10\\)% chance of a false positive result. Given that someone has a positive test, what’s the posterior probability that they have breast cancer?\nIf you have the BRCA1 gene mutation, you have a \\(90\\)% chance of developing breast cancer. The prevalence of mutations at BRCA1 has been estimated to be 0.04%-0.20% in the general population. The genetic test for a mutation of this gene has a \\(99.9\\)% chance of finding the mutation. The false positive rate is unknown, but you are willing to assume its still \\(10\\)%.\nGiven that someone tests positive for the BRCA1 mutation, what’s the posterior probability that they have breast cancer?\nSolution: We know \\(P(C) = 0.01\\) and \\(P(T\\mid C) = 0.9\\), \\(P(T\\mid \\bar C) = 0.1\\), \\[\nP(C\\mid T) = \\frac{P(T\\mid C)P(C)}{P(T\\mid C)P(C) + P(T\\mid \\bar C)P(\\bar C)} = \\frac{0.9 \\times 0.01}{0.9 \\times 0.01 + 0.1 \\times 0.99} = 0.083\n\\]\n\n0.9*0.01/(0.9*0.01 + 0.1*0.99)\n\n 0.083\n\n\nFor part 2, we know \\(P(C\\mid B) = 0.9\\), \\(P(B) \\in [0.04,0.2]\\), \\(P(BT\\mid B) = 0.999\\), \\(P(BT\\mid \\bar B) = 0.1\\), then\n\\[\nP(C\\mid BT) = \\frac{P(BT, C)}{P(BT)}\n\\] We will do the calculation for the low-end of the BRCA1 mutation \\(P(B) = 0.0004\\) The total probability of a positive test is given by \\[\nP(BT) = P(BT\\mid B)P(B) + P(BT\\mid \\bar B)P(\\bar B) =  0.999*0.0004 + 0.1*0.9996 = 0.1003596\n\\]\nWe can calculate joint over \\(BT\\) and \\(C\\) by marginalizing \\(B\\) from the joint distribution of \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) and \\(BT\\). \\[\nP(BT,C,B) = P(BT\\mid B,C)P(B,C) = P(BT\\mid B)P(C\\mid B)P(B)\n\\] Here we used the fact that \\(BT\\) is conditionally independent of \\(C\\) given \\(B\\). Now we can marginalize over \\(B\\) to get \\[\nP(BT,C) = P(BT,C,\\bar B) + P(BT,C,B) = P(BT\\mid \\bar B)P(\\bar B)P(C\\mid \\bar B) + P(BT\\mid B)P(B)P(C\\mid B) = 0.1*0.9996*P(C\\mid \\bar B) + 0.999*0.0004*0.9\n\\] We can find \\(P(C\\mid \\bar B)\\) from the total probability \\[\nP(C) = P(C\\mid B)P(B) + P(C\\mid \\bar B)P(\\bar B) = 0.9*0.0004 + P(C\\mid \\bar B)*0.9996\n\\] \\[\nP(C\\mid \\bar B) = (0.01 - 0.9*0.0004)/0.9996 = 0.009643858\n\\] \\[\nP(BT,C)  = 0.1*0.9996*0.009643858 + 0.999*0.0004*0.9 = 0.00132364\n\\]\n\\[\nP(C\\mid BT) = \\frac{P(BT, C)}{P(BT)} = 0.00132364/0.1003596 = 0.01318897\n\\] A small probability of 1.32%.\nFor the high-end of the BRCA1 mutation \\(P(B) = 0.002\\), we get \\[\nP(C\\mid BT) = 0.02637794\n\\] Slightly large probability of 2.64%.\n\nPB = seq(0.0004,0.002, by = 0.0001)\nPCBT = 0.1*(1-PB)*(0.01 - 0.9*PB)/(1-PB) + 0.999*PB*0.9\nplot(PB,PCBT, type = \"l\", xlab = \"P(B)\", ylab = \"P(C|BT)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 27.51 (Another Cancer Test) Bayes is particularly useful when predicting outcomes that depend strongly on prior knowledge.\nSuppose that a woman is her forties takes a mammogram test and receives the bad news of a positive outcome. Since not every positive outcome is real, you assess the following probabilities. The base rate for a woman is her forties to have breast cancer is \\(1.4\\)%. The probability of a positive test given breast cancer is \\(75\\)% and the probability of a false positive is \\(10\\)%.\nGiven the positive test, what’s the probability that she has breast cancer?\n\n\nExercise 27.52 (Bayes Rule: Hit and Run Taxi) A certain town has two taxi companies: Blue Birds, whose cabs are blue, and Uber, whose cabs are black. Blue Birds has 15 taxis in its fleet, and Uber has 75. Late one night, there is a hit-and-run accident involving a taxi.\nThe town’s taxis were all on the streets at the time of the accident. A witness saw the accident and claims that a blue taxi was involved. The witness undergoes a vision test under conditions similar to those on the night in question. Presented repeatedly with a blue taxi and a black taxi, in random order, they successfully identify the colour of the taxi 4 times out of 5.\nWhich company is more likely to have been involved in the accident?\nSolution:\nWe need to know \\(P(Blue \\mid \\mbox{identified Blue})\\) and \\(P(Black \\mid \\mbox{identified Blue})\\).\nFirst of all, write down some probability statements given in the problem. \\(P(Blue) = 16.7\\% \\mbox{ and } P(Black) = 83.3\\%\\) \\[\nP(\\mbox{identified Blue} \\mid Blue) = 80\\% \\mbox{ and } P(\\mbox{identified Black} \\mid Blue) = 20\\%\n\\] \\[\nP(\\mbox{identified Black} \\mid Black) = 80\\% \\mbox{ and } P(\\mbox{identified Blue} \\mid Black) = 20\\%\n\\] Therefore, by Bayes Rule, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(Blue \\mid \\mbox{identified Blue}) =& \\frac{P(\\mbox{identified Blue} \\mid Blue)*P(Blue) }{P(\\mbox{identified Black})} \\\\\n=& \\frac{P(\\mbox{identified Blue} \\mid Blue)*P(Blue) }{P(\\mbox{identified Blue} \\mid Blue)*P(Blue) + P(\\mbox{identified Black} \\mid Black)*P(Black) }  \\\\\n=& 44.5\\%\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] \\[\nP(Black \\mid \\mbox{identified Blue}) = 1- P(Blue \\mid \\mbox{identified Blue}) = 55.5\\%\n\\]\nTherefore, even though the witness said it was a Blue car, the probability that it was a Black car is higher.\n\n\nExercise 27.53 (Gold and Silver Coins) A chest has two drawers. It is known that one drawer has \\(3\\) gold coins and no silver coins. The other drawer is known to contain \\(1\\) gold coin and \\(2\\) silver coins.\nYou don’t know which drawer is which. You randomly select a drawer and without looking inside you pull out a coin. It is gold. Show that the probability that the remaining two coins in the drawer are gold is \\(75\\)%.\nSolution:\nSuppose drawer A contains 3G and drawer B contains 1G2S. We know the probability \\(P(G \\mid A) = 1\\) and \\(P(G \\mid B) = 1/3\\). Also, it must be either of two drawers, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2. What we are looking for is \\(P(A \\mid G)\\): the probability that it is drawer A. By Bayes’ rule, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(A \\mid G) &=& \\frac{P(G \\mid A)\\times P(A)}{P(G)} \\\\\n&=& \\frac{P(G \\mid A)\\times P(A)}{P(G \\mid A)\\times P(A) + P(G \\mid B)\\times P(B)} \\mbox{ (Law of total probability)} \\\\\n&=& \\frac{1\\times \\frac{1}{2}}{1*\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}\\times\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] The probability that it is drawer A is 75%.\n\n\nExercise 27.54 (The Monty Hall Problem.) This problem is named after the host of the long-running TV show, Let’s Make a Deal. A contestant is given a choice of 3 doors. There is a prize (a car, say) behind one of the doors and something worthless behind the other two doors (say two goats).\nAfter the contestant chooses a door Monty opens one of the other two doors, revealing a goat. The contestant has the choice of switching doors. Is it advantageous to switch doors or not?\nSolution:\nSuppose you plan to switch:\nYou can either pick a winner, a loser, or the other loser when you make your first choice. Each of these options has a probability of \\(1/3\\) and are marked by a “1” below. In each case, Monty will reveal a loser (X). In the first case, he has a choice, but whichever he reveals, you will switch to the other and lose. But in the other two cases, there is only one loser for him to reveal. He must reveal this one, leaving only the winner. So, if you initially pick a loser, you will win by switching. That is, there is a \\(2/3\\) chance of winning if you use the switch strategy.\n\n\n\n\nW\nL\nL\n\n\n\n\n1/3\n1\nX\n\n\n\n1/3\n\n1\nX\n\n\n1/3\n\nX\n1\n\n\n\nNot convinced? Try thinking about it this way: Imagine the question with 1000 doors, and Monty will reveal 998 wrong doors after you pick one, so you are left with your choice, and one of the remaining 999 doors. Now do you want to stay or switch?\nAgain, suppose you are going to switch. Define the events\n\nW = the one you switch to is a winner\nFW = your first choice is a winner\nFL = your first choice is a loser\n\nSince you must pick either a winner or loser with your first choice, and cannot pick both, FW and FL are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. By the rule of total probability: \\[\nP(W) = P(W \\text{ and }FW) + P(W \\text{ and }FL) = P(W|FW)P(FW) + P(W|FL)P(FL)\n\\] \\[\nP(W) = 0 \\times \\frac{1}{3} + 1 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\] Why is \\(P(W\\mid FW)=0\\)? Because if we choose correctly, and we do switch, we must be on a loser.\nWhy is \\(P(W|FL)=1\\)? If we first picked a loser, and then switched, we will now have a winner. These both come from above.\nThere’s a longer explanation: Suppose you choose door A and Monty opens B.\nConsider the events\n\nA=prize is behind A\nB=prize is behind B\nC=prize is behind C\nMA=Monty opens A\nMB=Monty opens B\nMC=Monty Opens C\n\nBefore we choose, each door was equally likely: \\(P(A)=P(B)=P(C)=1/3\\).\nIn this case, we know Monty opened B. To decide whether to switch, we want to know if \\(P(A |MB)\\) and \\(P(C|MB)\\) are the same. If they are, then there is no gain in switching: \\[\nP(A|MB) = \\frac{P(A \\text{ and }MB)}{P(MB)} = \\frac{P(MB|A)P(A)}{P(MB)}\n\\] We need these components: \\(P(A)=1/3,~P(MB|A)=1/2\\). This is because you picked A, and Monty can open either B or C. He cannot open A. He can open B or C because the condition in this conditional probability is that the prize is actually behind A. \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(MB) & = P(MB \\text{ and }A) + P(MB \\text{ and }B) + P(MB \\text{ and }C)\\\\\n&= P(MB|A)P(A) + P(MB|B)P(B) + P(MB|C)P(C)\\\\\n& = \\frac{1}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{3} + 0\\times \\frac{1}{3} + 1\\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] I already showed that \\(Pr(MB\\)|A)=1/2$. We have that \\(Pr(MB|B)=0\\) because Monty cannot reveal B if this is where the prize is. If the prize is behind C, he must open B, since you have picked A.\nPutting it all together: \\(P(A|MB) = \\frac{P(MB|A)P(A)}{P(MB)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\times \\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\)\nSimilarly for C: \\(P(C|MB) = \\frac{P(MB|C)P(C)}{P(MB)} = \\frac{1\\times \\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{2}{3}\\)\nSo we are always better off switching$!\n\n\nExercise 27.55 (Medical Testing for HIV) A controversial issue in recent years has been the possible implementation of random drug and/or disease testing (e.g. testing medical workers for HIV virus, which causes AIDS). In the case of HIV testing, the standard test is the Wellcome Elisa test.\nThe test’s effectiveness is summarized by the following two attributes:\n\nThe sensitivity is about 0.993. That is, if someone has HIV, there is a probability of 0.993 that they will test positive.\nThe specificity is about 0.9999. This means that if someone doesn’t have HIV, there is probability of 0.9999 that they will test negative.\n\nIn the general population, incidence of HIV is reasonably rare. It is estimated that the chance that a randomly chosen person has HIV is \\(0.000025\\).\nTo investigate the possibility of implementing a random HIV-testing policy with the Elisa test, calculate the following:\n\nThe probability that someone will test positive and have HIV.\nThe probability that someone will test positive and not have HIV.\nThe probability that someone will test positive.\nSuppose someone tests positive. What is the probability that they have HIV?\n\nIn light of the last calculation, do you envision any problems in implementing a random testing policy?\nSolution:\nFirst, introduce some notation: let \\(H\\) = “Has HIV” and \\(T\\) = “Tests Positive”. We are given the following sensitivities and specificities \\[\nP(T|H) = 0.993 \\; \\; \\text{ and} \\; \\; P(\\bar{T}|\\bar{H}) = 0.9999\n\\] The base rate is \\(P(H) = 0.000025\\).\n\n\\(P(T \\text{ and }H) = P(T|H)P(H) = 0.993*0.000025 = 0.000024825\\)\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nP(T|\\bar{H})P(\\bar{H}) & = (1-P(\\bar{T}|\\bar{H}))(1-P(H))\\\\\n& = 0.0001 \\times 0.999975 = 0.0000999975\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\\(P(T) = P(T \\text{ and }H) + P(T \\text{ and }\\bar{H}) = 0.000024825 + 0.00009975 = 0.0001248225\\)\n\\(P(H|T) = \\frac{P(H \\text{ and }T)}{P(T)} = \\frac{0.000024825}{0.0001248225} = 0.1988\\)\n\nThis says that if you test positive, you have a 20% chance of having the disease. In other words, 80% of people who test positive will not have the disease. The large number of false positives means that implementing such a policy will be pretty unpopular among the people who have to be tested. Testing high risk people only might be a better idea, as this will increase the \\(P(H)\\) in the population.\n\n\nExercise 27.56 (The Three Prisoners) An unknown two will be shot, the other freed. Prisoner A asks the warder for the name of one other than himself who will be shot, explaining that as there must be at least one, the warder won’t really be giving anything away. The warder agrees, and says that B will be shot. This cheers A up a little: his judgmental probability for being shot is now 1/2 instead of 2/3.\nShow (via Bayes theorem) that\n\nA is mistaken - assuming that he thinks the warder is as likely to say \"C\" as \"B\" when he can honestly say either; but that\nA would be right, on the hypothesis that the warder will say \"B\" whenever he honestly can.\n\n\n\nExercise 27.57 (The Two Children) You meet Max walking with a boy whom he proudly introduces as his son.\n\nWhat is your probability that his other child is also a boy, if you regard him as equally likely to have taken either child for a walk?\nWhat would the answer be if you regarded him as sure to walk with the boy rather than the girl, if he has one of each?\nWhat would the answer be if you regarded him as sure to walk with the girl rather than the boy, if he has one of each?\n\n\n\nExercise 27.58 (Medical Exam) As a result of medical examination, one of the tests revealed a serious illness in a person. This test has a high precision of 99% (the probability of a positive response in the presence of the disease is 99%, the probability of a negative response in the absence of the disease is also 99%). However, the detected disease is quite rare and occurs only in one person per 10,000. Calculate the probability that the person being examined does have an identified disease.\n\n\nExercise 27.59 (The Jury) Assume that the probability is 0.95 that a jury selected to try a criminal case will arrive at the correct verdict whether innocent or guilty. Further, suppose that the 80% of people brought to trial are in fact guilty.\n\nGiven that the jury finds a defendant innocent what’s the probability that they are in fact innocent?\nGiven that the jury finds a defendant guilty what’s the probability that they are in fact guilty?\nDo these probabilities sum to one?\n\nSolution:\nLet \\(I\\) denote the event of innocence and let \\(VI\\) denote the event that the jury proclaims an innocent verdict.\n\nWe want \\(P(I|VI)\\) which is given by Bayes’ rule \\[\nP(I|VI)=\\frac{P(VI|I)P(I)}{P(VI)}\n\\] where, by the law of total probability \\(P(VI)=P(VI|I)P(I)+P(VI|\\bar{I})P(\\bar{I})\\) Hence \\(P(VI) =0.95\\cdot 0.2+0.05\\cdot 0.8=0.23\\) Hence \\(P(I|VI)=\\frac{0.95\\cdot 0.2}{0.23}=0.83\\)\nSimilarly \\[\nP(G|VG)=\\frac{P(VG|G)P(G)}{P(VG)}=\\frac{P(VG|G)P(G)}{1-P(VI)}=\\frac{%\n0.95\\cdot 0.8}{1-0.23}=0.99\n\\]\nNo. \\(P(I|VI)+P(G|{VG})\\neq 1\\) because they are conditioned on different events.\n\n\n\nExercise 27.60 (Oil company) An oil company has purchased an option on land in Alaska. Preliminary geologic studies have assigned the following probabilities of finding oil \\[\nP ( \\text{ high \\; quality \\; oil} ) = 0.50 \\; \\;\nP ( \\text{ medium \\; quality \\; oil} ) = 0.20 \\; \\;\nP ( \\text{ no \\; oil} ) = 0.30 \\; \\;\n\\] After 200 feet of drilling on the first well, a soil test is taken. The probabilities of finding the particular type of soil identified by the test are as follows: \\[\nP ( \\text{ soil} \\; | \\; \\text{ high \\; quality \\; oil} ) = 0.20 \\; \\;\nP ( \\text{ soil} \\; | \\; \\text{ medium \\; quality \\; oil} ) = 0.80 \\; \\;\nP ( \\text{ soil} \\; | \\; \\text{ no \\; oil} ) = 0.20 \\; \\;\n\\]\n\nWhat are the revised probabilities of finding the three different types of oil?\nHow should the firm interpret the soil test?\n\nSolution:\n\nUsing Bayes’ Theorem, we get \\[P ( \\text{ high \\; quality \\; oil} \\; | \\;  \\text{ soil}) =\n   \\frac{ P ( \\text{ soil} \\; | \\; \\text{ high \\; quality \\; oil} ) P ( \\text{ high \\; quality \\; oil} )}\n{ P ( \\text{ soil} ) }\\] Using the law of total probability \\[P ( \\text{ soil}) = 0.5 \\times 0.2 + 0.2 \\times 0.8 + 0.3 \\times 0.2 = 0.32\\] Hence \\[P ( \\text{ high \\; quality \\; oil} \\; | \\;  \\text{ soil}) =\n   \\frac{ 0.5 \\times 0.2}{ 0.32 } = 0.3125\\] Similarly \\[P ( \\text{ medium \\; quality \\; oil} \\; | \\;  \\text{ soil}) =\n   \\frac{ 0.8 \\times 0.2}{ 0.32 } = 0.50\\] \\[P ( \\text{ no \\; oil} \\; | \\;  \\text{ soil}) =\n   \\frac{ 0.3 \\times 0.2}{ 0.32 } = 0.1875\\]\nThe firm should interpret the soil test as increasing the probability of medium quality oil, but making both no oil and high quality oil less likely than their initial probabilities.\n\n\n\nExercise 27.61 A screening test for high blood pressure, corresponding to a diastolic blood pressure of \\(90\\)mm Hg or higher, produced the following probability table\n\n\n\n\nHypertension\n\n\n\n\n\nTest\nPresent\nAbsent\n\n\n+ve\n0.09\n0.03\n\n\n-ve\n0.03\n0.85\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s the probability that a random person has hypertension?\nWhat’s the probability that someone tests positive on the test?\nGiven a person who tests positive, what is the probability that they have hypertension?\nWhat would happen to your probability of having hypertension given you tested positive if you initially thought you had a \\(50\\)% chance of having hypertension.\n\nSolution:\n\n\\(P(H) = 0.09 + 0.03 = 0.12\\)\n\\(P(+)=0.09+0.03 =0.12\\)\n\\(P(H|+)=P(+|H)P(H)/P(+)= 0.09/0.12 = 0.75\\)\nNow you have to re-calculate \\(P(+) = P( +|H)P(H) + P( + | \\bar{H} )P( \\bar{H} )\n= 0.38\\). Then, by Bayes rule \\[P(H|+)= \\frac{P(+|H)P(H)}{P(+)} = \\frac{0.09 \\times 0.5}{0.38} = 0.99\\]\n\n\n\nExercise 27.62 (Steroids) Suppose that a hypothetical baseball player (call him “Rafael”) tests positive for steroids. The test has the following sensitivity and specificity\n\nIf a player is on Steroids, there’s a \\(95\\)% chance of a positive result.\nIf a player is clean, there’s a \\(10\\)% chance of a positive result.\n\nA respected baseball authority (call him “Bud”) claims that \\(1\\)% of all baseball players use Steroids. Another player (call him “Jose”) thinks that there’s a \\(30\\)% chance of all baseball players using Steroids.\n\nWhat’s Bud’s probability that Rafael uses Steroids?\nWhat’s Jose’s probability that Rafael uses Steroids?\n\nExplain any probability rules that you use.\nSolution:\nLet \\(T\\) and \\(\\bar{T}\\) be positive and negative test results. Let \\(S\\) and \\(\\bar{S}\\) be using and not using Steroids, respectively. We have the following conditional probabilities \\[\nP( T | S ) = 0.95 \\; \\; \\text{ and} \\; \\; P( T | \\bar{S} ) = 0.10\n\\] For our prior distributions we have \\(P_{ Bud } ( S  ) = 0.01\\) and \\(P_{ Jose } ( S  ) = 0.30\\).\nFrom Bayes rule and we have \\[\nP( S | T )  = \\frac{ P( T | S ) P( S )}{ P(T )}\n\\] and by the law of total probability \\[\nP(T)  = P( T| S) P(S) + P( T| \\bar{S} ) P( \\bar{S} )\n\\] Applying these two probability rules gives \\[\nP_{ Bud} ( S | T ) = \\frac{ 0.95 \\times 0.01 }{  0.95 \\times 0.01 + 0.10 \\times 0.99 } = 0.0876\n\\] and \\[\nP_{ Jose } ( S | T ) = \\frac{ 0.95 \\times 0.3 }{  0.95 \\times 0.3 + 0.10 \\times 0.7 } = 0.8028\n\\]\n\n\nExercise 27.63 A Breathalyzer test is calibrated so that if it is used on a driver whose blood alcohol concentration exceeds the legal limit, it will read positive \\(99\\)% of the time, while if the driver is below the limit it will read negative \\(90\\)% of the time. Suppose that based on prior experience, you have a prior probability that the driver is above the legal limit of \\(10\\)%.\n\nIf a driver tests positive, what is the posterior probability that they are above the legal limit?\nAt Christmas \\(20\\)% of the drivers on the road are above the legal limit. If all drivers were tested, what proportion of those testing positive would actually be above the limit\nHow does your answer to part \\(1\\) change. Explain\n\nSolution:\nLet the events be defined as follows:\n\nE - Alcohol concentration exceeds legal limit\nNE - Alcohol concentration does not exceed legal limit\nP - Breathalyser reads positive\nN - Breathalyser reads negative\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(P|E) & = & 0.99\\\\\nP(N|NE) & = & 0.90\\\\\nP(E) & = & 0.10\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nBased on above, we have \\(P(P|NE)=1-P(N|NE)=0.10\\) and \\(P(NE)=1-P(E)=0.90\\). Then,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(E|P) & = & \\frac{P(P|E)P(E)}{P(P)}\\\\\n& = & \\frac{P(P|E)P(E)}{P(P|E)P(E)+P(P|NE)P(NE)}\\\\\n& = & \\frac{0.99\\times0.10}{0.99\\times0.10+0.10\\times0.90}\\\\\n& = & 52.38\\%\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNow, we have \\(P(E)=0.20\\). Thus, \\(P(NE)=1-P(E)=0.80\\). We now calculate\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(E|P) & = & \\frac{P(P|E)P(E)}{P(P)}\\\\\n& = & \\frac{P(P|E)P(E)}{P(P|E)P(E)+P(P|NE)P(NE)}\\\\\n& = & \\frac{0.99\\times0.20}{0.99\\times0.20+0.10\\times0.80}\\\\\n& = & 71.22\\%\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThus, 71.22% of all the drivers who test positive would be above the legal limit.\nCompared to Part 1, the posterior probability increases due to the fact that the probability of a driver testing positive and exceeding the legal limit increases as does the probability of testing positive. However, the increase in the probability of testing positive and exceeding the legal limit is greater than the increase in the probability of testing positive which results in an increase in the posterior probability.\n\n\nExercise 27.64 (Chicago bearcats) The Chicago bearcats baseball team plays \\(60\\)% of its games at night and \\(40\\)% in the daytime. They win \\(55\\)% of their night games and only \\(35\\)% of their day games. You found out the next day that they won their last game\n\nWhat is the probability that the game was played at night\nWhat is the marginal probability that they will win their next game?\n\nExplain clearly any rules of probability that you use.\nSolution:\nWe have the following info:\n\n\\(P(Night) = 0.6, \\quad P(Day)=0.4\\)\n\\(P(Win|Night) = 0.55, \\quad P(Lose|Night)=0.45\\)\n\\(P(Win|Day) = 0.35, \\quad P(Lose|Day)=0.65\\)\n\n\n\\[P(Night|Win) = \\frac{P(Win|Night)P(Night)}{P(Win)}\\] \\[=\\frac{P(Win|Night)P(Night)}{P(Win|Day)P(Day)+P(Win|Night)P(Night)}\\] \\[\\frac{0.55*0.6}{0.35*0.4+0.55*0.6}=\\frac{0.33}{0.47}=0.7021\\]\n\\(P(Win) = P(Win|Day)P(Day)+P(Win|Night)P(Night)=0.35*0.4+0.55*0.6=0.47\\)\n\n\n\nExercise 27.65 (Spam Filter) Several spam filters use Bayes rule. Suppose that you empirically find the following probability table for classifying emails with the phrase “buy now” in their title as either “spam” or “not spam”.\n\n\n\n\nSpam\nNot Spam\n\n\n\n\n“buy now”\n0.02\n0.08\n\n\nnot “buy now”\n0.18\n0.72\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability that you will receive an email with spam?\nSuppose that you are given a new email with the phrase “buy now” in its title. What is the probability that this new email is spam?\nExplain clearly any rules of probability that you use.\n\nSolution:\n\nThe probability that you will receive an email with spam is: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nPr(Spam) = .02 + .18 = .2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe posterior probability is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nPr(Spam|buy \\; now) = \\frac{Pr(Spam\\;and\\;buy\\;now)}{Pr(buy\\;now)} = \\frac{.02}{.02+.08} = .2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe marginal probability is given by the law of total probability: \\(P( B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\\bar{A})P(\\bar{A})\\). We also use the definition of conditional probability (not Bayes’ rule) \\(Pr(A|B) = \\frac{Pr(A\\;and\\;B)}{Pr(B)}\\)\n\n\n\nExercise 27.66 (Chicago Cubs) The Chicago Cubs are having a great season. So far they’ve won \\(72\\) out of the \\(100\\) games played so far. You also have the expert opinion of Bob the sports analysis. He tells you that he thinks the Cubs will win. Historically his predictions have a \\(60\\)% chance of coming true.\n\nCalculate the probability that the Cubs will win given Bob’s prediction\nSuppose you now learn that it’s a home game and that the Cubs win \\(60\\)% of their games at Wrigley field. What’s you updated probability that the Cubs will win their game?\n\nSolution:\n\nFirst we have \\[\nP ( \\text{ Win} | \\text{ Bob} ) = \\frac{ 0.72 \\times 0.6}{ 0.72 \\times 0.6 + 0.28 \\times 0.4} = 0.79\n\\]\n\n\nLearning the new information, we use the previous posterior as a prior for the next Bayes update \\[\nP ( \\text{ Win} | \\text{ home} , \\text{ Bob}  ) = \\frac{ 0.79 \\times 0.60}{ 0.79 \\times 0.60 + 0.21 \\times 0.40} = 0.85\n\\] it’s highly likely that the Cubs will win!\n\n\n\nExercise 27.67 (Student-Grade Causality) Consider the following probabilistic model. The student does poorly in a class (\\(c = 1\\)) or well (\\(c = 0\\)) depending on the presence/absence of depression (\\(d = 1\\) or \\(d = 0\\)) and weather he/she partied last night (\\(v = 1\\) or \\(v = 0\\)) . Participation in the party can also lead to the fact that the student has a headache (\\(h = 1\\)). As a result of poor student’s performance, the teacher gets upset (\\(t = 1\\)). The probabilities are given by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(p(c=1|d,v)\\)\nv\nd\n\n\n\n\n0.999\n1\n1\n\n\n0.9\n1\n0\n\n\n0.9\n0\n1\n\n\n0.01\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(p(h=1|v)\\)\nv\n\n\n\n\n0.9\n1\n\n\n0.1\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(p(t=1|c)\\)\nc\n\n\n\n\n0.95\n1\n\n\n0.05\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(p(v=1)=0.2\\), and \\(p(d=1) = 0.4\\).\nDraw the causal relationships in the model. Calculate \\(p(v=1|h=1)\\), \\(p(v=1|t=1)\\), \\(p(v=1|t=1,h=1)\\).\n\n\nExercise 27.68 (Prisoner) An unknown two will be shot, the other freed. Prisoner A asks the warder for the name of one other than himself who will be shot, explaining that as there must be at least one, the warder won’t really be giving anything away. The warder agrees, and says that B will be shot. This cheers A up a little: his judgmental probability for being shot is now 1/2 instead of 2/3. Show (via Bayes theorem) that\n\nA is mistaken - assuming that he thinks the warder is as likely to say \"C\" as \"B\" when he can honestly say either; but that\nA would be right, on the hypothesis that the warder will say \"B\" whenever he honestly can.\n\nSolution:\n\n\nExercise 27.69 (True/False)  \n\nIn a sample of \\(100,000\\) emails you found that \\(550\\) are spam. Your next email contains the word “bigger”. From historical experience, you know that half of all spam email contains the word “bigger” and only \\(2\\)% of non-spam emails contain it. The probability that this new email is spam is approximately \\(12\\)%.\nSuppose that there’s a \\(5\\)% chance that it snows tomorrow and a \\(80\\)%chance that the Chicago bears play their football game tomorrow given that it snows. The probability that they play tomorrow is then \\(80\\)%.\nBayes’ rule states that \\(p(A|B) =p(B|A)\\).\nIf \\(P( A  \\text{ and }B ) = 0.4\\) and \\(P( B) = 0.8\\), then \\(P( A|B ) = 0.5\\).\n\nSolution:\n\nTrue. \\[P(bigger \\mid spam) = 50\\% \\mbox{ and } P(bigger \\mid non-spam) = 2\\%\\]\\[P(spam) = 0.55\\% \\mbox{ and } P(non-spam) = 99.45\\%\\]\\[\\begin{aligned}P(spam \\mid bigger) &=& \\frac{P(bigger \\mid spam)*P(spam)}{P(bigger \\mid spam)*P(spam) + P(bigger \\mid non-spam)*P(non-spam) } \\\\&=& 12.1\\%\\end{aligned}\\]\nFalse, 99% \\[P(Play) = P(Play|Snow)P(Snow) + P(Play|NoSnow)P(NoSnow)\\]\\[= 0.8*0.05+1*0.95=0.99\\]\nFalse. Recall Bayes’ rule:* \\[p(A|B)=\\frac{p(B|A)p(A)}{p(B)}\\]\nTrue. \\(P( A|B ) =  P( A  \\text{ and }B )/P(B)\\) by Bayes rule.",

    "text": "27.3 Utility and Decisions\n\nExercise 27.70 (Two Gambles) In an experiment, subjects were given the choice between two gambles:\n\n\n\nExperiment 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGamble \\({\\cal G}_A\\)\n\nGamble \\({\\cal G}_B\\)\n\n\n\nWin\nChance\nWin\nChance\n\n\n$2500\n0.33\n$2400\n1\n\n\n$2400\n0.66\n\n\n\n\n$0\n0.01\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that a person is an expected utility maximizer. Set the utility scale so that u($0) = 0 and u($2500) = 1. person is an expected utility maximizer. Set the utility scale so that u($0) = 0 and u($2500) = 1. Whether a utility maximizing person would choose Option A or Option B depends on the person’s utility for $2400. For what values of u($2400) would a rational person choose Option A? For what values would a rational person choose Option B?\n\n\n\nExperiment 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGamble \\({\\cal G}_C\\)\n\nGamble \\({\\cal G}_D\\)\n\n\n\nWin\nChance\nWin\nChance\n\n\n$2500\n0.33\n$2400\n0.34\n\n\n$0\n0.67\n$0\n0.66\n\n\n\nFor what values of u($2400) would a person choose Option C? For what values would a person choose Option D? Explain why no expected utility maximizer would prefer B and C.\nThis problem is a version of the famous Allais paradox, named after the prominent critic of subjective expected utility theory who first presented it. Kahneman and Tversky found that 82% of subjects preferred B over A, and 83% preferred C over D. Explain why no expected utility maximizer would prefer both B in Gamble 1 and C in Gamble 2. (A utility maximizer might prefer B in Gamble 1. A different utility maximizer might prefer C in Gamble 2. But the same utility maximizer would not prefer both B in Gamble 1 and C in Gamble\nDiscuss these results. Why do you think many people prefer B in Gamble 1 and C in Gamble 2? Do you think this is reasonable even if it does not conform to expected utility theory?\nSolution:\nDefine x = u($2400), the utility of $2400.\nFor A versus B:\n\nExpected utility of A is 0.33* (1) + 0.66(x) + 0.1(0)\nExpected utility of B is x\n\nSetting them equal and solving for x tells us the value of x for which an expected utility maximizer would be indifferent between the two options \\[0.33* (1) + 0.66*(x) + 0.1*(0) = x\\] \\[x = 0.33/0.34.\\]\nFor C versus D:\n\nExpected utility of C is 0.33* (1) + 0.67*(0)\nExpected utility of D is 0.34*(x)\n\nSetting them equal and solving for x tells us the value of x for which an expected utility maximizer would be indifferent between the two options \\[0.33* (1) = 0.34*(x)\\] \\[x = 0.33/0.34\\]\nIf x &lt; 33/34, then an expected utility maximizer would choose option C. If x&gt;33/34, option D an expected utility maximizer would choose option D\nWhy no utility maximizer would prefer B and C?\nA utility maximizer would pick B if x&gt;33/34, and would pick C if x&lt;33/34. These regions do not overlap. By definition, an expected utility maximizer has a consistent utility value for a given payout regardless of the probability structure. Therefore, no utility maximizer would prefer B and C. A utility maximizer would be indifferent among all four of these gambles if x = 33/34. But no utility maximizer would strictly prefer B over A, and C over D.\nMany people’s choices violate subjective expected utility theory in this problem. In fact, Allais carefully crafted this problem to exploit what Kahneman and Tversky called the “certainty effect.” In the choice of A vs B, many prefer a sure gain to a small chance of no gain. On the other hand, in the choice of C vs D, there is no certainty, and so people are willing to reduce their chances of winning by what feels like a small amount to give themselves a chance to win a larger amount. When given an explanation for why these choices are inconsistent with “economic rationality,” some people say they made an error and revise their choices, but others stand firmly by their choices and reject expected utility theory.\nIt is also interesting to look at how people respond to a third choice:\nExperiment 3:\nThis is a two-stage problem. In the first stage there is a 66% chance you will win nothing and quit. There is a 34% chance you will go on to the second stage. In the second stage you may choose between the following two options.\n\n\n\nGamble\nPayout\nProbability\n\n\n\n\nE\n$2500\n33/34\n\n\nE\n$0\n1/34\n\n\nF\n$2400\n1\n\n\nF\n$0\n1/34\n\n\n\nExperiment 3 is mathematically equivalent to Experiment 2. That is, the probability distributions of the outcomes for E and C are the same, and the probability distributions of the outcomes for F and D are the same. In experiments, the most common pattern of choices on these problems is to prefer B, C, and F. There is an enormous literature on the Allais paradox and related ways in which people systematically violate the principles of expected utility theory. For more information see Wikipedia on Allais paradox.\n\n\nExercise 27.71 (Decisions) You are sponsoring a fund raising dinner for your favorite political candidate. There is uncertainty about the number of people who will attend (the random variable \\(X\\)), but based on past dinners, you think that the probability function looks like this:\n\n\n\n\\(x\\)\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n\n\n\n\n\\(P_X(x)\\)\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.2\n0.2\n\n\n\n\nCalculate \\(E(X)\\), the expected number of people who will attend.\nThe owner of the venue is going to charge you $1500 for rental and other miscellaneous costs. You know that you will make a profit (after per person costs) of $40 for each person attending. Calculate the expected profit after the rental cost.\nThe owner of the venue proposes an alternative pricing scheme. Instead of charging $1500, she will charge you either $5 per person or $2100, whichever is smaller. So if 100 people come, you only pay $500. If 500 come, you pay $2100. Calculate the expected profit under this scheme (still assuming $40 per plate profit before you pay the owner).\nLet \\(Y_1\\) be your profit under the first scheme and \\(Y_2\\) be your profit under the second. If you do the calculations, it turns out that the standard deviations of these profits are: \\[\\sigma_{Y_1} = 4996 \\qquad \\sigma_{Y_2} = 4488\\] Using the expected values calculated above explain which of the two scenarios you prefer.\n\nSolution:\n\n\\(E(X) = 100(.1) + 200(.2) + 300(.3) + 400(.2) +500(.2) = 320\\)\n\\(Y=40X-1500\\) \\(E(Y) = E(40X-1500) = 40 E(X) -1500  = 40(320) -1500 = 11300\\)\nProfit = \\(40X - \\min(2100, 5X)\\). Note that the profit formula is not linear (just like in the newspaper example). Consequently, you need to re-calculate profit for each of the five cases to get the expected value.\n\n\n\n\\(x\\)\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n\n\n\n\n\\(p_X(x)\\)\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.2\n0.2\n\n\ncosts\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2100\n\n\ngross\n4000\n8000\n12000\n16000\n20000\n\n\nprofit = gross – costs\n3500\n7000\n10500\n14000\n17900\n\n\n\n\\(E(profit) = 3500(.1) + 7000(.2) + 10500(.3) + 14000(.2) + 17900(.2)\n= 11280\\)\nThe profit and standard deviation are larger in (b) than in (c). If you are risk averse, go for (c) (less uncertainty). If you are a gambler, go for (b) (higher average return). Since the difference in \\(\\sigma\\) is larger than in the mean.\n\n\n\nExercise 27.72 (Marjorie Visit) Marjorie is worried about whether it is safe to visit a vulnerable relative during a pandemic. She is considering whether to take an at-home test for the virus before visiting her relative. Assume the test has sensitivity 85% and specificity 92%. That is, the probability that the test will be positive is about 85% if an individual is infected with the virus, and the probability that test will be negative is about 92% if an individual is not infected.\nFurther, assume the following losses for Marjorie\n\n\n\nEvent\nLoss\n\n\n\n\nVisit relative, not infected\n0\n\n\nVisit relative, infected\n100\n\n\nDo not visit relative, not infected\n1\n\n\nDo not visit relative, infected\n5\n\n\n\n\nAssume that about 2 in every 1,000 persons in the population is currently infected. What is the posterior probability that an individual with a positive test has the disease?\nSuppose case counts have decreased substantially to about 15 in 100,000. What is the posterior probability that an individual with a positive test has the disease?\nSuppose Marjorie is deciding whether to visit her relative and if so whether to test for the disease before visiting. If the prior probability that Marjorie has the disease is 200 in 100,000, find the policy that minimizes expected loss. That is, given each of the possible test results, should Marjorie visit her relative? Find the EVSI. Repeat for a prior probability of 15 in 100,000. Discuss.\nFor the decision of whether Marjorie should visit her relative, find the range of prior probabilities for which taking the at-home test results in lower expected loss than ignoring or not taking the test (assuming the test is free). Discuss your results.\n\nSolution:\n\nFor a person in the given population, we have the following probabilities for the test outcome:\n\n\n\n\nCondition\nPositive\nNegative\n\n\n\n\nDisease present\n0.85\n0.15\n\n\nDisease absent\n0.08\n0.92\n\n\n\nPrior Probability: P(Disease present) = 0.002 and P(Disease absent)=0.998\nWe can calculate the posterior probability that the individual has the disease as follows:\nFirst, we calculate the probability of a positive test (this will be the denominator of Bayes Rule):\nP(Positive) = P(Positive | Present) * P(Present)+P(Positive | Absent) * P(Absent) = \\(0.85\\times 0.002 + 0.08\\times 0.998 = 0.08154\\)\nThen, we calculate the posterior probability that the individual is has the disease by applying Bayes rule:\nP(Present | Positive) = P(Positive | Present) * P(Present)/P(Positive) = 0.85 * 0.002/0.08154 = 0.0208\nThe posterior probability that an individual who tests positive has the disease is 0.0208.\n\nThe sensitivity and specificity of the test are the same as above:\n\n\n\n\nCondition\nPositive\nNegative\n\n\n\n\nDisease present\n0.85\n0.15\n\n\nDisease absent\n0.08\n0.92\n\n\n\nBut the prior probability is different:\nP(Disease present) = 0.00015 and P(Disease absent)=0.99985\nAgain, we calculate the probability of a positive test (this will be the denominator of Bayes Rule):\nP(Positive) = P(Positive | Present) * P(Present)+P(Positive | Absent) * P(Absent) = 0.85 * 0.00015 + 0.08 * 0.99985 = 0.0801155\nThen, we calculate the posterior probability that the individual is has the disease by applying Bayes rule:\nP(Present | Positive) = P(Positive | Present) * P(Present)/P(Positive) = 0.85 * 0.00015/0.0801155 = 0.00159\nThe posterior probability that an individual who tests positive has the disease is 0.00159.\nIn both cases, the posterior probability that the individual has the disease is small, even after taking the at-home test. But it is important to note that the probability has increased by more than a factor of 10, from 2 in 1000 to more than 2% in the first case, and from 15 in 100,000 to more than 15 in 10,000 in the second case. When the prior probability is lower, so is the posterior probability.\nSome students who are inexperienced with Bayesian reasoning are surprised at how small the posterior probability is after a positive test. Untrained people often expect the probability to be closer to 85%, the sensitivity of the test. I have found that a good way to explain these results to people who have trouble with it is to ask them to imagine a population of 100,000 people. For part a, we would expect 200 have the disease. Of these, we expect about 85%, or 170 people, to test positive, and 15%, or only 30 people, to test negative. So the test identified most of the ill people. But now let’s consider the 99,800 people who do not have the disease. We expect only 8% of these to test positive, but this is 7984 people testing positive. We expect 92%, or 91,816 people, to test negative. Of those who test positive, 170 have the disease and 7,984 do not. So even though most ill people test positive and most well people test negative, because there are so many more people who do not have the disease, most of the ones testing positive actually do not have the disease.\nA helpful way to visualize the role of the prior probability is to plot the posterior probability as a function of the prior probability (this was not required as part of the assignment). For prior probabilities near zero, a positive test increases the probability of the disease, but it remains very low because the positives are dominated by false positives. But once the prior probability reaches 10%, there is a better than even chance that someone testing positive has the disease; at a 20% prior probability, the posterior probability is over 70%.\n\np = seq(0.0001, 0.2, length.out = 100)\nposterior = 0.85*p/(0.85*p + 0.08*(1-p))\nplot(p, posterior, type = \"l\", xlab = \"Prior Probability\", ylab = \"Posterior Probability\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will consider two different prior probabilities:\n\nHigh prevalence: P(Present) = 0.002 and P( Absent ) = 0.998\nLow prevalence: P(Present) = 0.00015 and P( Absent ) = 0.99985\nTo calculate EVSI, we do the following:\nCalculate the expected loss if we do not do the test. To do this, we use the prior probability to calculate the expected loss if we visit and if we don’t. The minimum of these is the expected loss if we do not do the test.\nEL[visit] = 100p + 0(1-p)\nEL[no visit] = 5p + 1(1-p)\nHere, p is either 0.002 (part a) or 0.00015 (part b)\nCalculate the expected loss if we do the test as follows:\n\nAssume the test is positive. Using the posterior probability of disease, calculate the expected loss of visiting and not visiting. The minimum of these is the expected loss if the test is positive.\nAssume the test is negative. Using the posterior probability of disease, calculate the expected loss of visiting and not visiting. The minimum of these is the expected loss if the test is negative.\nUse the Law of Total Probability to find the probability of a positive test. (We already found this in Problems 1 and 2 - it’s the denominator of Bayes Rule.) Combine the results from a and b using the probability of disease as follows:\nE(L | test) = P(positive)E(L | positive)+P(negative)E(L | negative)\n\nNow, the EVSI is how much doing the test reduces our expected loss:\nEVSI = E(L | no test) - E(L | test)\nWe will now apply these steps for the two base rates. The table below shows the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh prevalence\nLow prevalence\n\n\n\n\nProbability of positive test\n0.08154\n0.08012\n\n\nPosterior probability of disease given positive test\n0.0208\n0.00159\n\n\nPosterior probability of disease given negative test\n0.00033\n0.0000245\n\n\nExpected loss - no test\nVisit: 0.2 No visit: 1.008\nVisit: 0.015 No visit: 1.0006\n\n\nExpected loss if positive\nVisit: 2.0849 No visit: 1.0834\nVisit: 0.15915 No visit: 1.00637\n\n\nExpected loss if negative\nVisit: 0.03266 No visit: 1.00131\nVisit: 0.00245 No visit: 1.0001\n\n\nExpected loss with test\n0.11834\n0.015\n\n\nExpected loss - no test\nVisit: 0.2 No visit: 1.008\nVisit: 0.015 No visit: 1.0006\n\n\nEVSI\n0.2-0.11834 = 0.08166\n0.015-0.015 = 0\n\n\n\nIn the high prevalence case, it is better to test and follow the test result. The EVSI is 0.08166; there is 0.08166 lower loss from testing than from not testing. In the low prevalence case, however, the optimal decision is to visit no matter what the result of the test, because the posterior probability is so low even if the test is positive. Therefore, the expected loss is the same for doing or not doing the test because we ignore the test result and visit anyway. Therefore, the EVSI is zero in the low prevalence case.\n\nPrior Probability: P(Disease present) = p and P( Disease absent ) = 1- p\n\nIf we do not do the test, we cannot use the test result, so we have two choices: visit or do not visit. The expected loss of visiting is: E(L|V) = 100p + 0(1-p) = 100p\nThe expected loss of not visiting (lose 5 if ill, 1 if not ill): E(L|N) = 5p + (1-p)\nNow consider the strategy of doing the test and visiting if the test is negative. We get the following losses\n\n\n\nPatient status\nTest result\nAction\nLoss (L)\nProbability\n\n\n\n\nNo disease\nNegative\nvisit\n0\n(1-p)*0.92\n\n\nNo disease\nPositive\nno visit\n1\n(1-p)*0.08\n\n\nDisease\nNegative\nvisit\n100\np*0.15\n\n\nDisease\nPositive\nno visit\n5\np*0.85\n\n\n\nThe total expected loss of this strategy is:\nE(L|T) = 0 + 10.08(1-p) + 1000.15p + 5*0.85p = 0.08 + 19.17p\nFind strategy regions. With a little algebra, we can find where the lines intersect and then find the regions of optimality. These are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRange\nPolicy\n\n\n\n\n\\(0 \\le p &lt; 0.00099\\)\nOptimal policy is visit regardless of test\n\n\n\\(0.00099 &lt; p &lt; 0.0606\\)\nOptimal policy is to do the test and visit if negative\n\n\n\\(0.0606 &lt; p \\le 1\\)\nOptimal policy is to stay home regardless of test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph below shows the plots of expected loss for the three policies. I show results only for probabilities up to 0.1 in order to have a better view of the results for small probabilities.\n\np = seq(0.0001, 0.1, length.out = 100)\nELV = 100*p\nELN = 5*p + (1-p)\nELT = 0.08 + 19.17*p\nplot(p, ELV, type = \"l\", xlab = \"Prior Probability\", ylab = \"Expected Loss\", col = \"red\", lwd = 2)\nlines(p, ELN, col = \"blue\", lwd = 2)\nlines(p, ELT, col = \"green\", lwd = 2)\nlegend(\"topright\", legend = c(\"Visit\", \"No Visit\", \"Test and Visit if Negative\"), col = c(\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\"), lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, in the range of values 0.00099 &lt; p &lt; 0.0606, doing the test has lower expected loss than either just visiting or just staying home. For the high prevalence situation, the prior probability of 0.002 is larger than 0.00099 and lower than 0.0606, so it is optimal to take the test and follow the result. For the low prevalence situation, the prior probability of 0.00015 is below 0.00099, and it is optimal just to visit without considering the test. That is, in very low prevalence situations, there is no point in doing the test, because even if it is positive, the posterior probability would still be low enough that it is optimal to visit. On the other hand, if Marjorie is experiencing symptoms or knows she has been exposed, that would increase the probability of having the disease. Even in a low prevalence situation, if symptoms or exposure increase the prior probability to above 0.00099 but below 0.0606, then she should take the test and follow the result. If symptoms or exposure increase the prior probability to above 0.0606, then she should not bother with the test and just stay home.\n\n\nExercise 27.73 (True/False Variance)  \n\nIf the sample covariance between two variables is one, then there must be a strong linear relationship between the variables\nIf the sample covariance between two variables is zero, then the variables are independent.\nIf \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent random variables, then \\(Var(2X-Y)= 2 Var(X)-Var(Y)\\).\nThe sample variance is unaffected by outlying observations.\nSuppose that a random variable \\(X\\) can take the values \\(\\{0,1,2\\}\\) all with equal probability. Then the expected and variance of \\(X\\) are both\\(1\\).\nThe maximum correlation is \\(1\\) and the minimum is \\(0\\).\nFor independent random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), we have \\(var(X-Y)=var(X)-var(Y)\\).\nIf the correlation between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is zero then the standard deviation of \\(X+Y\\) is the square root of the sum of the standard deviations of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\nIt is always true that the standard deviation is less than the variance\nIf the correlation between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is \\(r = - 0.81\\) and if the standard deviations are \\(s_X = 20\\) and \\(s_Y = 25\\), respectively, then the covariance is \\(Cov (X, Y) = - 401\\).\nIf we drop the largest observation from a sample, then the sample mean and variance will both be reduced.\nSuppose \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent random variables and \\(Var(X) = 6\\) and \\(Var(Y) = 6\\). Then \\(Var(X+Y) = Var(2X)\\).\nLet investment \\(X\\) have mean return 5% and a standard deviation of 5%and investment \\(Y\\) have a mean return of 10% with a standard deviation of 6%. Suppose that the correlation between returns is zero. Then I can find a portfolio with higher mean and lower variance then \\(X\\).\n\nSolution:\n\nFalse. \\(Cov(X,Y) = Corr(X,Y) \\sqrt{Var(X)*Var(Y)}\\), so knowing \\(Cov(X,Y) = 1\\) doesn’t inform you about the correlation.\nFalse. This is only a special case for normal distribution.\nFalse. \\(Var(2X-Y) = 4Var(X) + Var(Y)\\)\nFalse. We have the following formula for the sample variance: \\[\\begin{aligned}\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\\bar{x})^2\\end{aligned}\\]If \\(x_i\\) is large relative to \\(\\bar{x}\\) then it has an undue influence.\nFalse \\[E[X] = \\frac{1}{3}*0+\\frac{1}{3}*1+\\frac{1}{3}*2=1\\]\\[Var[X] = \\frac{1}{3}(0-1)^2+\\frac{1}{3}(1-1)^2+\\frac{1}{3}(2-1)^2\\]\\[=\\frac{1}{3}+0+\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{2}{3}\\]\nFalse, the maximum is 1 and the minimum in -1.\nFalse. \\(Var(X-Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y)\\)\nFalse. Using the plug in rule, the standard deviation of \\(X + Y\\) is the square root of the sum of the variances of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)\nFalse. \\(s_X \\geq Var(X)\\) if the \\(Var (X ) \\leq 1\\)\nFalse. Using the formula relating covariance and correlation, namely\\(Cov( X, Y ) = r s_X s_Y\\) gives\\(Cov ( X,Y) = - 0.81 \\times 20 \\times 25 = - 405.\\)\nFalse. For example, \\(100, 101, 102\\) has mean \\(101\\) and variance \\(0.333\\),but \\(100, 101\\) has mean \\(100.5\\) and variance \\(0.5\\)\nFalse. First, \\(Var(X+Y)=Var(X)+Var(Y)\\) (as \\(Cov(X,Y)=0)\\) and so \\(Var(X+Y)=2 Var(X)\\). Secondly \\(Var(2X) = 4 Var(X)\\)\nTrue. For example, consider the portfolio \\(P=  0.5 X + 0.5 Y\\). This has expected return \\(\\mu_P = 0.5\\times 5 + 0.5 \\times 0.10 = 7.5 \\%\\). As the correlation is zero, its variance is given by \\(\\sigma_P^2 =0.5^2 \\times 0.0025 + 0.5^2  0.0036 = 0.001525 &lt; Var(X)\\)\n\n\n\nExercise 27.74 (True/False Expectation)  \n\nLeBron James makes \\(85\\)% of his free throw attempts and \\(50\\)% of his regular shots from the field (field goals). Suppose that each shot is independent of the others. He takes \\(20\\) field goals and \\(10\\) free throws in a typical game. He gets one point for each free throw and two points for each field goal assuming no 3-point shots. The number of points he expects to score in a game is 28.5.\nSuppose that you have a one in a hundred chance of hitting the jackpot on a slot machine. If you play the machine \\(100\\) times then you are certain to win.\nThe expected value of the sample mean is the population mean, that is \\(E \\left ( \\bar{X} \\right ) = \\mu\\).\nThe expectation of \\(X\\) minus \\(2Y\\) is just the expectation of \\(X\\) minus twice the expectation of \\(Y\\), that is \\(E (X-2Y)= E(X) - 2E (Y)\\).\nA firm believes it has a 50-50 chance of winning a $80,000 contract if it spends $5,000 on a proposal. If the firm spends twice this amount,it feels its chances of winning improve to 60%. If the firm wants to maximize its expected value then it should spend $10,000 to try and gain the contract.\n\\(E(X+Y)=E(X)+E(Y)\\) only if the random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent.\n\nSolution:\n\nTrue.\\[E(points) = 2E(\\# FG made) + 1E(\\#FT made) = 2 \\times 20 \\times 0.5+1 \\times 10 \\times 0.85 = 28.5\\]This holds even if FG and FT are dependent\nFalse. The expected waiting time until you hit the jackpot is 100 times,but since each outcome of the game is independent of all previous outcomes, there is no guarantee about the number of plays until a jackpot it hit\nTrue. The expected value of the sample does equal the true value\nTrue. The plug-in rule states that \\(E(aX+bY)=aE(X)+bE(Y)\\). Plug in \\(A=1\\)and \\(B =-2\\). Hence \\(E(X-2Y)=E(X)+E(-2Y)=E(X)-2E(Y)\\)\nTrue. \\(E(spend \\$5k) = 0.5\\cdot\\$80000 - 5000 = 35000\\). \\(E(spend \\$10k) = 0.6\\cdot 80000 - 10000 = 38000\\)\nFalse. By the plug-in rule, this relation holds irrespective of whether X and Y are.",

    "text": "27.4 Bayesian Parameter Learning\n\nExercise 27.75 (Beta-Binomial for Allais gambles) We’ve collected data on people’s preferences in the two Allais gambles from. For this problem, we will assume that responses are independent and identically distributed, and the probability is \\(\\theta\\) that a person chooses both B in the first gamble and C in the second gamble.\n\nAssume that the prior distribution for \\(\\theta\\) is Beta(1, 3). Find the prior mean and standard deviation for \\(\\theta\\). Find a 95% symmetric tail area credible interval for the prior probability that a person would choose B and C. Do you think this is a reasonable prior distribution to use for this problem? Why or why not?\nIn 2009, 19 out of 47 respondents chose B and C. Find the posterior distribution for the probability \\(\\theta\\) that a person in this population would choose B and C.\nFind the posterior mean and standard deviation. Find a 95% symmetric tail area credible interval for \\(\\theta\\).\nMake a triplot of the prior distribution, normalized likelihood, and posterior distribution.\nComment on your results.\n\nSolution:\nPart a. It is convenient to use a prior distribution in the Beta family because it is conjugate to the Binomial likelihood function, which simplifies Bayesian updating. A plot of the prior density function is shown below.\n\ncurve(dbeta(x,1,3),0,1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prior distribution has mean \\(\\alpha/(\\alpha+\\beta) = 0.25\\) and standard deviation \\[\n\\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\alpha\\beta}{(\\alpha+\\beta)^2(\\alpha+\\beta+1)}} = 0.194.\n\\] An expected value of 0.25 would be reasonable if we believed that people were choosing randomly among the four options A&C, B&C, A&D, and B&D. In fact, a Beta(1,3) distribution is the marginal distribution we would obtain if we placed a uniform distribution on all probability vectors \\((p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4)\\) on the four categories (i.e. a uniform distribution on four non-negative numbers that sum to 1). In other words, this is the prior distribution we might assign if all we knew was that there were four possible responses, and knew nothing about the relative likelihoods of the four responses. However, we actually do know something about the relative probabilities of the categories. According to the research literature, people choose B&C more often than 25% of the time. The center of the prior distribution does not reflect this knowledge. But the prior distribution does show a very high degree of uncertainty about the probability. A 95% symmetric tail area credible interval for the prior distribution of \\(\\Theta\\) is [0.008, 0.708]. The virtual count is small in relation to the sample size, so the data will have a large impact on the posterior distribution relative to the prior. Therefore, we won’t go too far wrong using this prior distribution, even though we do have knowledge that suggests the prior mean is likely to be higher than 0.25.\nPart b. We will use the Binomial/Beta conjugate pair. The prior distribution is a member of the conjugate Beta\\((\\alpha, \\beta)\\) family, with \\(\\alpha=1\\) and \\(\\beta=3\\). Therefore, the posterior distribution is a Beta\\((\\alpha^*, \\beta^*)\\) distribution, with \\(\\alpha^*=\\alpha+x= 1+19 = 20\\), and \\(\\beta^*=\\beta+n-x = 3+28 = 31\\). The posterior distribution is shown below.\n\ncurve(dbeta(x,20,31),0,1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart c. The posterior mean is \\(\\alpha^*/(\\alpha^*+\\beta^*) = 20/51 = 0.392\\). The posterior standard deviation is \\[\n\\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\alpha^*\\beta^*}{(\\alpha^*+\\beta^*)^2(\\alpha^*+\\beta^*+1)}} = 0.077.\n\\] A 95% symmetric tail area credible interval for the posterior distribution of \\(\\Theta\\) is [0.248, 0.536].\n\nqbeta(c(0.025,0.975),20,31)\n\n 0.26 0.53\n\n\nPart d. The triplot is shown below.\n\ncurve(dbeta(x,1,3),0,1,ylab=\"Density\",lty=2,xlim=c(0,1),ylim=c(0,6))\ncurve(dbeta(x,20,31),0,1,add=TRUE)\ncurve(dbeta(x,19,47-19),0,1,add=TRUE)       # Normalized Likelihood is Beta(x,n-x)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe triplot shows the prior, normalized likelihood, and posterior distributions. The normalized likelihood is a Beta(19,47-19) density function. The posterior distribution is focused on slightly smaller values and is slightly narrower than the normalized likelihood. This is because the prior mean is smaller than the sample mean, and the posterior distribution has slightly more information than the prior distribution.\n\n\nExercise 27.76 (Poisson for Car Counts) Times were recorded at which vehicles passed a fixed point on the M1 motorway in Bedfordshire, England on March 23, 1985.2 The total time was broken into 21 intervals of length 15 seconds. The number of cars passing in each interval was counted. The result was:\n\ncnt = c(2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 4, 3, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 2)\n\nThis can be summarized in the following table, that shows 3 intervals with zero cars, 5 intervals with 1 car, 7 intervals with 2 cars, 3 intervals with 3 cars and 3 intervals with 4 cars.\n\ntable(cnt)\n\ncnt\n0 1 2 3 4 \n3 5 7 3 3 \n\n\n\nDo you think a Poisson distribution provides a good model for the count data? Justify your answer.\nAssume that \\(\\Lambda\\), the rate parameter of the Poisson distribution for counts (and the inverse of the mean of the exponential distribution for inter arrival times), has a discrete uniform prior distribution on 20 equally spaced values between \\((0.2, 0.4,\\ldots 3.8, 4.0)\\) cars per 15-second interval. Find the posterior distribution of \\(\\Lambda\\).\nFind the posterior mean and standard deviation of \\(\\Lambda\\).\nDiscuss what your results mean in terms of traffic on this motorway.\n\nSolution:\n\nA Poisson distribution is a good model to consider for the arrival counts because:\n\nThe data consist of counts of discrete events.\nIt seems reasonable that the events would be independent.\nIt seems reasonable that the rate of occurrence would remain constant over the 4+ minutes that the sample was taken.\n\n\nThese are reasons to consider a Poisson distribution, but we still need to investigate how well a Poisson distribution fits the observations. We will do this by comparing the sample frequencies with Poisson probability mass function. To do this, we need to estimate the mean of the distribution. We calculate the sample mean by summing these observations (40 total cars passing) and dividing by the number of intervals (21), to obtain an estimated arrival rate of about 1.9 cars per 15 second time interval.\nNext, we use the Poisson probability mass function \\(f(x|\\Lambda=1.9) = e^{-1.9} (1.9)^x / x!\\) to estimate the probability of each number of cars in a single interval, and multiply by 21 to find the expected number of times each value occurs (Note: for the 5 or more entry, we use \\(1-F(4|\\Lambda=1.9)\\), or 1 minus the Poisson cdf at 4. The probability of more than 5 cars in 15 seconds is very small.) The expected counts are:\n\nd = data.frame(cars=0:5,sample=c(3,5,7,3,3,0),expected=c(21*dpois(0:4,1.9),ppois(4,1.9)))\nprint(d)\n\n  cars sample expected\n1    0      3     3.14\n2    1      5     5.97\n3    2      7     5.67\n4    3      3     3.59\n5    4      3     1.71\n6    5      0     0.96\n\n\nThe values in this table seem to show fairly good agreement. We can do a visual inspection by drawing a bar chart, shown below. The bar chart shows good agreement between the empirical and the Poisson probabilities.\n\nbarplot(height = t(as.matrix(d[,2:3])),beside=TRUE,legend=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also perform a Pearson chi-square test (this is not required). The test statistic is calculated as: \\[\n\\chi^2 =\\sum_i (Y_i -E_i)^2/E_i\n\\] where \\(Y_i\\) is the observed count for i cars passing, and \\(E_i\\) is the expected number of instances of i cars passing in a sample of size 21. The chi-square test should not be applied when counts are very small. A common (and conservative) rule of thumb is to avoid using the chi-square test if any cell has an expected count less than 5. Other less conservative rules have been proposed.4 We will combine the last two categories to increase the expected count to 2.37. To find the expected counts in this last category, we assign it probability 1 minus the cdf at x=3, and multiply by 21. The observed and expected counts are:\n\nsum(((d$sample-d$expected)^2/d$expected)[1:4]) + (3-2.65)^2/2.65\n\n 0.62\n\n\nNext, we find the degrees of freedom, n - p -1, where n is the number of categories and p is the number of parameters estimated. We have 5 categories, and we estimated the mean of the Poisson distribution, so the degrees of freedom are 5 - 1 - 1, or 3. Therefore, we compare our test statistic 0.616 against the critical value of the chi-square distribution with 3 degrees of freedom. The 95th percentile for the chi- square distribution with 3 degrees of freedom is 7.8.\n\nqchisq(0.95,3)\n\n 7.8\n\n\nSome students have tried a Q-Q plot of the Poisson quantiles against the data quantiles. Because there are only 4 distinct values in the sample, the plot shows most of the dots on top of each other. Comparing empirical and theoretical frequencies to is much more informative for discrete distributions with very few values.\nWe can also compare the sample mean and sample variance of the observations, recalling that the mean and variance of the Poisson distribution are the same. The sample mean of the observations is 1.90 and the sample variance is 1.59. The standard deviation of the sample mean is approximately equal to the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size, or \\(\\sqrt{1.59/21} = 0.275\\). Therefore, the CI is\n\n1.90 + c(-1,1)*0.275*qt(0.975,20)\n\n 1.3 2.5\n\n\nThe observations seem consistent with the hypothesis that the mean and standard deviation are equal.\nYou did not need to do everything described in this solution. If you gave a thoughtful argument for whether the Poisson distribution was a good model, and if you used the data in a reasonable way to evaluate the fit of the distribution, you would receive credit for this problem.\n\nTo find the posterior distribution, we calculate the Poisson likelihood at each of the 20 lambda values, and multiply by the prior probability of 1/20. Then we divide each of these values by their sum. The formula is: \\[\np(\\lambda|X) = \\frac{f(X|\\lambda)g(\\lambda)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{20} f(X|\\lambda_i)g(\\lambda_i)}\n\\] We use the constant prior of \\(g(\\lambda) = 1/20\\) factors out of both the numerator and denominator, so it is unnecessary to include it. In fact, when the prior distribution is uniform, the posterior distribution is the same as the normalized likelihood.\n\nThe posterior pmf is shown in the plot below.\n\nlambda = seq(0,4,0.2)\nlikelihood=function(lambda) prod(dpois(cnt,lambda))\nl = sapply(lambda,likelihood)\nposterior = l/sum(l)\nbarplot(posterior,names.arg=lambda,xlab=\"lambda\",ylab=\"posterior probability\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nm = sum(posterior*lambda)\nprint(m)\n\n 2\n\nsqrt(sum(posterior*(lambda-m)^2))\n\n 0.3\n\n\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that a Poisson distribution provides a good model for counts of cars passing by this point on the roadway. The rate is approximately 2 cars per 15 seconds. There is uncertainty about this rate. There is a 95% chance the rate is less than or equal to 2.4, and there is about a 98% probability that the rate lies between 1.4 and 2.6 cars per second. If we gathered more data, we would gain more information about the rate, which would narrow the range of uncertainty.\n\n\n\nExercise 27.77 (Car Count Part 2) This problem continues analysis of the automobile traffic data. As before, assume that counts of cars per 15-second interval are independent and identically distributed Poisson random variables with unknown mean \\(\\Lambda\\).\n\nAssume that \\(\\Lambda\\), the rate parameter of the Poisson distribution for counts, has a continuous gamma prior distribution for \\(\\Lambda\\) with shape 1 and scale 10e6. (The gamma distribution with shape 1 tends to a uniform distribution as the scale tends to \\(\\infty\\), so this prior distribution is “almost” uniform.) Find the posterior distribution of \\(\\Lambda\\). State the distribution type and hyperparameters.\nFind the posterior mean and standard deviation of \\(\\Lambda\\). Compare your results to Part I. Discuss.\nFind a 95% symmetric tail area posterior credible interval for \\(\\Lambda\\). Find a 95% symmetric tail area posterior credible interval for \\(\\theta\\), the mean time between vehicle arrivals.\nFind the predictive distribution for the number of cars passing in the next minute. Name the family of distributions and the parameters of the predictive distribution. Find the mean and standard deviation of the predictive distribution. Find the probability that more than 10 cars will pass in the next minute. (Hint: one minute is four 15-second time intervals.)\n\nSolution:\n\nWe observed 40 cars passing in \\(n\\)=21 15-second intervals.\n\n\nsum(cnt)\n\n 40\n\n\nThe posterior distribution is a gamma distribution with shape 1 + 40 = 41\n\n1+sum(cnt)\n\n 41\n\n\nand scale\n\nn = length(cnt)\n1/(1e-6 + n)\n\n 0.048\n\n\nThe posterior distribution is \\[\n\\Lambda|X \\sim \\text{Gamma}(41,0.04761905)\n\\]\n\ncurve(dgamma(x,shape=41,scale=0.04761905),from=0,to=5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe posterior mean is 41/21=1.952, and the posterior standard deviation is \\(\\sqrt{41}/21 = 0.304\\).

The slight differences in the median and mode are clearly artifacts of discretization. The discretized analysis gives a good approximation to the continuous analysis.\n\nThe 95% symmetric tail area posterior credible interval for \\(\\Lambda\\) is\n\n\nqgamma(c(0.025,0.975),shape=41,scale=0.04761905)\n\n 1.4 2.6\n\n\nand for \\(\\Theta\\) is\n\n1/qgamma(c(0.975,0.025),shape=41,scale=0.04761905)\n\n 0.39 0.71\n\n\n\nThe Poisson / Gamma predictive distribution is a negative binomial distribution. For this problem, we predict the number of cars in the next four time periods (1 minute is four 15-second blocks). The predictive distribution is negative binomial with the parameters:\n\n\nsize a= 41\nprob p = 1/(1+4b) = 1/(1+4/21) = 0.84\n\nThe mean is \\(nab = 4\\cdot 41\\cdot 0.84 = 7.81\\) and standard deviation of the predictive distribution is \\[\n\\sqrt{na \\dfrac{1-p}{p^2}} = \\sqrt{4\\cdot 41 \\cdot \\dfrac{1-0.84}{0.84^2}} = 2.83\n\\] The probabilities, as computed by the R dnbinom function, are shown in the table. Results from the Poisson probability mass function with mean \\(4ab = 7.81\\) are shown for comparison.\n\nk = 0:20\np = dnbinom(k,size=41,prob=1/(1+4/21))\np = p/sum(p)\np = round(p,3)\np = c(p,1-sum(p))\npoisson = round(dpois(k,7.81),3)\npoisson = c(poisson,1-sum(poisson))\nd = cbind(k,p,poisson)\nprint(d)\n\n       k      p poisson\n [1,]  0  0.001   0.000\n [2,]  1  0.005   0.003\n [3,]  2  0.017   0.012\n [4,]  3  0.040   0.032\n [5,]  4  0.070   0.063\n [6,]  5  0.101   0.098\n [7,]  6  0.124   0.128\n [8,]  7  0.133   0.143\n [9,]  8  0.127   0.139\n[10,]  9  0.111   0.121\n[11,] 10  0.089   0.094\n[12,] 11  0.066   0.067\n[13,] 12  0.046   0.044\n[14,] 13  0.030   0.026\n[15,] 14  0.018   0.015\n[16,] 15  0.011   0.008\n[17,] 16  0.006   0.004\n[18,] 17  0.003   0.002\n[19,] 18  0.002   0.001\n[20,] 19  0.001   0.000\n[21,] 20  0.000   0.000\n[22,]  0 -0.001   0.000\n\nbarplot(t(d[,2:3]),beside=TRUE,names.arg=d[,1],xlab=\"k\",ylab=\"probability\")\nlegend(\"topright\",c(\"negative binomial\",\"poisson\"),fill=c(\"black\",\"white\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between the Bayesian predictive distribution and the Poisson distribution using a point estimate of the rate is even more pronounced if we predict for the next 21 time periods (5 1/4 minutes). This was not required, but is interesting to examine. Again, the distribution is negative binomial with: size \\(a = 41\\), and probability \\(p = 1/(1 + 21b) = 0.5\\)\n\nk = 0:65\np = dnbinom(k,size=41,prob=0.5)\np = p/sum(p)\np = c(p,1-sum(p))\npoisson = dpois(k,21*41/21)\npoisson = c(poisson,1-sum(poisson))\nd = cbind(k,p,poisson)\nbarplot(t(d[,2:3]),beside=TRUE,names.arg=d[,1],xlab=\"k\",ylab=\"probability\")\nlegend(\"topright\",c(\"negative binomial\",\"poisson\"),fill=c(\"black\",\"white\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo summarize, the predictive distribution is negative binomial with size \\(a = 41\\), and probability \\(p = 1/(1 + nb)\\) where \\(n\\) is the number of periods into the future we are predicting. The uncertainty in \\(\\Lambda\\) makes the predictive distribution more spread out than the Poisson distribution with the same mean. When n=1, the Poisson and negative binomial probabilities are very similar. The differences become more pronounced as we try to predict further into the future.\n\n\nExercise 27.78 (Lung disease) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common lung disease characterized by difficulty in breathing. A substantial proportion of COPD patients admitted to emergency medical facilities are released as outpatients. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study examined the incidence of relapse in COPD patients released as outpatients as a function of whether the patients received treatment with corticosteroids. A total of 147 patients were enrolled in the study and were randomly assigned to treatment or placebo group on discharge from an emergency facility. Seven patients were lost from the study prior to follow-up. For the remaining 140 patients, the table below summarizes the primary outcome of the study, relapse within 30 days of discharge.\n\n\n\n\nRelapse\nNo Relapse\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\n19\n51\n70\n\n\nPlacebo\n30\n40\n70\n\n\nTotal\n49\n91\n140\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) be the number of patients who relapse in the treatment and placebo groups, respectively. Assume \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) are independent Binomial(70,\\(\\theta_i\\) ) distributions, for \\(i=1,2\\). Assume \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) have independent Beta prior distributions with shape parameters 1/2 and 1/2 (this is the Jeffreys prior distribution). Find the joint posterior distribution for \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\). Name the distribution type and its hyperparameters.\nGenerate 5000 random pairs \\((\\theta_1, \\theta_2)\\), \\(k=1,\\ldots,5000\\) from the joint posterior distribution. Use this random sample to estimate the posterior probability that the rate of relapse is lower for treatment than for placebo. Discuss your results.\n\nSolution:\n\nThe prior distribution for each condition is \\(Beta(1/2,1/2)\\). Therefore, the posterior distributions for \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) are Beta distributions with parameters and quantiles as shown below.\n\n\n# Study results\nk.trt=19    # Number of relapses in treatment group\nn.trt=70    # Number of patients in treatment group\nk.ctl=30    # Number of relapses in control group\nn.ctl=70    # Number of patients in control group\n\n#Prior hyperparameters\nalpha.0 =0.5\nbeta.0=0.5\n\n# The joint posterior distribution is the product of two independent beta\n# distributions with posterior hyperparameters as shown below\nalpha.trt=alpha.0 + k.trt\nbeta.trt=beta.0 + n.trt-k.trt\nalpha.ctl=alpha.0 + k.ctl\nbeta.ctl=beta.0 + n.ctl-k.ctl\n\n# Posterior credible intervals\ntrt.intrv=qbeta(c(0.025,0.975),alpha.trt,beta.trt)\nctl.intrv=qbeta(c(0.025,0.975),alpha.ctl,beta.ctl)\n\nd = data.frame(treatment=c(alpha.trt,beta.trt,trt.intrv), control=c(alpha.ctl,beta.ctl,ctl.intrv), row.names=c(\"alpha\",\"beta\",\"2.5%\",\"97.5%\"))\nknitr::kable(t(d))\n\n\n\n\n\nalpha\nbeta\n2.5%\n97.5%\n\n\n\n\ntreatment\n20\n52\n0.18\n0.38\n\n\ncontrol\n30\n40\n0.32\n0.55\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to remember that the joint density or mass function is a function of all the random variables. Because \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) are independent and the \\(Y_i\\) are independent conditional on the \\(\\theta_i\\), the two posterior distributions are independent. We can see this by writing out the joint distribution of the parameters and observations: \\[\nBin(x_1|\\theta_1,70)Bin(x_2|\\theta_2,70)Be(\\theta_1|1,1)Be(\\theta_2|1,1) = {70 \\choose 19}\\theta_1^{19}(1-\\theta_1)^{51}{70 \\choose 30}\\theta_2^{30}(1-\\theta_2)^{40}\n\\] This is proportional to the product of two Beta density functions, the first with parameters (19.5,51.5), and the second with parameters (30.5,40.5).\nConditional on the observations, \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) are independent Beta random variables. The marginal distribution of \\(\\theta_1\\) is Beta(19.5, 51.5) and the marginal distribution of \\(\\theta_1\\) is Beta(30.5, 40.5).\nThe joint density function is the product of the individual density functions (remember that if \\(n\\) is an integer, \\(n! = \\Gamma(n+1))\\) and \\(B(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\Gamma(\\alpha)\\Gamma(\\beta)/\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta)\\) \\[\nBe(\\theta_1|20,52)Be(\\theta_2\\mid 31,41) = \\dfrac{\\Gamma(20+52)}{\\Gamma(20)\\Gamma(52)}\\theta_1^{19}(1-\\theta_1)^{51}\\dfrac{\\Gamma(31+41)}{\\Gamma(31)\\Gamma(41)}\\theta_2^{30}(1-\\theta_2)^{40}\n\\] A plot of the two posterior density functions is shown below. The 95% credible intervals are shown on the plot as vertical lines\n\ncurve(dbeta(x,19.5,51.5),0,0.6,ylab=\"Density\",lty=2,ylim=c(0,8))\ncurve(dbeta(x,30.5,40.5),0,0.6,add=TRUE)\nabline(v=trt.intrv,lty=2, lwd=0.5)\nabline(v=ctl.intrv,lty=2, lwd=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo visualize the joint density function of \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\), we can do a surface or contour plot (you were not required to do this). The joint density function is a function of two variables, \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\). To visualize the joint density function, we need either a surface plot or a contour plot (you were not required to do this). A surface plot is shown below.\n\ngs&lt;-200        # grid size\ntheta.t&lt;-seq(0.25,0.6,length=gs)   # treatment mean\ntheta.c&lt;-seq(0.1,0.45 ,length=gs)  # control mean\n\ndens&lt;-matrix(0,gs,gs)             # density function\nfor(i in 1:gs) {\n  dens[i,]=dbeta(theta.t[i],alpha.trt,beta.trt) * dbeta(theta.c,alpha.ctl,beta.ctl)\n}\n\n# Perspective plot\n\npersp(theta.t,theta.c,dens,theta=30,phi=5,xlab=\"Treatment Relapse Prob\",\n      ylab=\"Control Relapse Prob\",zlab=\"Probability Density\",\n      xlim=theta.t[c(1,gs)] ,ylim=theta.c[c(1,gs)],\n      main=\"3D Plot of Joint Density for Treatment and Control Relapse Probs\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe posterior mean relapse probability for the treatment group is 19.5/71x100% = 27.5%. A 95% symmetric tail area credible interval is [17.8%, 38.3%]. The posterior mean relapse probability for the control group is 30.5/71x100% = 43.0%. A 95% symmetric tail area credible interval is [31.7%, 54.5%].\nAbout 1/4 of the treatment patients relapsed, whereas almost half the control patients relapsed. Most of the posterior density function for the treatment group lies below most of the posterior density function for the control group, but the 95% credible intervals for the two parameters overlap somewhat (you were not required to compute credible intervals). While this analysis suggests that treatment lowers the relapse probability, it does not provide a statistical basis for concluding that it does.\n\nThe joint posterior distribution is Beta(19.5,51.5)Beta(30.5, 40.5). That is, \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) are independent Beta random variables with shape parameters as given in the table above. To sample from this joint distribution, we can draw 5000 random samples from each of these Beta distributions\n\n\nset.seed(92) # Kuzy\nnsample=5000\ncontr = rbeta(nsample,19.5,51.5)\ntreat = rbeta(nsample,30.5,40.5)\n\ndiff=treat-contr     # Estimate of difference in relapse probs\nefficacious = diff&gt;0  # If treat &gt; control\nprob.efficacious=sum(efficacious)/nsample\nsd.probefficacious = sd(efficacious)/sqrt(nsample)\n\n#Posterior quantiles, mean and standard deviation of the difference in \n#relapse rates between treatment and control\nquantile(diff,c(0.05,0.5,0.95))\n\n   5%   50%   95% \n0.021 0.156 0.287 \n\nmean(diff)\n\n 0.15\n\nsd(diff)\n\n 0.08\n\n#Density Function for Difference in Treatment and Control Relapse Probabilities\nplot(density(diff),main=\"Kernel Density Estimator\",xlab=\"Difference in Treatment and Control Probabilities\",ylab=\"Posterior Probability Density\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis above provides evidence that there is a lower relapse probability in the treatment than in the control group. We estimate a 97.2% probability that the treatment has a lower relapse probability. The mean of the posterior distribution of the difference in relapse probabilities is approximately 0.155, and an approximate 90% credible interval for the difference in relapse rates is [0.021, 0.287].\n\n\nExercise 27.79 (Normal-Normal) Concentrations of the pollutants aldrin and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in nanograms per liter were measured in ten surface water samples, ten mid-depth water samples, and ten bottom samples from the Wolf River in Tennessee. The samples were taken downstream from an abandoned dump site previously used by the pesticide industry. The full data set can be found at http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~lynn/iid/wolf.river.dat. For this problem, we consider only HCB measurements taken at the bottom and the surface. The question of interest is whether the distribution of HCB concentration depends on the depth at which the measurement was taken. The data for this problem are given below.\n\n\n\nSurface\nBottom\n\n\n\n\n3.74\n5.44\n\n\n4.61\n6.88\n\n\n4.00\n5.37\n\n\n4.67\n5.44\n\n\n4.87\n5.03\n\n\n5.12\n6.48\n\n\n4.52\n3.89\n\n\n5.29\n5.85\n\n\n5.74\n6.85\n\n\n5.48\n7.16\n\n\n\nAssume the observations are independent normal random variables with unknown depth-specific means \\(\\theta_s\\) and \\(\\theta_b\\) and precisions \\(\\rho_s  = 1/\\sigma^2_s\\) and \\(\\rho_b = 1/\\sigma_s^2\\). Assume independent improper reference priors for the surface and bottom parameters: \\[\ng(\\theta_s,\\theta_b ,\\rho_s,\\rho_b ) = g(\\theta_s,\\rho_s)g(\\theta_b ,\\rho_b) \\propto \\rho_s^{-1}\\rho_b^{-1}.\n\\]\n\nThis prior can be treated as the product of two normal-gamma priors with \\(\\mu_s = \\mu_b = 0\\), \\(\\sigma_s \\rightarrow 0\\) and \\(\\sigma_b \\rightarrow 0\\), \\(a_s = a_b = -1/2\\), and \\(b_s = b_b \\rightarrow 0\\).

Use your Monte Carlo samples to estimate 90% posterior credible intervals for all four parameters. Compare with the result of part a.\nUse your direct Monte Carlo sample to estimate the probability that the mean bottom concentration \\(\\theta_b\\) is higher than the mean surface concentration \\(\\theta_s\\) and to estimate the probability that the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) of the bottom concentrations is higher than the standard deviation \\(\\sigma_b\\) of the surface concentrations.\nComment on your analysis. What are your conclusions about the distributions of surface and bottom concentrations? Is the assumption of normality reasonable? Are the means different for surface and bottom?

Comment on your results.\nRepeat part e, but use a model in which the standard deviation is known and equal to the sample standard deviation, and the depth-specific means \\(\\theta_s\\) and \\(\\theta_b\\) have a uniform prior distribution. Compare the 95% credible intervals for the future sample means for the known and unknown standard deviation models. Discuss.\nAssume that experts have provided the following prior information based on previous studies.\n\n\nThe unknown means \\(\\theta_s\\) and \\(\\theta_b\\) are independent and normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\tau\\). The unknown precisions \\(\\rho_s\\) and \\(\\rho_b\\) are independent of \\(\\theta_s\\) and \\(\\theta_b\\) and have gamma distributions with shape \\(a\\) and scale \\(b\\).\nExperts specified a 95% prior credible interval of [3, 9] for \\(\\theta_s\\) and \\(\\theta_b\\). A good fit to this credible interval is obtained by setting the prior mean to \\(\\mu =6\\) and the prior standard deviation to \\(\\tau=1.5\\).\nA 95% prior credible interval of [0.75, 2.0] is given for the unknown standard deviations \\(\\Sigma_s\\) and \\(\\Sigma_b\\). This translates to a credible interval of [0.25, 1.8] for \\(\\rho_s = \\Sigma_s^{-1}\\) and \\(\\rho_b = \\Sigma_b^{-2}\\). A good fit to this credible interval is obtained by setting the prior shape to $a = 4.5. and the prior scale to \\(b\\) = 0.19. Find the following conditional distributions: \\(p(\\theta_s \\mid D,\\theta_b,\\rho_s,\\rho_b)\\), \\(p(\\theta_b \\mid D,\\theta_s,\\rho_s,\\rho_b)\\), \\(p(\\rho_s \\mid D,\\theta_s,\\theta_b,rho_b)\\), \\(p(\\rho_b \\mid D, \\theta_s,\\theta_b,\\rho_s)\\)\n\n\nUsing the distributions you found, draw 10,000 Gibbs samples of \\((\\theta_s,\\theta_b,\\rho_s,\\rho_b)\\).

Find the autocorrelation function of \\(\\theta_b-\\theta_s\\) and the effective sample size for your Monte Carlo sample for \\(\\theta_b-\\theta_s\\).\nComment on your results. Compare with parts a,b, and c.\n\nSolution:\n\nThe joint posterior distribution for the parameters \\((\\theta_s,\\theta_b,\\rho_s,\\rho_b)\\) is the product of an improper prior density for the surface parameters times an improper prior density for the bottom parameters. The joint posterior density is proportional to the joint prior density times the surface and bottom likelihood functions: \\[\ng(\\theta_s,\\theta_b ,\\rho_s,\\rho_b \\mid x_s,x_b) \\propto g(\\theta_s,\\rho_s)g(\\theta_b ,\\rho_b) g(x_s \\mid \\theta_s,\\rho_s)g(x_b \\mid \\theta_b,\\rho_b)\n\\]\n\nThe first two factors are proportional to the posterior density of the surface parameters; the second two factors are proportional to the posterior density of the bottom parameters. Therefore, the surface and bottom parameters are independent given the data with joint posterior density: \\[\ng(\\theta_s,\\theta_b ,\\rho_s,\\rho_b \\mid x_s,x_b) \\propto g(\\theta_s,\\rho_s \\mid x_s)g(\\theta_b ,\\rho_b \\mid x_b)\n\\] We will calculate the posterior distributions for the surface and bottom parameters in turn.\nThe prior density for the surface parameters is \\(g(\\theta_s,\\rho_s) \\propto \\rho_s^{-1}\\)\nThis is the limit of the density function for a normal-gamma conjugate prior distribution. We use the Normal-Normal-Gamma update rules.

There is also evidence that the surface concentrations may have less variation around the mean than the bottom observations, but because of the small sample size, more evidence is needed to make a definitive assessment of whether the standard deviations are different. The p-value is 0.93 for the surface observations and 0.53 for the bottom observations, which does not reject the hypothesis of normality.

Assume there are 20 possible tumor probabilities: \\(0.025, 0.075,\\ldots, 0.975\\). Assume that the tumor probability is uniformly distributed. Find the posterior distribution for the tumor probability given the data for this study.\nRepeat Part a for a second study in which 1 in 18 rats had a tumor.\nParts a and b assumed that each study had a different tumor probability, and that these tumor probabilities were uniformly distributed a priori. Now, assume the tumor probabilities are the same for the two studies, and that this probability has a uniform prior distribution. Find the posterior distribution for the common tumor probability given the combined results from the two studies.\nCompare the three distributions for Parts a, b, and c. Comment on your results.\n\nSolution:\nWe assume that tumors occur independently, with a probability of \\(\\Theta\\) of a tumor in each rat in the study. Our data \\(X\\) consist of observations on \\(N\\) rats, in which we record which rats have tumors. We can use either of two methods to represent the likelihood of what we have observed:\nMethod 1: We list, for each observation, whether or not the rat has a tumor. We multiply together the probability of getting the observation we obtained: \\(\\Theta\\) if the rat has a tumor, and 1-\\(\\Theta\\) if the rat does not have a tumor. If x out of n rats have tumors, the probability of observing this sequence of observations is \\(\\Theta^k(1-\\Theta)^{n-k}\\). Using Method 1, the posterior distribution for \\(\\Theta\\) is given by: \\[\ng (\\theta | x ) = \\dfrac{f ( x | \\theta ) g (\\theta )}{\\sum_{i=1}^{20} f ( x | \\theta_i ) g (\\theta_i )} = \\dfrac{\\theta^x (1 - \\theta )^{n- x}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{20} \\theta_i^x (1 - \\theta_i )^{n - x}}\n\\]\nMethod 2: We count how many of the rats have tumors. We remember from our previous statistics class that if the tumors occur independently with probability \\(\\Theta\\), the number of rats with tumors out of a total of \\(n\\) rats will have a Binomial distribution with parameters \\(n\\) and \\(\\Theta\\). The probability of getting \\(k\\) tumors is \\[\nC_n^k \\theta^k (1 - \\theta )^{n - k},\\quad k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n,\\quad \\mathrm{where}\\quad C_n^k = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\] Then, the posterior distribution for \\(\\Theta\\) is given by: \\[\ng (\\theta | x ) = \\dfrac{f ( x | \\theta ) g (\\theta )}{\\sum_{i=1}^{20} f ( x | \\theta_i ) g (\\theta_i )} = \\dfrac{C_n^k \\theta^x (1 - \\theta )^{n - x}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{20} C_n^k \\theta_i^x (1 - \\theta_i )^{n - x}}\n\\]\nIn Method 1, we are representing the likelihood of getting this exact sequence of observations. In Method 2, we are representing the likelihood of getting this number of tumors.\nIt is clear that the two methods give the same posterior distribution, because the constant \\(C_n^k\\) cancels out of the numerator and denominator of Bayes rule. That is, the number of tumors is a sufficient statistic for \\(\\Theta\\), and the order in which the tumors occur is irrelevant.\nPart a.

It is also useful to verify that we would get the same results in Part c if we used the posterior distribution from Part a as the prior distribution for Part c, and the likelihood from Part b as the likelihood for part c. That is, we would get the same result from a two-step process, in which we started with a uniform prior distribution, incorporated the results from the first study to obtain a posterior distribution, and then incorporated the results from the second study to get a new posterior distribution.\nPart d. We can compare the distributions more easily if we plot the prior distribution, the posterior distributions for the parameters of the two individual studies, and the combined posterior distribution together (see below). We see that the posterior distribution from the first study puts more probability on higher values of \\(\\Theta\\) than the posterior distribution for the second study. This is not surprising, because a higher proportion of rats in the first study had tumors. There is a great deal of overlap in the two distributions, which suggests that the two probabilities may be the same. Thus, it is reasonable to consider combining the two samples. If there had been very little overlap in the posterior distributions from Parts a and b, it would not have been reasonable to combine the studies. Later in the semester, we will look more carefully at the problem of when to combine probabilities and when to estimate them separately. When the studies are combined, the posterior distribution is narrower than the posterior distribution for either of the two individual studies, with less probability on very low and very high values of \\(\\Theta\\). Note that the combined distribution is consistent with both of the individual distributions, in the sense that it places high probability on values that also have high probability in the other two distributions. The combined distribution is more concentrated around values close to the combined sample proportion of about 1 in 10.\n\nallDist=rbind(prior,posta,postb,postc) \nbarplot(allDist,main=\"Prior and Posterior Distributions for TumorProbability\",xlab=\"Theta\",ylab=\"Probability\", col=c(\"mediumpurple\",\"lightblue\",\"pink\",\"lightgreen\"), border=c(\"darkviolet\",\"darkblue\", \"red\",\"darkgreen\"),names.arg=theta, legend=c(\"Prior\",\"Study 1\", \"Study 2\", \"Both Studies\"), beside=TRUE, ylim=c(0,0.4))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 27.87 Let \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) be independent and identically distributed as a \\(Exp(1)\\) distribution.

The density function of W is \\[\\begin{aligned}     f_W(W = w) &=& P(X+\\frac{1}{2}Y = w) \\\\     &=& \\int_0^w f_{X,\\frac{1}{2}Y}(x, w-x)dx  \\\\     &=& \\int_0^w f_X(x)f_{\\frac{1}{2}Y}(w-x)dx \\\\     &=& \\exp(-w)*\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-2w)\\right)\\end{aligned}\\]\n\\[\\begin{aligned}     E(W) &=& \\int w*f_W(w)dw \\\\     &=& \\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\int w*\\frac{1}{3}\\exp(-3w)dw\\right) \\\\     &=& \\frac{3}{2} = E(X) + \\frac{1}{2}E(Y)\\end{aligned}\\]\nBy induction, the density function for \\(W = X + \\frac{1}{2} Y + \\frac{1}{3} Z\\) should be \\(\\exp(-w)*\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-2w)\\right)*\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\exp(-3w)\\right)\\)\n\n\nExercise 27.88 (Poisson MLE vs Baye) You are developing tools for monitoring number of advertisemnt clicks on a website. You have observed the following data:\n\ny = c(4,1,3,4,3,2,7,3,4,6,5,5,3,2,4,5,4,7,5,2)\n\nwhich represents the number of clicks every minute over the last 10 minutes. You assume that the number of clicks per minute follows a Poisson distribution with parameter \\(\\lambda\\).\n\nPlot likelihood function for \\(\\lambda\\).\nEstimate \\(\\lambda\\) using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). MLE is the value of \\(\\lambda\\) that maximizes the likelihood function or log-likelihood function. Maximizing likelihood is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood function (log is a monotonically increasing function).\nUsing barplot, plot the predicted vs observed probabilities of for number of clicks from 1 to 7. Is the model a good fit?\nAssume that you know, that historically, the average number of clicks per minute is 4 and variance is also 4. Those numbers were valculated over a long period of time. You can use this information as a prior. Assume that the prior distribution is \\(Gamma(\\alpha,\\beta)\\). What would be appropriate values for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) that would represent this prior information?\nFind the posterior distribution for \\(\\lambda\\) and calculate the Bayesian estimate for \\(\\lambda\\) as the expectation over the posterior.\nAfter collecting data for a few days, you realized that about 20% of the observations are zero. How this information would change your prior distribution? This is an open-ended question.\n\nHint: For part c, you can use the following code to calculate the predicted probabilities for the number of clicks from 0 to 5.\n\ntb = table(y)\nobserved = tb/length(y)\npredicted = dpois(1:7,lambda_mle)\n\nSolution: a)\n\nlambda = seq(0, 10, 0.1)\nlikelihood = sapply(lambda, function(l) prod(dpois(y, l)))\nplot(lambda, likelihood, type = \"l\", xlab = expression(lambda), ylab = \"Likelihood\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlambda_mle = optim(par = 1, fn = function(l) -sum(dpois(y, l, log = TRUE)))$par\nlambda_mle\n\n 4\n\n\nAlternatively, the likelihood function is \\[\nL(\\lambda) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\lambda^{y_i}e^{-\\lambda}}{y_i!}\n\\] and the log-likelihood function is \\[\n\\log L(\\lambda) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i \\log(\\lambda) - n\\lambda\n\\] The MLE is the value of \\(\\lambda\\) that maximizes the log-likelihood function. We can find the MLE by taking the derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to \\(\\lambda\\) and setting it equal to zero. This gives \\[\n\\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\log L(\\lambda) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i - n = 0\n\\] Solving for \\(\\lambda\\) gives \\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i.\n\\] A simple average of the data gives the MLE for \\(\\lambda\\).\n\nmean(y)\n\n 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\npred = table(y)/length(y)\npoisson = dpois(1:7,lambda_mle)\nd = cbind(pred, poisson)\nbarplot(t(d),names.arg=1:7, xlab = \"Clicks\", ylab = \"Frequency\", beside = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know that \\(E(X) = \\alpha/\\beta = 4\\) and \\(Var(X) = \\alpha/\\beta^2 = 4\\). For example, \\(\\alpha = 4\\) and \\(\\beta = 1\\) would match the historical data.\n\n\n\nalpha = 4\nbeta = 1\nalphas = alpha + sum(y)\nbetas = beta + length(y)\nlambda_bayes = alphas/betas\nknitr::kable(data.frame(alpha = alphas, beta = betas, lambda_bayes = lambda_bayes))\n\n\n\n\nalpha\nbeta\nlambda_bayes\n\n\n\n\n83\n21\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use a mixture prior with one component concentrated around zero and another component concentrated around the mean that is calculated by removing zeroes from the data. The component weights are 0.2 and 0.8 respectively.\n\n\n\nExercise 27.89 (Exponential Distribution) Let \\(x_1, x_2,\\ldots, x_N\\) be an independent sample from the exponential distribution with density \\(p (x | \\lambda) = \\lambda\\exp (-\\lambda x)\\), \\(x \\ge 0\\), \\(\\lambda&gt; 0\\). Find the maximum likelihood estimate \\(\\lambda_{\\text{ML}}\\). Choose the conjugate prior distribution \\(p (\\lambda)\\), and find the posterior distribution \\(p (\\lambda | x_1,\\ldots, x_N)\\) and calculate the Bayesian estimate for \\(\\lambda\\) as the expectation over the posterior.\n\n\nExercise 27.90 (Bernoulli Baeys) We have \\(N\\) Bernoulli trials with success probability in each trial being equal to \\(q\\), we observed \\(k\\) successes. Find the conjugate distribution \\(p (q)\\). Find the posterior distribution \\(p (q | k, N)\\) and its expectation.\n\n\nExercise 27.91 (Exponential Family (Gamma)) Write density function of Gamma distribution in a standard exponential family form. Find \\(Ex\\) and \\(E\\log x\\) by differentiating the normalizing constant.\n\n\nExercise 27.92 (Exponential Family (Binomial)) Write density function of Binomial distribution in a standard exponential family form. Find \\(Ex\\) and \\(Var x\\) by differentiating the normalizing constant.\n\n\nExercise 27.93 (Normal) Let \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are independent \\(N(0,1)\\) random variables. Let \\[Y_1 = X_1^2 + X_2^2, \\quad Y_2 = \\frac{X_1}{\\sqrt{Y_1}}\\]\n\nFind joint distribution of \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\).\nAre \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) independent or not?\nCan you interpret the result geometrically?\n\nDensity of \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) is \\[f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\\]",

    "text": "27.5 AB Testing\n\nExercise 27.94 (A/B Testing) During a recent breakout of the flu, 850 out 6,224 people diagnosed with the virus presented severe symptoms. During the same flu season, a experimental anti-virus drug was being tested. The drug was given to 238 people with the flu and only 6 of them developed severe symptoms. Based on this information, can you conclude, for sure, that the drug is a success?\nSolution:\nNull hypothesis is \\(H_0: p_1 - p_2 = 0\\), \\(H_a: p_1 - p_2 \\neq 0\\). \\[\n\\hat{p}_1 = \\frac{850}{6224} = 0.136, \\quad \\hat{p}_2 = \\frac{6}{238} = 0.025, \\quad \\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2 = 0.136-0.025 = 0.111\n\\] The standard error is \\[\ns = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.136 \\times (1 - 0.136)}{6224} + \\frac{0.025 \\times ( 1- 0.025)}{238} }= 0.011\n\\] t-stat is \\[\nt = \\frac{\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2 - 0}{s} = \\frac{0.136 - 0.025}{0.011} = 10.09 &gt; 1.96\n\\]\nYes, given this information we can conclude that the drug is working.\nIf you do confidence interval, the \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval of \\(p_1 - p_2\\) is \\[\n[0.111 - 1.96 \\times 0.011, 0.111 + 1.96\\times 0.011] = [0.089, 0.133]\n\\] which doesn’t contain 0. We reject the null hypothesis.\n\n\nExercise 27.95 (Tesla Supplier) Tesla purchases Lithium as a raw material for their batteries from either of two suppliers and is concerned about the amounts of impurity the material contains. The percentage impurity levels in consignments of the Lithium follows closely a normal distribution with the means and standard deviations given in the table below. The company is particularly anxious that the impurity level not exceed \\(5\\)% and wants to purchase from the supplier who is ore likely to meet that specification.\n\n\n\n\nMean\nStandard Deviation\n\n\n\n\nSupplier A\n4.4\n0.4\n\n\nSupplier B\n4.2\n0.6\n\n\n\n\nWhich supplier should be chosen?\nWhat if Supplier B implements some quality control which has no effect on the standard deviation but raises their mean to \\(4.6\\)?\n\n\n\nExercise 27.96 (Red Sox) On September 24, 2003, Pete Thamel in the New York Times reported that the Boston Red Sox had been accused of cheating by another American League Team. The claim was that the Red Sox had a much better winning record at home games than at games played in other cities.\nThe following table provides the wins and losses for home and away games for the Red Sox in the 2003 season\n\n\n\n\nRecord\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam\nHome Wins\nHome Losses\nAway Wins\nAway Losses\n\n\nBoston Red Sox\n53\n28\n42\n39\n\n\n\nIs there any evidence that the proportion of Home wins is significantly different from home and away games?\nDiscuss any other issues that are relevant.\nHint: a 95% confidence interval for a difference in proportions \\(p_1 - p_2\\) is given by \\[\n( \\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2 ) \\pm 1.96\n\\sqrt{ \\frac{ \\hat{p}_1 ( 1 - \\hat{p}_1 ) }{ n_1 }  +\n\\frac{ \\hat{p}_2 ( 1 - \\hat{p}_2 ) }{ n_2 } }\n\\]\nSolution:\nThe home and away winning proportions are given by \\[\np_1 = \\frac{53}{81} = 0.654  \\; \\; \\text{ and} \\; \\;  \\text{ Var} = \\frac{ p_1 ( 1- p_1 ) }{ n_1 } = \\frac{53 \\times 28 }{81^3} = 0.0028\n\\] and \\[\np_2 = \\frac{42}{81} = 0.518 \\; \\; \\text{ and} \\; \\;  \\text{ Var} = \\frac{ p_2 ( 1- p_2 ) }{ n_2 } = \\frac{42 \\times 39}{81^3} = 0.0031\n\\] Can either do the problem as a confidence interval or a hypothesis test.\nFor the CI, we get \\[\n\\left (  \\frac{53}{81} - \\frac{42}{81} \\right ) \\pm 1.96 \\sqrt{  \\frac{53 \\times 28 }{81^3} + \\frac{42 \\times 39}{81^3} } = ( 0.286 , -0.014 )\n\\] As the confidence interval contains zero there is no significant difference at the \\(5\\)% level.\nFor the hypothesis test we have the null hypothesis that \\(H_0 : p_1 = p_2\\) versus \\(H_1 : p_1 \\neq p_2\\). Then the test statistic is approximately normally distributed (large \\(n = n_1 + n_2\\)) is and given by \\[Z = \\frac{ 0.654 - 0.518 }{\\sqrt{ 0.0059} } = 1.875\\] At the \\(5\\)% level the critical value is \\(1.96\\) and so there’s not statistical significance.\nThe major issue here is whether you should test whether the proportions from home and away are different. There might be a significant home team bias in general and we should test to see if the Red Sox advantage is significantly different from that. All things else equal this will reduce the significance of the Red Sox home advantage bias.\n\n\nExercise 27.97 (Myocardial Infarction) In a five year study of the effects of aspirin on Myocardial Infarction (MI), or heart attack, you have the following dataset on the reduction of the probability of getting MI from taking aspirin versus a Placebo, or control.\n\n\n\nTreatment\nwith MI\nwithout MI\n\n\n\n\nPlacebo\n198\n10845\n\n\nAspirin\n104\n10933\n\n\n\n\nFind a \\(95\\)% confidence interval for the difference in proportions \\(p_1-p_2\\).\nPerform a hypothesis test of the null \\(H_0 : p_1 = p_2\\) at a \\(1\\)% significance level.\n\nSolution:\nConverting to proportions:\n\n\n\nTreatment\nwith MI\nwithout MI\nn\n\n\n\n\nPlacebo\n0.01793\n0.98207\n11043\n\n\nAspirin\n0.00942\n0.99058\n11037\n\n\n\n\nThe CI for a difference in proportion is: \\[(\\hat{p}_1-\\hat{p}_2)\\pm z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}_1(1-\\hat{p}_1)}{n_1}+\\frac{\\hat{p}_2(1-\\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}\\] \\[=(0.01793-0.00942)\\pm 1.96\\sqrt{\\frac{0.01793(1-0.01793)}{11043}+\\frac{0.00942(1-0.00942)}{11037}}\\] \\[=0.00851\\pm 1.96\\sqrt{0.0000015945+0.0000008454}=0.00851\\pm 1.96\\sqrt{0.0000024399}\\] \\[=0.00851\\pm 1.96*0.00156205=0.00851\\pm 0.00306\\] Therefore, the CI for the difference in these proportions is: \\[(0.00545,0.01157)\\]\nAt the 1% level, we would have a implied CI for the difference in proportions of: \\[=0.00851\\pm 2.58*0.00156205=0.00851\\pm 0.00403\\] Therefore, the CI for the difference in these proportions is: \\[(0.00448,0.01254)\\] We can see that this CI does not contain 0, so therefore we can reject the null that \\(p_1=p_2\\) at the 1% significance level.\n\n\n\nExercise 27.98 (San Francisco Giants) In October 1992, the ownership of the San Francisco Giants considered a sale of the franchise that would have resulted in a move to Florida. A survey from the San Francisco Chronicle found that in a random sample of \\(625\\) people, 50.7% would be disappointed by the move. Find a 95% confidence interval of the population proportion\nSolution:\nThe 95% CI is found by \\[\n\\hat{p} \\pm z_{\\alpha /2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}=.507\\pm 1.96\\sqrt{\\frac{.507\\times .493}{625}}=.507\\pm 2\\times .020=\\left(.467,.547\\right)\n\\]\n\n\nExercise 27.99 (Pfizer) Pfizer introduced Viagra in early 1998 and during \\(1998\\) of the \\(6\\) million Viagra users \\(77\\) died from coronary problems such as heart attacks. Pfizer claimed that this rate is no more than that in the general population.\nYou find from a clinical study of \\(1,500,000\\) men who were not on Viagra that \\(11\\) of then died of coronary problems in the same length of time during the \\(77\\) Viagra users who dies in \\(1998\\).\nDo you agree with Pfizer’s claim that the proportion of Viagra users dying from coronary problems is no more than that of other comparable men?\nSolution:\nA 95% confidence interval for a difference in proportions \\(p_1 - p_2\\) is given by \\[( \\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2 ) \\pm 1.96\n\\sqrt{ \\frac{ \\hat{p}_1 ( 1 - \\hat{p}_1 ) }{ n_1 }  +\n\\frac{ \\hat{p}_2 ( 1 - \\hat{p}_2 ) }{ n_2 } }\\]\nCan do a confidence interval or a \\(Z\\)-score test.\nWith Viagra, \\(\\hat{p}_1 = 77/6000000 = 0.00001283\\) and without Viagra \\(\\hat{p}_2 = 11/1500000 = 0.00000733\\). Need to test whether these are equal.\nWith a \\(95\\)% confidence interval for \\(( p_1 - p_2 )\\), you get an interval \\(( 0.00000549 , 0.0000055 )\\) which doesn’t contain zero. Hence evidence that the proportion is higher.\nMeasured very accurately due to the large sample sizes.\nWith testing might use a one-sided test and an \\(\\alpha\\) of \\(0.01\\).\n\n\nExercise 27.100 (Voter: CI) Given a random sample of \\(1000\\) voters, \\(400\\) say they will vote for Donald Trump if the Republican nomination for the 2016 US Presidential Election. Given that he gets the nomination, a \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval for the true proportion of voters that will vote for him includes \\(45\\%\\).\nSolution:\nFalse, \\(\\hat p = \\frac{400}{1000} = 40\\%\\) and \\[\ns_{\\hat p} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat p(1-\\hat p)}{1000}} = 0.0072\n\\] The \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval is \\([0.4 \\pm] 0.0142\\). which does not include \\(45\\%\\).\n\n\nExercise 27.101 (Survey AB testing) In a pre-election survey of \\(435\\) voters, \\(10\\) indicated that they planned to vote for Ralph Nader. In a separate survey of \\(500\\) people, \\(250\\) said they planned to vote for George Bush.\n\nPerform a hypothesis test at the 5% level for the hypothesis that Nader will get 3% or less of the vote.\nFind a 95% confidence interval for the difference in the proportion of people that will vote for George Bush versus Ralph Nader.\n\nSolution:\n\n\\(H_{0}:p\\leq 0.03\\) \\(H_{1}:p&gt;0.03\\) \\(z=\\frac{\\hat{p}-p_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_{0}(1-p_{0})}{n}}}\\) where \\(\\hat{p}=\\frac{10}{435}=0.023\\) and \\(p_{0}=0.03\\). Hence, \\(z=\\frac{0.023-0.03}{\\sqrt{\\frac{0.03\\cdot 0.97}{435}}}=-0.86\\), \\(z_{\\alpha }=1.65\\) (one-sided test!) so we do not reject \\(H_{0}\\) as \\(z&lt;z_{\\alpha }\\).\nWe know that the confidence interval is given by \\((\\hat{p}_{1}-\\hat{p}_{2})\\pm 1.96\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}_{1}(1-\\hat{p}_{1})}{n_{1}}+\\frac{\\hat{p}_{2}(1-\\hat{p}_{2})}{n_{2}}}\\) and we have \\(\\hat{p}_{1}=\\frac{250}{500}=0.5\\) and \\(\\hat{p}_{2}=\\frac{10}{435}=0.023\\). Plugging everything into the formula we find: \\((0.5-0.023)\\pm 1.96\\sqrt{\\frac{0.5\\cdot 0.5}{500}+\\frac{0.023\\cdot 0.977}{435}}=[0.431,0.523]\\)\n\n\n\nExercise 27.102 (Significance Tests.) Some defendants in southern states have challenged verdicts made during the ’50s and ’60s, because of possible unfair jury selections. Juries are supposed to be selected at random from the population. In one specific case, only 12 jurors in an 80 person panel were African American. In the state in question, 50% of the population was African American. Could a jury with 12 African Americans out of 80 people be the result of pure chance?\nUsing \\(n = 80\\), \\(X = 12\\) find a 99% confidence interval for the proportion \\(p\\). Is that significantly different from \\(p = 0.5\\).\n\n\nExercise 27.103 A marketing firm is studying the effects of background music on people’s buying behavior. A random sample of \\(150\\) people had classical music playing while shopping and \\(200\\) had pop music playing. The group that listened to classical music spent on average $ \\(74\\) with a standard deviation of $ \\(18\\) while the pop music group spent $ \\(78.4\\) with a standard deviation of $ \\(12\\).\n\nTest whether there is any significant difference between the difference in purchasing habits. Describe clearly your null and alternative hypotheses and any test statistics that you use.\nIs there a difference between using a \\(5\\)% and \\(1\\)% significance level.\n\nSolution:\nWe are given the following: \\(\\bar{x}=74,s_{x}=18,n_{x}=150,\\bar{y}=78.4,s_{y}=12,n_{y}=200\\)\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nH_{0}:\\mu_{x}-\\mu_{y} & = & 0\\\\\nH_{1}:\\mu_{x}-\\mu_{y} & \\neq & 0\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn order to test for this hypothesis, we calculate the z-score and compare it with the z score at 5% and 1% confidence level.\\[z=\\frac{\\bar{x}-\\bar{y}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_{x}^{2}}{n_{x}}+\\frac{s_{y}^{2}}{n_{y}}}}=\\frac{74-78.4}{\\sqrt{\\frac{324}{150}+\\frac{144}{200}}}=-2.592\\]\nSince \\(z&gt;z_{0.025}\\), we can reject the null hypothesis at 95% confidence level and say that there exist significant differences between purchasing habits.\nFor \\(\\alpha=0.05\\), \\(z_{\\alpha/2}=1.96\\) and for \\(\\alpha=0.01\\), \\(z_{\\alpha/2}=2.575\\). Thus, the answer does not change when we move from 95% to 99% confidence level.\nAlternately, the above question can be solved by creating a confidence interval based on the differences. Again, we will reach the same conclusion.\n\n\nExercise 27.104 (Sensitivity and Specificity) The quality of Nvidia’s graphic chips have the probability that a randomly chosen chip being defective is only \\(0.1\\)%. You have invented a new technology for testing whether a given chip is defective or not. This test will always identify a defective chip as defective and only “falsely” identify a good chip as defective with probability \\(1\\)%\n\nWhat are the sensitivity and specificity of your testing device?\nGiven that the test identifies a defective chip, what’s the posterior probability that it is actually defective?\nWhat percentage of the chips will the new technology identify as being defective?\nShould you advise Nvidia to go ahead and implement your testing device? Explain.\n\nSolution:\nWe have the following probabilities (\\(D\\) represents “defective chip” and \\(T\\) represents “test result indicates defective chip”): \\[P(D)=0.001\\] \\[P(T|D)=1\\] \\[P(T|\\bar{D})=0.01\\]\n\nSensitivity: \\(P(T|D)=1\\) and Specificity: \\(P(\\bar{T}|\\bar{D})=1-P(T|\\bar{D})=1-0.01=0.99\\)\n\\[P(D|T)=\\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T)}=\\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T|D)P(D)+P(T|\\bar{D})P(\\bar{D})}\\] \\[=\\frac{(1)(0.001)}{(1)(0.001)+(0.01)(1-0.001)}=0.090992\\]\n\\[P(T) = P(T|D)P(D)+P(T|\\bar{D})P(\\bar{D})\\] \\[=(1)(0.001)+(0.01)(1-0.001)=0.01099\\]\nNo, only 9% of those chips indicated to be defective by the test will actually be defective.

Buffett claimed that a simple index fund would beat a portfolio strategy (fund-of-funds) picked by Protege over a ten year time frame. At Buffett’s shareholder meeting, he provided an update of the current state of the bet. The bundle of hedge funds picked by Protege had returned \\(21.9\\)% in the eight years through \\(2015\\) and the S&P500 index fund had soared \\(65.7\\)%.\n\n\n\n\nSP Index\nHedge Funds\n\n\n\n\n2008\n-37.0%\n-23.9%\n\n\n2009\n26.6%\n15.9%\n\n\n2010\n15.1%\n8.5%\n\n\n2011\n2.1%\n-1.9%\n\n\n2012\n16.0%\n6.5%\n\n\n2013\n32.3%\n11.8%\n\n\n2014\n13.6%\n5.6%\n\n\n2015\n1.4%\n1.7%\n\n\ncumulative\n65.7%\n21.9%\n\n\n\n\nUse a paired \\(t\\)-test to assess the statistical significance between the two return strategies\nHow likely is Buffett to win his bet in two years?\n\nSolution:\nTo conduct a paired t-test, we need define a new variable \\[\nD = SP.Index - Hedge.Funds.\n\\] Assume that \\(D_i \\overset{i.i.d.}{\\sim} N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). the null hypothesis we want to test is \\[\nH_0: \\mu=0\n\\] The mean and standard deviation of the difference \\(\\{D_i\\}_{i=1}^n\\) are \\[\n\\bar{D} = 0.0574,\\quad s_D = 0.0969\n\\]\n\nSP.Index = c(-37,26.6,15.1,2.1,16,32.3,13.6,1.4)\nHedge.Funds = c(-23.9,15.9,8.5,-1.9,6.5,11.8,5.6,1.7)\nSP.Index = SP.Index/100\nHedge.Funds = Hedge.Funds/100\nmean(SP.Index-Hedge.Funds)\n\n 0.057\n\nsd(SP.Index-Hedge.Funds)\n\n 0.097\n\n\nTherefore the t-statistic is \\[t=\\frac{\\bar{D}}{s_D\\sqrt{1/n}} = \\frac{0.0574}{0.0969\\times\\sqrt{1/8}}=1.6755.\\] Notice that the degree of freedom is \\(8 - 1 = 7\\). The corresponding p-value is \\[P(|t_7|&gt;1.6755) = 0.1378\\]\n\n2*pt(1.6755,df=7,lower.tail = FALSE) #0.1377437\n\n 0.14\n\n\nIn R, you can easily perform t-test using the following command, which gives the same test result as above.\n\nt.test(SP.Index,Hedge.Funds,paired = TRUE)\n\n\n    Paired t-test\n\ndata:  SP.Index and Hedge.Funds\nt = 2, df = 7, p-value = 0.1\nalternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.024  0.138\nsample estimates:\nmean difference \n          0.057 \n\n\nThe p-value is larger than 0.05. Thus we don’t reject the null hypothesis at 5% significance level. In other words, these two return strategies are not significantly different.\nFor the second question, the exact probability of Buffett winning his bet is calculated by \\[P\\left(\\frac{(1+S_9)(1+S_{10})(1+65.7\\%)}{(1+H_9)(1+H_{10})(1+21.9\\%)}&gt;1\\right)\\] where \\(S_9, S_{10}, H_9, H_{10}\\) are returns of two strategies in 9th and 10th year. To derive the distribution of the left hand side expression is difficult. Here we instead give a simulation solution, where the returns are assumed to be i.i.d. Normal variables.\n\nm1 = mean(SP.Index)\ns1 = sd(SP.Index)\nm2 = mean(Hedge.Funds)\ns2 = sd(Hedge.Funds)\nN = 1000 \ncum1 = NULL # cumulative return of SP.Index\ncum2 = NULL # cumulative return of Hedge.Funds\nset.seed(410)\nfor (i in 1:N)\n{ \n  # simulate returns in 2016 and 2017\n  return1 = c(0.657, rnorm(n=2, mean = m1, sd = s1)) \n  # compute the cumulative return\n  cum1 = c(cum1, cumprod(1+return1)) \n  \n  return2 = c(0.219, rnorm(n=2, mean = m2, sd = s2))\n  cum2 = c(cum2, cumprod(1+return2))\n}\n\n# compute the prob. of Buffett winning\nmean(cum1&gt;cum2) #0.9296667\n\n 0.93\n\n\nThe estimated probability is 92.97%, indicating that Buffett is very likely to win his bet. Since the paired t - test suggests no significant difference in average returns, you can also estimate the mean by pooling the data and redo the simulation, which gives a smaller estimate (89.27%).\n\n\nExercise 27.110 (Shaquille O’Neal) Shaquille O’Neal (nicknamed Shaq) is an ex-American Professional basketball player. He was notoriously bad at free throws (an uncontested shot given to a player when they are fouled). The following table compares the first three years of Shaq’s career to his last three years.\n\n\n\nGroup\nFree Throws Made\nFree Throws Attempted\n\n\n\n\nEarly Years\n1352\n2425\n\n\nLater Years\n1121\n2132\n\n\n\nDid Shaq get worse at free throws over his career?\nSolution:\n\\[\n\\hat{p}_1 = \\frac{1352}{2425} = 0.5575, \\quad \\hat{p}_2 = \\frac{1121}{2132} = 0.5258,\n\\quad se( \\hat{p_1} - \\hat{p_2} ) = \\sqrt{ \\frac{ \\hat{p}_1 (1- \\hat{p}_1) }{ n_1 }  + \\frac{ \\hat{p}_2 (1- \\hat{p}_2)   }{ n_2 } } = 0.0148\n\\] The \\(Z\\)-score is \\[\nZ = \\frac{ \\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2 }{ se( \\hat{p_1} - \\hat{p_2} ) } = 2.14 \\; .\n\\] The p-value of Z-test is \\[P(|N(0,1)|&gt;2.14) = 0.0324\\] Thus we conclude that Shaq got worse at free throws.\n\n\nExercise 27.111 (Furniture Website) Furniture.com wishes to estimate the average annual expenditure on furniture among its subscribers. A sample of 1000 subscribers is taken. The sample standard deviation is found to be $670 and the sample mean is $3790.\n\nGive a 90% confidence interval for the average expenditure.\nTest the hypothesis that the average expenditure is less than $2,500 at the 1% level.\n\n\n\nExercise 27.112 (Grocery AB Testting) A grocery delivery service is studying the impact of weather on customer ordering behavior. To do so, they identified households which made orders both in October and in February on the same day of the week and approximately the same time of day. They found 112 such matched orders. The mean purchase amount in October was $121.45, with a standard deviation of $32.78, while the mean purchase amount in February was $135.99 with a standard deviation of $24.81. The standard deviation of the difference between the two orders was $38.28. To quantify the evidence in the data regarding a difference in the average purchase amount between the two months, compute the \\(p\\)-value of the data.\n\n\nExercise 27.113 (SimCity AB Testing) SimCity 5 is one of Electronic Arts (EA’s) most popular video games. As EA prepared to release the new version, they released a promotional offer to drive more pre-orders. The offer was displayed on their webpage as a banner across the top of the pre-order page. They decided to test some other options to see what design or layout would drive more revenue.\nThe control removed the promotional offer from the page altogether. The test led to some very surprising results. With a sample size of \\(1000\\) visitors, of the \\(500\\) which got the promotional offer they found \\(143\\) people wanted to purchase the games and of the half that got the control they found that \\(199\\) wanted to buy the new version of SimCity.\nTest at the \\(1\\)% level whether EA should provide a promotional offer or not.\nSolution:\nTo see whether the promotion program works, we need to find out whether the proportion of people who want to buy the game is larger. Denote \\(p_1\\) is the proportion from the experimental group with promotion and \\(p_2\\) from the control group without promotion. Therefore, the null hypothesis we are testing is \\[H_0: p_1 &gt; p_2\\]\nIn the sample, we observe \\[n_1 = n_2 = 500\\] \\[\\hat{p_1} = 199/500 \\mbox{ and } \\hat{p_2} = 143/500\\]\nTo perform the two-sample t-test, we need to calculate the pooled sample standard deviation first. \\[\\bar{p} = \\hat{p_1}*\\frac{n_1}{n_1+n_2} + \\hat{p_2}*\\frac{n_2}{n_1+n_2} = 171/500\\] \\[\\bar{\\sigma} = \\sqrt{\\bar{p}*(1-\\bar{p})*(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2})} = 0.03\\]\nThen, \\[\\mbox{t-stat} = \\frac{\\hat{p_1} - \\hat{p_2}}{\\bar{\\sigma}} = 3.73 &gt; \\mbox{qnorm(0.995)} = 2.58\\]\nNow we can conclude that the promotional program works statistically at the 1% level.\n\n\nExercise 27.114 (True/False)  \n\nAt the Apple conference it was claimed that “\\(97\\)% of people love the iWatch”. From a market survey, you found empirically that \\(1175\\) out of a sample of \\(1400\\) people love the new iWatch. Statistically speaking,you can reject Apple’s claim at the \\(1\\)% significance level.

The last episode of Breaking Bad had a rating of \\(4.7\\) with a standard deviation of \\(0.5\\). The\\(p-value\\) for testing whether Breaking Bad’s rating is statistical different from the average is a lot less than \\(1\\)%.\nA chip manufacturer needs to add the right amount of chemicals to make the chips resistant to heat. On average the population of chips needs to be able to withstand heat of 300 degrees. Suppose you have a random sample of \\(30\\) chips with a mean of \\(305\\) and a standard deviation of\\(8\\). Then you can reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\mu= 300\\) versus\\(H_a: \\mu&gt; 300\\) at the \\(5\\)% level.\nZagats rates restaurants on food quality. In a random sample of \\(100\\)restaurants you observe a mean of \\(20\\) with a standard deviation of\\(2.5\\). Your favorite restaurant has a score of \\(25\\). This is statistically different from the population mean at the \\(5\\)% level.\nThe \\(t\\)-score is used to test whether a null hypothesis can be rejected.\nAn oil company introduces a new fuel that they claim has on average no more than \\(100\\) milligrams of toxic matter per liter. They take a sample of \\(100\\) liters and find that \\(\\bar{X} = 105\\) with a given\\(\\sigma_X = 20\\). Then there is evidence at the \\(5\\)% level that their claim is wrong.\nA wine producer claims that the proportion of customers who cannot distinguish his product from grape juice is at most 5%. For a sample of\\(100\\) people he finds that \\(10\\) fail the taste test. He should reject his null hypothesis \\(H_{0}:p=0.05\\) at the \\(5\\)% level.\nAs the \\(t\\)-ratio increases the \\(p\\)-value of a hypothesis test decreases.\n\nSolution:\n\nTrue. \\[\\hat{p} = \\frac{1175}{1400} = 83.9\\%\\]\\[\\hat{\\sigma} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{1400}} = 0.98\\%\\] For\\(H_0: p = 97\\%\\),\\[t-stat = \\frac{\\hat{p} - 97\\%}{0.98\\%} = -13.37 &lt; -2.58 = qnorm(0.005)\\]Yes, we can reject the null hypothesis at 1% significance level.\nTrue. The t-statistic is\\(T = (\\hat{p}-0.5)/\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p} \\times (1-\\hat{p})}{n}} = -9.13 &lt;\\)where \\(qnorm(0.025) = -1.96\\)\nFalse. The formula for a T-ratio is \\[\\begin{aligned}T = \\frac{\\bar{x}_1-\\bar{x}_2 - (\\mu_1 -\\mu_2)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_{x_1}^2}{n_1}+\\frac{s_{x_2}^2}{n_2}}}\\end{aligned}\\] However, since we do not know \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) we cannot get the T-ratio and thus p-value.\nTrue. Since the sample size is \\(n\\ge30\\) the t test is effectively the same as the z test. Therefore, we find the following z value:\\[z=\\frac{\\bar{x}-\\mu}{s/\\sqrt{n}}=\\frac{305-300}{8/\\sqrt{30}}=3.4233\\]Here we use a one-sided test: \\[z_\\alpha=1.65\\] Since \\(z&gt;z_\\alpha\\), we can reject \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_a\\) at the 5% level\nTrue. We can calculate the t statistic as \\((25-20)/(2.5/10)&gt;1.96\\). Hence we reject the null.\nTrue. The \\(t\\) score can be used to test whether a null hypothesis can be rejected or not. Alternately, a z score can be used\nTrue. This is a one-side test \\(H_0 : \\mu_x \\leq 100\\) versus\\(H_1 : \\mu_X &gt; 100\\). The \\(Z\\)-score is\\(Z = \\frac{105 -100}{ 20 / \\sqrt{100} } = 2.5\\). The critical value for a 1-sided test at the \\(5\\)% level is \\(1.64\\).

In a survey of \\(500\\) children who live in families where someone smokes, it was found that \\(10\\) children were in poor health. A \\(95\\)% confidence interval for the probability of a child living in a smoking family being in poor health is then \\(2\\)% to \\(4\\)%.\nYou are finding a confidence interval for a population mean. Holding everything else constant, an interval based on an unknown standard deviation will be wider than one based on a known standard deviation no matter what the sample size is.\nThere is a \\(95\\)% probability that a normal random variable lies between \\(\\mu \\pm \\sigma\\).\nA recent CNN poll found that \\(49\\)% of \\(10000\\) voters said they would vote for Obama versus Romney if that was the election in November 2012.

In other words, we are comparing between \\(z\\) distribution and \\(t\\) distribution\nFalse. There is a 95% probability that it lies between \\(\\mu\\pm1.96\\sigma\\)\nFalse. The confidence interval for the proportion is given by: \\[\\hat{p}\\pm1.96\\sqrt{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})/n}\\] This gives: \\[0.49\\pm1.96\\sqrt{(0.49)(0.51)/10000}=0.49\\pm0.009798\\]\nFalse. \\(CI=36.8\\pm1.96\\frac{4.5}{\\sqrt{30}}=(35.19,38.41)\\)\nFalse. The 95% CI is approximately equal to \\[.72 \\pm  1.96 \\sqrt{ \\frac{ \\hat{p} (1- \\hat{p})}{n} } = 0.72 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.045=(.63,.81)\\]\nFalse.

The p-value is the probability of the observing something more extreme than the observed sample assuming the null hypothesis is true\n\n\n\nExercise 27.116 (True/False: Sampling Distribution)  \n\nThe Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of a sample mean is approximately Normal.\nThe Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) is Normally distributed for large samples.\nThe Central Limit Theorem guarantees that the distribution of \\(\\bar{X}\\) is constant.\nThe sample mean, \\(\\bar{x}\\), approximates the population mean for large random samples.\nThe trimmed mean of a dataset is more sensitive to outliers than the mean.\nThe sample mean of a dataset must be larger than its standard deviation\nSelection bias is not a problem when you are estimating a population mean.\nThe kurtosis of a distribution is not sensitive to outliers.\n\nSolution:\n\nTrue. The standard deviation of the sample mean is \\(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\). The CLT has (approximately) \\(\\bar{X} \\sim N(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n})\\), where \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) are the population true value\nTrue. If \\(X_i\\) is a random sample (or \\(iid\\)) with mean \\(\\mu\\), then \\(\\sqrt{n}\\big(\\bar{X} - \\mu \\big) \\longrightarrow^d N(0,\\sigma^2)\\)\nFalse. For some set of independent random variables, the mean of a sufficiently large number of them (each with finite mean and variance) will have a distribution with variance depending on the number of samples.\nTrue. The CLT states that the \\(\\bar{X} \\sim N \\left ( \\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} \\right )\\), or the best guess for the population mean is \\(\\bar{x}\\)\nFalse. The trimmed mean is the average of the observations deleting the outer 5% in the tails. Hence, it is less sensitive to outliers than the sample .\nFalse. Many datasets have a negative mean and the standard deviation must be positive.\nFalse. When sampling to estimate a population mean, you need to be certain to select a random sample, or selection bias may affect your results.\nFalse. Kurtosis depends on each observation in the distribution and is extremely sensitive to the outliers",

    "text": "27.7 Added After Course Started\n\nExercise 27.119 (Emily, Car, Stock Market, Sweepstakes, Vacation and Bayes.)  \n\nEmily is taking Bayesian Analysis course. She believes she will get an A with probability 0.6, a B with probability 0.3, and a C or less with probability 0.1. At the end of semester she will get a car as a present form her (very) rich uncle depending on her class performance. For getting an A in the course Emily will get a car with probability 0.8, for B with probability 0.5, and for anything less than B, she will get a car with probability of 0.2. These are the probabilities if the market is bullish. If the market is bearish, the uncle is less likely to make expensive presents, and the above probabilities are 0.5, 0.3, and 0.1, respectively. The probabilities of bullish and bearish market are equal, 0.5 each. If Emily gets a car, she would travel to Redington Shores with probability 0.7, or stay on campus with probability 0.3. If she does not get a car, these two probabilities are 0.2 and 0.8, respectively. Independently, Emily may be a lucky winner of a sweepstake lottery for a free air ticket and vacation in hotel Sol at Redington Shores. The chance to win the sweepstake is 0.001, but if Emily wins, she will go to vacation with probability of 0.99, irrespective of what happened with the car.\nAfter the semester was over you learned that Emily is at Redington Shores.\n\nWhat is the probability that she got a car?\nWhat is the probability that she won the sweepstakes?\nWhat is the probability that she got a B in the course?\nWhat is the probability that the market was bearish?\n\nHint: You can solve this problem by any of the 3 ways: (ii) direct simulation using R, or Python, and (ii) exact calculation.

Assume the number of visitors arriving at the site at a given time of day is modeled as a Poisson random variable with a rate of \\(\\lambda\\) visitors per minute. Based on prior experience with similar web sites, the following estimates are given:\n\nThere is a 90% probability that the rate is greater than 5 visitors per minute.\nThe rate is equally likely to be greater than or less than 14 visitors per minute.\nThere is a 90% probability that the rate is less than 27 visitors per minute.\n\nFind a Gamma prior distribution for the arrival rate that fits these judgments as well as possible. Comment on your results.\nHint: there is no “right” answer to this problem. You can use trial and error to find a distribution that fits as well as possible. You can also use an optimization method such as Excel Solver to minimize a measure of how far apart the given quantiles are from the ones in the target distribution.\nSolution:\nWe can try different values to see whether we can get a result that is close to the given quantiles. Given, there are only 2 parameters, I simply did a grid-search. I generated a grid of 200x200 points and calculated the quantiles for each point. Then I found the point that was closest to the given quantiles. I used sum of absolute value differences to measure the distance between the given and calculated quantiles. You can use squared differences instead.\n\ng = expand.grid(seq(from=0.5,to=7,length=200),seq(from=0.5,to=10,length=200))\nqf = function(th) {\n  qgamma(c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9), shape=th[1], scale=th[2])\n}\nr = apply(g,1,qf)\ntarget = c(5,14,27)\nind = which.min((colSums(abs(r-target))))\nprint(g[ind,])\n\n      Var1 Var2\n20272  2.8  5.3\n\nd = data.frame(quantile = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9), expert = target, calculated = qf(as.numeric(g[ind,])))\nknitr::kable(d)\n\n\n\n\nquantile\nexpert\ncalculated\n\n\n\n\n0.1\n5\n5.3\n\n\n0.5\n14\n13.3\n\n\n0.9\n27\n27.0\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice instead of looping through the grid, I used expand.grid combined with apply to calculate the quantiles for each point. This is a more efficient way to do the same thing.\n\n\nExercise 27.121 (Normal-Likelihod) We observe samples of normal random variable \\(Y_i\\mid \\mu,\\sigma \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\) with known \\(\\sigma\\), specify and plot likelihood for \\(\\mu\\)\n\ny = (-4.3,0.7,-19.4), \\(\\sigma=10\\)\ny = (-12,12,-4.5,0.6), \\(\\sigma=6\\)\ny = (-4.3,0.7,-19.4), \\(\\sigma=2\\)\ny = (12.4,12.1), \\(\\sigma=5\\)\n\nHint: Remember that the nornal likelihood is the product of the normal density function evaluated at each observation \\[\nL(\\mu|y,\\sigma) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}e^{-(y_i-\\mu)^2/2\\sigma^2} = \\dfrac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma^2)^{n/2}}e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\mu)^2/2\\sigma^2}\n\\] The expression under the exponenta can be simplified to \\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\mu)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\mu^2 - 2\\mu y_i + y_i^2) = n\\mu^2 - 2\\mu\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i + \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2 = n\\mu^2 - 2\\mu n\\bar{y} + \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2 = n(\\mu^2 - 2\\mu\\bar{y} + \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2)      \n\\] Now \\[\n\\mu^2 - 2\\mu\\bar{y} + \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2 = \\mu^2 - 2\\mu\\bar{y} + \\bar y^2 - \\bar y^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2 (\\mu - \\bar{y})^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\bar{y})^2\n\\] The last summad does not depend on \\(\\mu\\) and can be ignored. Thus, the likelihood is proportional to \\[\ne^{\\dfrac{-(\\mu - \\bar{y})^2}{2\\sigma^2/n}}\n\\]\nSolution: Let’s implement the likelihood function. We will use two different functions to calculate the likelihood. The first function uses the \\(\\bar y\\) as summary statistic and evaluates normal density function to calculate the likelihood for the mean of the data. The second function uses the product of the normal density function to calculate the likelihood for the mean of the data. We will compare the results of the two functions to see if they are consistent.\n\nlhood1 = function(y, mu, sigma) {\n   dnorm(mean(y), mu, sigma/sqrt(length(y))) \n}\nlhood2 = function(y, mu, sigma) {\n   prod(dnorm(y, mu, sigma))\n}\nmu = seq(-15,15,0.1)\na1 = lhood1(c(-4.3,0.7,-19.4),mu,10)\na2 = sapply(mu,lhood2,y=c(-4.3,0.7,-19.4),sigma=10)\n(a1/a2)[1:5]\n\n 3253 3253 3253 3253 3253\n\nplot(mu,a1)\nlines(mu,3253.175*a2,col=\"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that two approaches to calculating the likelihood agree (up to a constant).\n\nplot(mu,a1,type=\"l\",xlab=\"mu\",ylab=\"likelihood\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(mu,lhood1(c (-12,12,-4.5,0.6),mu,6),type=\"l\",xlab=\"mu\",ylab=\"likelihood\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(mu,lhood1(c(-4.3,0.7,-19.4),mu,2),type=\"l\",xlab=\"mu\",ylab=\"likelihood\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(mu,lhood1(c(12.4,12.1),mu,5),type=\"l\",xlab=\"mu\",ylab=\"likelihood\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 27.122 (Normal-Normal for Lock5Data) Lock5Data package (Lock et al. 2016), includes results for a cross-sectional study of hippocampal volumes among 75 subjects (Singh et al. 2014): 25 collegiate football players with a history of concussions (FBConcuss), 25 collegiate football players that do not have a history of concussions (FBNoConcuss), and 25 control subjects. For our analysis, we’ll focus on the subjects with a history of concussions:\n\nlibrary(Lock5Data)\ndata(FootballBrain)\nd = FootballBrain[FootballBrain$Group==\"FBConcuss\",]\nplot(density(d$Hipp,bw=300))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssume that the hippocampal volumes of the subjects with a history of concussions are independent normal random variables with unknown mean \\(\\mu\\) and known standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\).

Now, based on memories of my experience as an assistant in a gentlemen’s outfitters in my university vacations, I would suggest a prior \\[\n\\mu \\sim N(38, 9).\n\\] Of course, it is open to question whether these men form a random sample from the whole population, but unless I am given information to the contrary I would stick to the prior I have just quoted, except that I might be inclined to increase the variance. My data shows that the mean turned out to be 39.8 with a standard deviation of 2.0 for the sample of 10 000.\n\nCalculate the posterior mean for the chest measurements of men in this population\nCalculate the predictive distribution for the next observation \\(x_{n+1}\\)\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\nmu0 = 38\nsigma0 = 9\nyhat = 39.8\nsigma = 2\nn = 10000\nk = n*sigma0^2 + sigma^2\nmus = sigma^2/k*mu0 + n*sigma0^2/k*yhat\nsigmas2 = sigma^2*sigma0^2/k\nprint(mus)\n\n 40\n\nprint(sigmas2)\n\n 4e-04\n\n\nNote that the posterior mean is equal to \\(\\bar y = 39.8\\) equal to the sample mean and variance is \\(0.0004\\) which is equal to 4/10000, the sample variance. Thus, our posterior is standardized likelihood \\[\nN(\\bar y, \\sigma^2/n)\n\\] Naturally, the closeness of the posterior to the standardized likelihood results from the large sample size, and whatever my prior had been—unless it were very extreme—I would have obtained very much the same result.\nMore formally, the posterior will be close to the standardized likelihood if the ratio of posterior and prior variances \\(\\sigma_*^2/\\sigma_0^2\\) is small or in other words when \\(\\sigma_0^2\\) is large compared to \\(\\sigma^2/n\\).\n\nThe predictive distribution for the next observation \\(x_{n+1}\\) can be derived by writing \\[\nx_{n+1}  = (x_{n+1} - \\mu) + \\mu\n\\] Now \\(x_{n+1}-\\mu \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\) and \\(\\mu \\sim N(\\mu^*,\\sigma^{*2})\\). Thus, the predictive distribution is \\[\nx_{n+1} \\sim N(\\mu^*,\\sigma^{*2} + \\sigma^2)\n\\]\n\n\nmu = mus\nsigma = sqrt(sigmas2 + sigma^2)\nprint(mu)\n\n 40\n\nprint(sigma)\n\n 2\n\n\n\n\nExercise 27.124 (Normal-Normal Hypothesis Test) Assume Normal-Normal model with known variance, \\(X\\mid \\theta \\sim  N(\\theta,\\sigma^2)\\), \\(\\theta \\sim  N(\\mu ,\\tau^2)\\), and \\(\\theta\\mid X \\sim  N(\\mu^*,\\rho^2)\\).

PROBLEMS
Section A: Energy Transfer (Ecosystems)
1. If the primary producers in an ecosystem store 25,000 kcal of energy, how much energy is available to the secondary consumers?
2. A food chain consists of grass, grasshoppers, mice, and owls. If the owls (quaternary consumers) have 15 kcal of energy available to them, how much energy did the grass (primary producers) initially capture?
3. In a marine food web, phytoplankton are the primary producers. Zooplankton eat phytoplankton, small fish eat zooplankton, and seals eat small fish. If a seal requires 2,000 kcal of energy per day, what is the minimum amount of energy the phytoplankton must provide to support one seal for a day?
4. An ecosystem has the following energy distribution: Producers (500,000 J), Primary Consumers (50,000 J), Secondary Consumers (5,000 J), and Tertiary Consumers (500 J). What is the overall energy transfer efficiency from the primary consumers to the tertiary consumers?
5. If 10% of energy is transferred between trophic levels, what percentage of the energy from the producers is available to the tertiary consumers?
6. A forest fire burns a large area, reducing the producer biomass by 80%. If the producers initially contained 1,000,000 kcal of energy, how much energy is now available to the primary consumers?
7. A pyramid of numbers for a grassland ecosystem has 1,500,000 individual grass plants, 200,000 insects, 900 birds, and 1 hawk. Assuming the energy transfer is proportional to the number of individuals, what is the approximate energy transfer efficiency between the insects and the birds?
8. In a given ecosystem, the net primary productivity is 12,000 kcal/m²/year. The energy available to secondary consumers is 120 kcal/m²/year. What is the combined efficiency of energy transfer from producers to primary consumers and from primary consumers to secondary consumers?
9. A primary consumer eats a plant containing 500 J of energy. 200 J are lost as waste, and 150 J are used for cellular respiration. How much energy is available to be passed on to a secondary consumer?
10. If an ecosystem supports 5 tertiary consumers, and each requires 1,000 kcal of energy, assuming a 10% transfer rule, what is the minimum number of primary consumers if each primary consumer provides 50 kcal of energy to the next level?

SOLUTIONS
Section A: Energy Transfer (Ecosystems)
1. Solution: Primary consumers get 10% of 25,000 kcal = 2,500 kcal. Secondary consumers get 10% of that. 2,500×0.10=250 kcal.
   * Answer: 250 kcal
2. Solution: Work backwards from the owls. Mice (tertiary): 15÷0.10=150 kcal. Grasshoppers (secondary): 150÷0.10=1,500 kcal. Grass (primary): 1,500÷0.10=15,000 kcal.
   * Answer: 15,000 kcal
3. Solution: Work backwards from the seal (tertiary consumer). Small fish (secondary): 2,000÷0.1=20,000 kcal. Zooplankton (primary): 20,000÷0.1=200,000 kcal. Phytoplankton (producers): 200,000÷0.1=2,000,000 kcal.
   * Answer: 2,000,000 kcal
4. Solution: The energy at the primary consumer level is 50,000 J. The energy at the tertiary consumer level is 500 J. The efficiency is (500J/50,000J)×100%=(1/100)×100%=1%.
   * Answer: 1%
5. Solution: Primary gets 10%. Secondary gets 10% of 10% (0.1×0.1=0.01 or 1%). Tertiary gets 10% of 1% (0.1×0.01=0.001 or 0.1%).
   * Answer: 0.1%
6. Solution: If 80% of the producer biomass is destroyed, 20% remains. 1,000,000×0.20=200,000 kcal. Primary consumers receive 10% of this remaining energy. 200,000×0.10=20,000 kcal.
   * Answer: 20,000 kcal
7. Solution: Efficiency = (Energy of birds / Energy of insects) × 100. (900/200,000)×100=(9/2000)×100=900/2000=0.45%.
   * Answer: 0.45%
8. Solution: The total energy transfer from producers to secondary consumers is from 12,000 to 120. The overall efficiency is (120/12,000)×100%=(1/100)×100%=1%.
   * Answer: 1%
9. Solution: Energy assimilated is Total - Waste = 500−200=300 J. Energy for growth (biomass) is Assimilated - Respiration = 300−150=150 J.
   * Answer: 150 J
10. Solution: Total energy for tertiary consumers: 5×1,000=5,000 kcal. Energy needed from secondary consumers: 5,000÷0.1=50,000 kcal. Energy needed from primary consumers: 50,000÷0.1=500,000 kcal. Number of primary consumers: 500,000÷50=10,000.
   * Answer: 10,000 primary consumers

Section B: Mass vs. Weight
11. Solution: Mass is an intrinsic property of an object and does not change with location.
   * Answer: 60 kg
12. Solution: First, find her mass: Mass=Weight/gEarth​=880N/10m/s2=88kg. Her weight on Mars: Weight=Mass×gMars​=88kg×3.7m/s2≈325.6N.
   * Answer: 325.6 N
13. Solution: Weight=mass×g=15kg×9.8m/s2=147N.
   * Answer: 147 N
14. Solution: Mass=Weight/g=300N/5m/s2=60kg.
   * Answer: 60 kg
15. Solution: Find the object's mass: Mass=120N/10m/s2=12kg. Then find gravity on Planet X: gX​=WeightX​/Mass=40N/12kg=10/3m/s2≈3.33m/s2.
   * Answer: 3.33 m/s²
16. Solution: Find the mass of Object B: MassB​=180N/10m/s2=18kg. Object A's mass is 20 kg.
   * Answer: Object A has a greater mass.
17. Solution: Weight=500kg×8.87m/s2=4435N.
   * Answer: 4435 N
18. Solution: Calculate the gravitational acceleration: g=Weight/Mass=49N/5kg=9.8m/s2. This is the gravitational acceleration on Earth.
   * Answer: Earth
19. Solution: Weight=Mass×gorbit​=250kg×8.7m/s2=2175N.
   * Answer: 2175 N
20. Solution: Since both have a mass of 1 kg, they have the same mass. Weight depends on mass and gravity. Since the gravitational pull of the Moon will be the same for both, their weights will be identical.
   * Answer: They have the same weight.

Section C: Clock Problems
21. Solution: At 3:30, the minute hand is at the 6 (180° from the 12). The hour hand is halfway between the 3 and 4. The position of the hour hand is 3×30°+0.5×30°=90°+15°=105°. The difference is 180°−105°=75°.
   * Answer: 75°
22. Solution: At 4 o'clock, the hands are 20 minute-spaces apart. To be opposite, they must be 30 minute-spaces apart. The minute hand must gain 50 minute-spaces on the hour hand. Time = 50×(12/11)=600/11≈54.54 minutes.
   * Answer: Approximately 4:54 and 33 seconds.
23. Solution: From noon, 5 hours and 10 minutes have passed. Total hours = 5+10/60=5+1/6=31/6 hours. The hour hand moves at 30° per hour. Total movement = (31/6)×30°=31×5°=155°.
   * Answer: 155°
24. Solution: The hands are at a right angle twice every hour, but at 3 and 9 o'clock, the positions overlap. This results in 22 right angles in a 12-hour period.
   * Answer: 22 times
25. Solution: For every 60 minutes of actual time, the clock shows 55 minutes. When the clock shows 4 PM, it has passed 4 hours or 240 minutes. Ratio: (Actual Time / Clock Time) = 60/55 = 12/11. Actual minutes passed = 240×(12/11)=2880/11≈261.8 minutes. This is 4 hours and 21.8 minutes.
   * Answer: Approximately 4:22 PM
26. Solution: At 7:20, the minute hand is at the 4 (120°). The hour hand is past the 7. Hour hand position = 7×30°+20×0.5°=210°+10°=220°. The difference is 220°−120°=100°.
   * Answer: 100°
27. Solution: At 8 o'clock, the hands are 40 minute-spaces apart. The minute hand must gain 40 spaces. Time = 40×(12/11)=480/11≈43.63 minutes.
   * Answer: Approximately 8:43 and 38 seconds.
28. Solution: From 8 AM Monday to 8 PM Tuesday is 36 hours. The clock gains 10 min in 24 hrs, so it gains (10/24)×36=15 minutes. The clock will show 8:15 PM.
   * Answer: 8:15 PM
29. Solution: In a correct clock, the hands overtake every 60×(12/11)≈65.45 minutes. This clock is faster. Time gained in 65 min = 65.45−65=0.45 min. Total minutes in a day = 24×60=1440. Total gain = (0.45/65)×1440≈9.97 minutes.
   * Answer: The clock gains approximately 10 minutes per day.
30. Solution: At 10:10, the minute hand is at the 2 (60°). Hour hand position = 10×30°+10×0.5°=300°+5°=305°. Angle = 305°−60°=245°. The smaller angle is 360°−245°=115°. The reflex angle is the larger one.
   * Answer: 245°

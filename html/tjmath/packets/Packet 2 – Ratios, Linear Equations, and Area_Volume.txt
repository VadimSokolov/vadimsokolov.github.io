Section C: Area, Volume, and Geometry
21. A triangle has sides 13 cm, 14 cm, and 15 cm. Use Heron's formula to find the area.
Solution:
* Step 1: Find the semi-perimeter (s).
   * s = (a + b + c) / 2
   * s = (13 + 14 + 15) / 2 = 42 / 2 = 21 cm
* Step 2: Use Heron's formula.
   * Area = √[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)]
   * Area = √[21(21-13)(21-14)(21-15)]
   * Area = √[21 * 8 * 7 * 6]
   * Area = √7056
   * Area = 84 cm²
22. A circular garden has an area of 154 m². Find the radius. (Use π ≈ 3.14)
Solution:
* Formula: Area = π * r²
* 154 = 3.14 * r²
* r² = 154 / 3.14
* r² ≈ 49.04
* r = √49.04
* r ≈ 7 m
23. A rectangular box has a surface area of 94 cm² and dimensions 3 cm × 2 cm × h. What is h?
Solution:
* Formula: SA = 2(lw + lh + wh)
* 94 = 2((32) + (3h) + (2*h))
* 94 = 2(6 + 5h)
* 47 = 6 + 5h
* 41 = 5h
* h = 8.2 cm
24. A cube has a surface area of 150 cm². What is its edge length?
Solution:
* Formula: SA = 6a²
* 150 = 6a²
* a² = 150 / 6
* a² = 25
* a = √25
* a = 5 cm
25. A cylinder has a volume of 314 cm³ and height 5 cm. Find its radius. (Use π ≈ 3.14)
Solution:
* Formula: V = π * r² * h
* 314 = 3.14 * r² * 5
* 314 = 15.7 * r²
* r² = 314 / 15.7
* r² = 20
* r = √20
* r ≈ 4.47 cm
26. A cone has a height of 12 cm and a volume of 376.8 cm³. What is the radius? (Use π ≈ 3.14)
Solution:
* Formula: V = (1/3) * π * r² * h
* 376.8 = (1/3) * 3.14 * r² * 12
* 376.8 = 3.14 * r² * 4
* 376.8 = 12.56 * r²
* r² = 376.8 / 12.56
* r² = 30
* r = √30
* r ≈ 5.48 cm
27. A circular track has a diameter of 70 m. A runner completes 4 full laps. How far did they run?
Solution:
* Step 1: Find the circumference (distance of one lap).
   * C = π * d
   * C = 3.14 * 70 = 219.8 m
* Step 2: Calculate the total distance for 4 laps.
   * Total Distance = 219.8 * 4
   * Total Distance = 879.2 m
28. A triangle has sides 9 cm, 40 cm, and 41 cm. Prove it's a right triangle and find the area.
Solution:
* Step 1: Prove it's a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²).
   * 9² + 40² = 41²
   * 81 + 1600 = 1681
   * 1681 = 1681
   * Since the equation is true, it is a right triangle.
* Step 2: Find the area.
   * The two shorter sides (9 cm and 40 cm) are the base and height.
   * Area = (1/2) * base * height
   * Area = (1/2) * 9 * 40
   * Area = 180 cm²
29. A square and a circle have the same perimeter. The square has a side length of 8 cm. What is the area of the circle? (Use π ≈ 3.14)
Solution:
* Step 1: Find the perimeter of the square.
   * Perimeter = 4 * side = 4 * 8 = 32 cm
* Step 2: The circle's circumference is also 32 cm. Find its radius.
   * C = 2 * π * r
   * 32 = 2 * 3.14 * r
   * 32 = 6.28 * r
   * r = 32 / 6.28 ≈ 5.096 cm
* Step 3: Find the area of the circle.
   * Area = π * r²
   * Area = 3.14 * (5.096)²
   * Area = 3.14 * 25.97
   * Area ≈ 81.54 cm²
30. A trapezoid has bases of 10 cm and 20 cm and a height of 6 cm. A triangle has the same area. What is the height of that triangle if its base is 15 cm?
Solution:
* Step 1: Find the area of the trapezoid.
   * Area = (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height
   * Area = (1/2) * (10 + 20) * 6
   * Area = (1/2) * 30 * 6 = 90 cm²
* Step 2: The triangle's area is also 90 cm². Find its height.
   * Area = (1/2) * base * height
   * 90 = (1/2) * 15 * h
   * 90 = 7.5 * h
   * h = 90 / 7.5
   * h = 12 cm

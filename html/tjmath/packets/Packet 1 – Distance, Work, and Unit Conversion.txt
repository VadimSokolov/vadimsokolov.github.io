SOLUTIONS


Section A: Distance = Rate × Time
1. A car travels at a constant speed of 60 mph. How far does it travel in 3.5 hours?
Solution:
* Formula: Distance = Speed × Time
* Plug in: Distance = 60 miles/hour × 3.5 hours = 210 miles
* Answer: 210 miles
2. A jogger runs 8 miles in 1.25 hours. What is their average speed in mph?
Solution:
* Formula: Speed = Distance ÷ Time
* Speed = 8 miles ÷ 1.25 hours = 6.4 miles/hour
* Answer: 6.4 mph
3. A cyclist rides at 15 mph. How long will it take to travel 18 miles?
Solution:
* Formula: Time = Distance ÷ Speed
* Time = 18 miles ÷ 15 miles/hour = 1.2 hours
* 0.2 hours = 0.2 × 60 minutes = 12 minutes
* Answer: 1 hour 12 minutes
4. A train travels 120 miles in 2 hours and 15 minutes. What is the average speed?
Solution:
* Convert 15 minutes to hours: 15 ÷ 60 = 0.25 hours → Total time = 2.25 hours
* Speed = 120 miles ÷ 2.25 hours = 53.33 miles/hour
* Answer: 53.33 mph
5. Train A leaves City X traveling east at 40 mph. Train B leaves City Y, 300 miles away, traveling west at 60 mph. When do they meet?
Solution:
* Let time = t hours. Train A goes 40t miles. Train B goes 60t miles.
* Total distance = 300 miles → 40t + 60t = 300 → 100t = 300 → t = 3 hours
* Answer: 3 hours
6. A boat travels downstream at 12 mph and upstream at 8 mph. If the river is 40 miles long, how long does a round trip take?
Solution:
* Time downstream = 40 ÷ 12 = 3.33 hours
* Time upstream = 40 ÷ 8 = 5 hours
* Total time = 3.33 + 5 = 8.33 hours
* Answer: 8.33 hours
7. A car drives half of a 200-mile trip at 50 mph and the other half at 70 mph. What is the average speed?
Solution:
* First half: 100 ÷ 50 = 2 hours
* Second half: 100 ÷ 70 ≈ 1.43 hours
* Total time = 2 + 1.43 = 3.43 hours
* Total distance = 200 miles → Avg speed = 200 ÷ 3.43 ≈ 58.3 mph
* Answer: 58.3 mph
8. Two runners start 10 miles apart and run toward each other. One runs at 6 mph and the other at 4 mph. When do they meet?
Solution:
* Combined speed = 6 + 4 = 10 mph
* Time = 10 ÷ 10 = 1 hour
* Answer: 1 hour
9. A hiker walks uphill at 3 mph and downhill at 5 mph. The round trip is 4 hours. How long is the trail one way?
Solution:
* Let distance = d miles
* Time up = d ÷ 3, time down = d ÷ 5
* Total time = d/3 + d/5 = 4
* Find LCD: (5d + 3d)/15 = 4 → 8d = 60 → d = 7.5 miles
* Answer: 7.5 miles
10. A plane travels 400 miles with a 30 mph tailwind, returns against 30 mph headwind. Airspeed = 150 mph. Total time?
Solution:
* With wind: 150 + 30 = 180 → Time = 400 ÷ 180 ≈ 2.22 hours
* Against wind: 150 - 30 = 120 → Time = 400 ÷ 120 ≈ 3.33 hours
* Total = 2.22 + 3.33 = 5.55 hours
* Answer: 5.55 hours
11. Helicopter has 6600 lbs of fuel, burns 1200 lbs/hour, must hover for 0.25 hours and reserve 1 hour. How far can it go and return at 150 mph?
Solution:
* Fuel for hover = 0.25 × 1200 = 300 lbs, reserve = 1200 lbs
* Usable fuel: 6600 - 300 - 1200 = 5100 lbs
* Time = 5100 ÷ 1200 = 4.25 hours → 2.125 hours each way
* Distance = 2.125 × 150 = 318.75 miles round trip
* Answer: 318.75 miles
12. Dog runs 3 miles north, 4 miles east, returns directly. Speed = 6 mph. Total time?
Solution:
* Return leg = √(3² + 4²) = √25 = 5 miles
* Total = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 miles → Time = 12 ÷ 6 = 2 hours
* Answer: 2 hours

Section B: Work and Rate Problems
13. A machine completes a job in 5 hours. What fraction per hour?
Solution:
* It takes 5 hours to do 1 job, so in 1 hour, it finishes 1/5 of the job.
* Think of it like slicing the job into 5 equal parts.
* Answer: 1/5 of the job per hour
14. Two machines: one finishes in 4 hours, the other in 6. How long working together?
Solution:
* Machine A rate = 1/4 job per hour
* Machine B rate = 1/6 job per hour
* Together: 1/4 + 1/6 = (3 + 2)/12 = 5/12 job per hour
* Time = 1 ÷ (5/12) = 12/5 = 2.4 hours = 2 hrs 24 min
* Answer: 2.4 hours
15. Faucets: 1 fills in 3 hrs, other in 4 hrs. Second one turns off after 1 hour. How long total?
Solution:
* Faucet A rate = 1/3, Faucet B = 1/4
* Combined for 1 hour = 1/3 + 1/4 = 7/12
* Remaining = 1 - 7/12 = 5/12
* A finishes rest: Time = (5/12) ÷ (1/3) = (5/12) × (3/1) = 15/12 = 1.25 hrs
* Total = 1 + 1.25 = 2.25 hours
16. A = 12 hrs, B = 8 hrs. They work together for 3 hrs, then A finishes alone. Solution:
* A’s rate = 1/12, B’s = 1/8 → Together = 5/24
* 3 hours × 5/24 = 15/24 = 5/8 job done
* Left = 3/8 → A finishes: (3/8) ÷ (1/12) = 3/8 × 12 = 4.5 hrs
* Total = 3 + 4.5 = 7.5 hours
17. 4 robots clean 12 rooms in 6 hrs. How long for 6 robots to clean 18 rooms? Solution:
* Work rate = 12 ÷ 6 = 2 rooms/hour (all 4 robots)
* 1 robot = 0.5 rooms/hr → 6 robots = 3 rooms/hr
* 18 ÷ 3 = 6 hours
18. Printer prints 6 pages per minute. Time for 450 pages?
Solution:
* 450 ÷ 6 = 75 minutes
19. Alice mows in 45 min, Bob in 60. Together?
Solution:
* A = 1/45, B = 1/60 → Together: (4 + 3)/180 = 7/180
* Time = 1 ÷ (7/180) = 180/7 ≈ 25.7 minutes
20. 3 pumps empty pool in 2 hrs. 2 pumps working alone? Solution:
* 3 pumps = 1/2 job/hr → 1 pump = 1/6 → 2 pumps = 1/3 job/hr
* Time = 1 ÷ (1/3) = 3 hours
21. 20 pages/hr × 120 pages = 6 hrs. Add 30 min breaks.
Solution:
* Total time = 6 hrs + 0.5 hrs = 6.5 hours
22. Jack paints 2/3 wall in 1.5 hrs. Full wall? Solution:
* 1.5 ÷ (2/3) = 1.5 × 3/2 = 4.5/2 = 2.25 hours

Section C: Unit Conversions & Applied Problems
23. Convert 3.5 hours to minutes and seconds.
Solution:
* 1 hour = 60 minutes → 3.5 hours = 3 hours and 0.5 × 60 = 30 minutes → 210 minutes
* 1 minute = 60 seconds → 210 minutes = 210 × 60 = 12,600 seconds
* Answer: 210 minutes and 12,600 seconds
24. A recipe calls for 2 liters of water. How many milliliters is this?
Solution:
* 1 liter = 1000 milliliters
* 2 liters = 2 × 1000 = 2000 milliliters
25. A car travels at 100 kilometers per hour. What is this speed in miles per hour? (1 mi = 1.61 km)
Solution:
* 1 km = 1 ÷ 1.61 ≈ 0.6211 miles
* 100 km = 100 × 0.6211 ≈ 62.1 mph
26. A plane consumes 1000 lbs of fuel per hour. How many pounds does it burn in 2 hours and 45 minutes?
Solution:
* 45 minutes = 0.75 hours → Total time = 2.75 hours
* Fuel = 1000 × 2.75 = 2750 lbs
27. Convert 5 gallons per minute to liters per second. (1 gal = 3.785 L)
Solution:
* 5 gal/min = 5 × 3.785 = 18.925 L/min
* 1 minute = 60 seconds → 18.925 ÷ 60 ≈ 0.315 L/sec
28. A circular pool with diameter 10 ft and depth 3 ft is filled at 1.5 cubic ft/min. How long to fill it?
Solution:
* Radius = 10 ÷ 2 = 5 ft
* Volume = π × r² × h = 3.14 × 5² × 3 = 3.14 × 25 × 3 = 235.5 ft³
* Fill rate = 1.5 ft³/min → Time = 235.5 ÷ 1.5 = 157 minutes
29. Convert 4000 mg to grams and kilograms.
Solution:
* 1000 mg = 1 g → 4000 mg = 4000 ÷ 1000 = 4 grams
* 1000 g = 1 kg → 4 ÷ 1000 = 0.004 kg
30. A truck moves at 60 mph for 2 hours, then 40 mph for 3 hours. What's the total distance and average speed?
Solution:
* First segment: 60 × 2 = 120 miles
* Second segment: 40 × 3 = 120 miles
* Total distance = 120 + 120 = 240 miles
* Total time = 2 + 3 = 5 hours
* Average speed = 240 ÷ 5 = 48 mph

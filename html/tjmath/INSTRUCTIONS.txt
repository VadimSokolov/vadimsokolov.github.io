TJ MATH QUIZ - HOW TO RUN
=========================

The quiz app needs to be run through a web server (not by opening the HTML file directly).
This is due to browser security restrictions when loading JSON files.

EASIEST METHOD (Mac):
---------------------
Double-click the "START_QUIZ.command" file
Your browser will automatically open to http://localhost:8000

ALTERNATIVE METHODS:
-------------------

Method 1: Python (Mac/Linux/Windows)
  1. Open Terminal
  2. cd /Users/vsokolov/www/html/tjmath
  3. python3 -m http.server 8000
  4. Open browser to: http://localhost:8000

Method 2: Node.js
  1. npm install -g http-server
  2. cd /Users/vsokolov/www/html/tjmath
  3. http-server
  4. Open browser to the URL shown

Method 3: PHP
  1. cd /Users/vsokolov/www/html/tjmath
  2. php -S localhost:8000
  3. Open browser to: http://localhost:8000

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
- If port 8000 is busy, use a different port (e.g., 8001, 8080, 3000)
- Make sure both index.html and bank.json are in the same directory
- Don't use "open index.html" - it won't work due to CORS restrictions

STOPPING THE SERVER:
-------------------
Press Ctrl+C in the terminal window

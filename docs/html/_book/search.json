    "text": "Preface\nWelcome to the fascinating world of Bayesian learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning! This book is your guide to understanding these powerful tools and their applications in various fields. This book is a culmination of our experiences teaching these exciting fields to two distinct audiences: business school students at the University of Chicago and engineers at George Mason University.\nThis unique blend of perspectives allows us to present these complex concepts in a way that is accessible to data scientists, business professionals and technical experts. Whether you’re a manager seeking to leverage AI in your organization or an engineer building the next generation of intelligent systems, this book has something for you.\nTechniques discussed in this book emerged as a transformative force in modern society, and its impact on automation is undeniable. From self-driving cars to virtual assistants, these technologies are already a part of our daily lives. In the coming years, they will become even more ubiquitous, impacting every industry and aspect of our lives. Understanding these technologies is essential for anyone who wants to stay ahead of the curve.\nThrough its ability to learn, adapt, and make decisions, AI is accelerating the pace of automation across various industries and sectors. This impact is multifaceted, encompassing both positive and negative aspects that warrant careful consideration. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and trends, providing valuable insights for informed decision-making. This leads to better resource allocation, optimized processes, and improved outcomes across various domains. Chatbots and virtual assistants powered by AI can handle customer inquiries and provide support 24/7, offering a personalized and efficient experience. It even works on Jewish holidays! This improves customer satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately benefiting businesses.\nAs a result, AI enables the creation of entirely new business models and industries that were previously not possible. This disrupts traditional markets and creates opportunities for innovation and growth. AI is driving significant progress in fields like self-driving cars, personalized medicine, and space exploration. This has the potential to revolutionize these industries and improve lives in numerous ways.\nThe term AI has morphed over time. It was first coined in 1956 by John McCarthy, who defined it as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.” Since then, the field has evolved significantly, and the definition of AI has changed accordingly. Today, AI is a broad field that encompasses various subfields, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. These subfields are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same thing. Machine learning is a subfield of AI that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn complex patterns and relationships in data. Natural language processing is a subfield of AI that focuses on algorithms that can understand and generate human language.\nSince 1956, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone significant transformations traditional AI was mostly focused on rule-based systems and boolean logic programming, with limited learning capabilities. It lead to them being brittle in changing environments. On the other hand, emerging AI is focused on modeling uncertainties, pattern matching, and deep learning. All of those are data-driven approaches. These approaches are more adaptable and can handle complex and unstructured data. They are also more data-dependent and lack interpretability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOld AI\n\n\n\nIf rain outside, then take umbrella\nThis rule cannot be learned from data. It does not allow inference. Cannot say anything about rain outside if I see an umbrella.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew AI\n\n\n\nProbability of taking umbrella, given there is rain\nConditional probability rule can be learned from data. Allows for inference. We can calculate the probability of rain outside if we see an umbrella.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis book is based on the lecture notes from our courses, which have been refined and expanded over years of teaching. We have incorporated valuable feedback from students, both at the University of Chicago and George Mason University, to create a comprehensive and engaging learning experience. This book is organized into three parts:\n\nPart 1: Bayesian Learning: This part covers the basics of probability and Bayesian inference.\nPart 2: Artificial Intelligence: This part explores the core concepts of AI such and mostly focuses on pattern matching techniques such as decision trees and generalized linear models.\nPart 3: Deep Learning: This part delves into the world of deep learning, focusing on the architecture and training of deep neural networks. It covers convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and generative adversarial networks.\n\nThis work is inspired by the contributions of many great thinkers in the field of AI and machine learning. We acknowledge the foundational work of pioneers such as: Shannon (Reinforcement Learning), von Neumann (Theory of Choice), Bellman (Optimality and Learning).\nThe evolution of AI can be summarised in three stages:\n\nSearch. Started with one question and webpages ranked by relevance. Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed PageRank algorithm that uses power iterations to rank webpages by relevance. The statistical tools such as Kendall’s tau and Spearman’s rank correlation were used to measure the similarity between the ranking and the actual relevance.\nSuggestions. The first popular suggestion algorithm was developed by Netflix. It used collaborative filtering to recommend movies to users based on their viewing history and the viewing history of other users. The idea was to minimize the burden on the user to search for movies to watch.\nSummaries. Current AI systems like ChatGPT and Perplexity have revolutionized how we interact with information by excelling at summarization and generalization. These large language models can take vast amounts of complex information and distill it into clear, coherent summaries that capture the essential points while maintaining accuracy. They can generalize across different domains, connecting concepts from various fields and providing insights that might not be immediately obvious. For example, ChatGPT can summarize lengthy research papers into key findings, while Perplexity can synthesize information from multiple sources to provide comprehensive answers to complex questions. This ability to summarize and generalize represents a significant leap forward from simple search and recommendation systems, as these AI agents can now act as intelligent intermediaries that understand context, identify patterns, and present information in ways that are most useful to users.\n\nFirst it was one question and one answer, next it was suggestions. You do not know what to search for, collaborative filtering, recommender systems, and search engines. Now, it is summarise, you are the manager of AI agents agents interpret your request, formulate a plan and necessary questions, and then execute the plan. This is the future of AI, where agents can work together to solve complex problems and provide valuable insights.\nBayesian learning is a powerful statistical framework based on the work of Thomas Bayes. It provides a probabilistic approach to reasoning and learning, allowing us to update our beliefs about the world as we gather new data. This makes it a natural fit for artificial intelligence, where we often need to deal with uncertainty and incomplete information. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a vast field that seeks to create intelligent agents capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks can include perception, reasoning, learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and language processing. AI has made significant progress in recent years, driven by advances in computing power, data availability, and algorithms. Deep learning is a subfield of AI that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data. These networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain and have the ability to learn complex patterns and relationships in data. Deep learning has achieved remarkable results in various tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and machine translation.\nThe world of business and engineering are increasingly intertwined, as AI becomes an essential tool in both domains. This book bridges the gap between these disciplines by demonstrating how Bayesian learning, AI, and deep learning can be applied to address real-world challenges in:\n\nBusiness: Market analysis, customer segmentation, risk management, and strategic decision-making.\nEngineering: Robotics, image recognition, natural language processing, and data-driven automation.\n\nKey Features of This Book:\n\nAccessible explanations: We break down complex concepts into manageable chunks, using real-world examples and analogies to illustrate key principles.\nCase studies: We showcase practical applications of Bayesian learning, AI, and deep learning across diverse industries.\nHands-on exercises: We provide practical exercises and code examples to help you apply the concepts covered in the book to your own projects.\n\nJoining the AI Revolution:\nThe field of AI is rapidly evolving, and this book equips you with the knowledge and skills necessary to stay ahead of the curve. Whether you’re looking to enhance your business acumen or advance your engineering career, understanding the power of Bayesian learning, AI, and deep learning is crucial.\nWe invite you to join us on this exciting journey and discover the transformative potential of these powerful tools!",

    "text": "Generative AI\n“If you tell me precisely what it is a machine cannot do, then I can always make a machine which will do just that. John von Neumann, 1956”\nWhen you open an Amazon page there are many personal suggestions of goods to purchase. By analyzing previous product pages visited and purchases made by you and other people who have bought similar products Amazon uses AI and machine learning to predict what would of interest to you next time you shop.\nWhen you apply for a loan online, you typically get an immediate answer after filling an application. The information you provide, combined with your credit history pulled from a credit history bureau is used by a predictive model which can tell with high level of confidence whether you are to default on the loan or not.\nYou might ask, what is common among one of the most successful Internet retail company, finance industry and a phenomenal baseball team? All of these decisions use AI and methods of predictive analytics to improve the operations. They used historical observations combined with rigorous statistical analysis and efficient computer algorithms to predict future outcomes and change the decisions. The ability to collect and analyze complex data sets has been a prerogative of a small number of people for many year. It vital to have experience in data engineering, statistics, machine learning and probability. A data scientists has all of those skills. Current tools developed by industry and academic institutions makes data science profession accessible to a wider audience without requiring a training in a specific technical filed.\nOver the past decade, there has been an explosion of work, mostly applied, on deep learning. Applications of deep learning are everywhere. The main reason for this is that large Internet companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix increasingly displace traditional statistical and machine learning methods with deep learning techniques. Though, such companies are at the frontier of applying deep learning, virtually any industry can be impacted by applying deep learning (DL).\nData Science is a relatively new field that refers to sets of mathematical and statistical models, algorithms, and software that allow extracting patterns from data sets. The algorithms are the adoptions of applied mathematics techniques to specific computer architectures and the software implements those algorithms.\nPredictive analytics applies AI models to design predictive rules which then can be used by engineers and business for forecasting or what-if analysis. For example, a company that is interested in predicting sales as a result of advertisement campaign would use predictive model to identify the best way to allocate its marketing budget or a logistics company would use a predictive model to forecast demand for shipments to estimate the number of drivers it would need in the next few months.\nArtificial Intelligence has been around for decades. In fact the term AI was coined by a famous computer scientist John McCarthy in 1955. While being tightly connected to the field of robotics for many years, the AI concepts are widely applicable in other fields, including predictive analytics. Currently, the AI is understood as a set of mathematical tools that are used to develop algorithms that can perform tasks, typically done by humans, for example, drive a car or schedule a doctor’s appointment. This set of mathematical tools include probabilistic models, machine learning algorithms and deep learning. The previous successful applications included the victory of IBM’s DeepBlue over then world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.\nTree search algorithms were developed by DeepBlue engineers to implement the chess robot. A modification was the addition of heuristics to cut branches of the tree that would not lead to a win. Those heuristics were designed by chess grand masters based on their intuition and previous experience. Vehicles in grand challenge also relied on traditional techniques such as Kalman filters and PID (proportional-integral-derivative) controllers that have been in use for many years.\nTwo distinguishing features of AI algorithms:\nA major difference between modern and historical AI algorithms is that most of the recent AI approaches rely on learning patterns from data. For example, DeepBlue algorithm was “hardcoded” and the human inputs were implemented as if-then statements by the IBM engineers. On the other hand, modern AlphaGo zero algorithm did not use any human inputs whatsoever and learned optimal strategies from a large data sets generated from self-plays. Although handcrafted systems were shown to perform well in some tasks, such as chess playing, the are hard to design for many complex applications, such as self-driving cars. On the other hand large data sets allow us to replace set of rules designed by engineers with a set of rules learned automatically from data. Thus, the learning algorithms, such as deep learning are at the core of the most of modern AI systems.\nThe main driving factor behind the growth of modern AI applications is the availability of massive and often unstructured data sets. Om the other hand, we now have appropriate computing power to develop computationally intensive AI algorithms. The three main modern AI enablers are:\nFitting complicated models to describe complicated patterns without overfitting requires millions or billions of data points. Two key ideas behind pattern-recognition systems are\nIn AI, prediction rules are often referred to as “models”. The process of using data to find a gooo prediction rule is often called “training the model”. With millions (or billions) of datapoints and fast pattern-matching skills, machines can find needles in a haystack proving insights for human health, transportation, ... etc.\nMachine learning (ML) arises from this question: could a computer go beyond “what we know how to order it to perform” and learn on its own how to perform a specified task? Could a computer surprise us? Rather than programmers crafting data-processing rules by hand, could a computer automatically learn these rules by looking at data? This question opens the door to a new programming paradigm. In classical programming, the paradigm of symbolic AI, humans input rules (a program) and data to be processed according to these rules, and out come answers. With machine learning, humans input data as well as the answers expected from the data, and out come the rules. These rules can then be applied to new data to produce original answers.\nA machine-learning system is trained rather than explicitly programmed. It’s presented with many examples relevant to a task, and it finds statistical structure in these examples that eventually allows the system to come up with rules for automating the task. For instance, if you wished to automate the task of tagging your vacation pictures, you could present a machine-learning system with many examples of pictures already tagged by humans, and the system would learn statistical rules for associating specific pictures to specific tags.\nAlthough machine learning only started to flourish in the 1990s, it has quickly become the most popular and most successful subfield of AI, a trend driven by the availability of faster hardware and larger datasets. Machine learning is tightly related to mathematical statistics, but it differs from statistics in several important ways. Unlike statistics, machine learning tends to deal with large, complex datasets (such as a dataset of millions of images, each consisting of tens of thousands of pixels) for which classical statistical analysis such as Bayesian analysis would be impractical. As a result, machine learning, and especially deep learning, exhibits comparatively little mathematical theory—maybe too little—and is engineering oriented. It’s a hands-on discipline in which ideas are proven empirically more often than theoretically.\nDeep learning DL is a type of machine learning which performs a sequence of transformations (filters) on a data. Output of each of those filters is called a factor in traditional statistical language and hidden feature in machine learning. Word deep means that there is a large number of filters that process the data. The power of this approach comes from the hierarchical nature of the model.\nThe three main factors driving AI are:\nThe widespread of mobile phones leads to generation of vast amounts of data. Besides images, users generate space and time trajectories, which are currently used to estimate and predict traffic, text messages, website clicking patterns, etc.\nDeep learning with many successful applications, has been frequently discussed in popular media. The popularity of the topic has led to hype people tend to think that deep learning techniques are capable to replace many of the human tasks, such as medical diagnostics, accountings. On the pessimistic side, people think that after a short hype, the DL techniques will disappoint and companies will stop funding R&D work on its development. However, the research on pushing this filed further is slow and it will take time before deep learning penetrates a wide range of industries. At any rate, the demand for data scientists in general and AI specialists has been increasing over the last few years with biggest markets being on silicon valley, NYC and Washington, DC(indeed 2018).\nThe field of predictive analytics was popularized by many famous competitions in which people compete to build the model with lowest prediction error. One of the first of this types of competitions was the Netflix prize. In 2009 Netflix payed $1 million to a team that developed the most accurate model for predicting movies a user would like to watch. At that time Netflix’s recommendation system generated 30 billion predictions per day. The initial goal of improving recommendation algorithm by 10 percent was overachieved by the winning team. The wining team used what is called an ensemble technique, which takes a weighted average from different prediction algorithms. Thus, the first lesson from this competition is that we typically need to build several predictive models to achieve a good results. On the other had, the model developed by the winning team was never used by Netflix due to complexity of those models and the fact that by the end of competition Netflix mostly shifted to streaming movies versus sending DVDs over mail. The second lesson is that simplicity and interpretability of models matters when they are deployed on a large scale. The third lesson, is that models need to adapt accordingly to meet the fast changing business requirements.\nDeep Learning’s (DL) growing popularity is summarized by the grown of products that Google is developing using DL. Figure 2 shows this immense growth. One key differentiating effect is that DL algorithms are scalable and can be implemented across the interned in apps such as YouTube and Gmail.\nApplications of Machine Learning/Deep Learning are endless, you just have to look at the right opportunity! There is a similar dynamics in popularity of deep learning search queries on Google. The growth is again exponential, although it is not yet close to popularity of traditional statistical techniques, such as linear regression analysis.\nMeanwhile, some ethical concurs are being raised as a result of growing popularity of AI. The most discussed thus far is the impact on the job market and many jobs being replaced by deep learning models. Although, some economic analysis (Acemoglu and Restrepo 2018) shows that while jobs displacement leads to reduced demand for labor and wages, it counteracted by a productivity effect and increases in demand for labor in non-automated tasks.\nThe algorithmic aspects of deep learning has existed for decades. In 1956, Kolmogorov has shown that any function can be represented as a superposition of univariate functions (this is exactly what deep learning does). In 1951 Robbins and Monro proposed stochastic approximations algorithms. This is the main technique for finding weights of a deep learning model today.\nBackpropagation algorithm for finding derivatives was first published and implemented by Werbos in 1974. In mid 1980s Schmidhuber studied many practical aspects of applying neural networks to real-life problems. Since the key ingredients of DL has been around for several decades, one could wonder why we observe a recent peak in popularity of those methods.\nOne of the strong driving forces is adoption of DL by internet companies that need to analyze large scale high dimensional datasets, such as human-written text, speech and images. Smartphone photography led to people uploading vast amounts of images to services like Instagram and Facebook. In 2012 more mobile devices were sold than PCs. The number of images shared on the Internet has skyrocketed as well. This can be see in products that Google is developing using DL.\nThe proliferation of smartphones globally has been one of the most dramatic technological adoptions in human history. From just 173 million smartphone users worldwide in 2010, the number exploded to over 6.8 billion users by 2023, representing nearly 86% of the global population. This exponential growth has been particularly pronounced in developing markets, where smartphones often serve as the primary gateway to the internet. Countries like India and China have seen smartphone penetration rates exceed 80%, while regions in Africa and Southeast Asia continue to show rapid adoption curves. The ubiquity of smartphones has fundamentally transformed how data is generated and consumed - these devices produce continuous streams of location data, user interactions, images, messages, and behavioral patterns that form the foundation for modern AI applications. The convergence of increasingly powerful mobile processors, high-resolution cameras, and always-on internet connectivity has created an unprecedented data generation ecosystem that feeds directly into the machine learning models powering everything from recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles.\nTherefore, data generated by Internet users creates a demand for techniques to analyze large scale data sets. Mathematical methodologies were in place for many years. One missing ingredient in the explosive nature of DL popularity is the availability of computing power. DL models are computationally hungry, trial and error process is required to build a useful model. Sometimes hundreds or thousands of different models are required to be evaluated before choosing one to be used in an application. Training models can be computationally expensive, we are usually talking about large amounts of training data that need to be analyzed to build a model.\nThe adoption rate of AI technologies, particularly generative AI like ChatGPT, has shattered all previous records for technology adoption. While it took the internet 7 years to reach 100 million users, the telephone 75 years, and television 13 years, ChatGPT achieved this milestone in just 2 months after its launch in November 2022. This unprecedented speed of adoption reflects not just the accessibility of AI tools, but also their immediate utility across diverse user needs. Unlike previous innovations that required significant infrastructure changes or learning curves, AI chatbots could be accessed through simple web interfaces and provided immediate value for tasks ranging from writing assistance to problem-solving. The viral nature of AI adoption has been further accelerated by social media demonstrations and word-of-mouth sharing of impressive AI capabilities, creating a network effect that compounds the growth rate. This rapid adoption suggests that AI represents a fundamentally different type of technological shift - one that augments human capabilities rather than replacing existing systems entirely. The chart below illustrates the explosive growth potential of AI technologies.\nThe first generation of AI models was fundamentally enabled by the availability of powerful GPU chips, which provided the parallel processing capabilities necessary to train deep neural networks on large datasets. The breakthrough in deep learning around 2012, including innovations like AlexNet for image recognition, would not have been possible without GPUs that could perform thousands of matrix operations simultaneously. Current AI models, including ChatGPT, Claude, and other large language models, continue to rely primarily on GPUs for both training and inference. Modern AI training clusters consist of thousands of interconnected GPUs working together for weeks or months to process the enormous datasets required for today’s sophisticated models. While some companies have developed specialized AI chips like Google’s TPUs, GPUs remain the dominant platform for AI development due to their versatility, widespread availability, and established software ecosystems.\nThe gaming industry was one of the earliest drivers of GPU development, as game developers demanded increasingly sophisticated graphics rendering capabilities to create immersive virtual worlds with realistic lighting, textures, and physics simulations. Companies like NVIDIA and AMD invested heavily in parallel processing architectures optimized for the matrix operations required to render complex 3D scenes in real-time. The rise of cryptocurrency mining, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, created an unexpected second wave of GPU demand as miners discovered that graphics cards were far more efficient than traditional CPUs for the repetitive hash calculations required by proof-of-work algorithms. This mining boom drove massive investments in GPU manufacturing capacity and spurred innovations in memory bandwidth and energy efficiency. More recently, the explosion of AI-generated video content has created a third major demand driver, as video generation models require enormous computational power to process and synthesize high-resolution video frames. The convergence of these three use cases - gaming graphics, cryptocurrency mining, and AI video generation - has accelerated GPU development far beyond what any single application could have achieved alone, creating the powerful hardware infrastructure that now enables training of large language models and other AI applications.\nTable 1 illustrates the dramatic evolution of GPU performance over two decades, from early graphics cards to specialized AI accelerators. The data shows exponential growth in computational power: from the modest 0.23 TeraFLOPS of the 2006 GeForce 7900 GTX to the projected 100 PetaFLOPS (FP4) of the 2027 Rubin Ultra - representing a performance increase of over 400,000x. Here FP4 is a lower precision (4-bit) floating-point arithmetic that is used for AI workloads. It is an alternative to FP32 (32-bit) floating-point arithmetic that is used for general purpose computing.\nMemory capacity has similarly exploded from 0.5GB to a projected 1TB. Modern GPUs have evolved from simple graphics processors to sophisticated AI-optimized architectures featuring specialized tensor cores, mixed-precision arithmetic (FP8/FP4), and massive high-bandwidth memory systems. The transition from traditional FP32 floating-point operations to lower-precision AI workloads (FP8/FP4) has enabled unprecedented computational throughput measured in PetaFLOPS and ExaFLOPS scales, making current and future GPUs the primary engines driving the deep learning revolution and large language model training.\nNow AI models are the main consumers of those processors. The more popular of those are ChatGPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude and Perplexity. ChatGPT-4 is based on the transformer architecture. It is able to handle long conversations and maintain better context over multiple turns. It is stronger in creative writing, technical writing, reasoning tasks, and code generation. It has better performance on logic-heavy tasks and answering technical queries. It is mainly used for chatbots, automated content creation, code writing, customer support, and more advanced AI tasks.\nOpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has experienced remarkable growth in both valuation and revenue. As of late 2024, OpenAI reached a valuation of $157 billion following its latest funding round, making it one of the most valuable private companies in the world. The company’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) has grown exponentially, reaching approximately $3.7 billion in 2024, driven primarily by ChatGPT subscriptions and API usage. OpenAI has raised over $13 billion in total funding, with major investors including Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion and maintains a strategic partnership that includes exclusive cloud computing arrangements. This rapid financial growth reflects the massive demand for generative AI capabilities across industries and the transformative potential of large language models.\nClaudeis the main competitor of OpenAI. It is supported by Amazon and excels at complex reasoning tasks, problem-solving, and in-depth analysis across a wide range of domains. Claude can write, debug, and explain code in many programming languages. It can analyze images and documents in addition to text and can engage in various conversation styles, from formal analysis to creative writing to casual discussion.\nAmazon has made a significant strategic investment in Anthropic, Claude’s creator, committing up to $4 billion to advance AI safety research and development. This partnership positions Amazon Web Services (AWS) as Anthropic’s primary cloud provider while giving Amazon a minority ownership stake in the company. Unlike ChatGPT, which excels in creative writing and general-purpose conversations, Claude is specifically designed with a focus on safety, harmlessness, and nuanced reasoning. Claude demonstrates superior performance in tasks requiring careful analysis, ethical reasoning, and handling sensitive topics. It employs Constitutional AI training methods that make it more reliable in avoiding harmful outputs and better at acknowledging uncertainty when it doesn’t know something. Recent advances in Claude 3.7 and Claude 4.0 have introduced groundbreaking multimodal capabilities, allowing these models to process and analyze images, documents, and code with unprecedented accuracy. Claude 4.0 represents a significant leap forward in mathematical reasoning, coding assistance, and complex problem-solving tasks, with performance improvements of 40-60% over previous versions in benchmark evaluations. These newer models feature enhanced “thinking” processes that are more transparent, often explaining their reasoning step-by-step with greater depth and clarity, which makes them particularly valuable for educational applications, research assistance, and professional analysis where understanding the AI’s decision-making process is crucial. Claude 4.0 also introduces improved long-context understanding, capable of processing documents up to 200,000 tokens, and demonstrates remarkable advances in scientific reasoning and technical writing. This approach has made Claude increasingly popular among researchers, academics, and professionals who require more thoughtful and contextually aware AI assistance.\nPerplexity synthesizes information from multiple sources and presents it with proper citations. Each response includes references for easy verification. It functions as a conversational search engine. Perplexity has emerged as a formidable competitor to Google Search by offering a fundamentally different approach to information discovery. Unlike traditional search engines that provide links to websites, Perplexity acts as an AI-powered research assistant that directly answers questions while citing sources. The company has attracted significant investment, including backing from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who participated in Perplexity’s $74 million Series B funding round in 2024. This strategic investment reflects growing confidence in AI-first search alternatives that could disrupt Google’s longstanding dominance in the search market.\nThe company has also developed innovative partnerships with major brands like Marriott and Nike, demonstrating how AI search can be integrated into enterprise applications. Marriott has explored using Perplexity’s technology to enhance customer service by providing instant, cited answers about hotel amenities, local attractions, and booking policies. Similarly, Nike has experimented with Perplexity’s capabilities to help customers find specific product information, sizing guides, and availability across different locations. These enterprise partnerships showcase Perplexity’s potential to move beyond general web search into specialized, domain-specific applications.\nPerplexity’s advertising model differs significantly from Google’s traditional approach. Rather than displaying ads alongside search results, Perplexity is exploring sponsored answers and branded content integration that maintains the conversational flow while clearly identifying commercial partnerships. This approach could prove less intrusive than traditional search advertising while providing new revenue streams. The company’s growth trajectory and enterprise adoption suggest it could pose a meaningful challenge to Google’s search monopoly, particularly among users who prefer direct answers over browsing multiple websites.\nThe explosive growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity has been fundamentally enabled by the vast repositories of digital text that have accumulated over the past three decades. The “fuel” powering these sophisticated AI systems comes from an unprecedented collection of human knowledge digitized and made accessible through the internet. Wikipedia alone contains over 60 million articles across hundreds of languages, representing one of humanity’s largest collaborative knowledge projects. Web crawling technologies have systematically captured billions of web pages, blog posts, news articles, and forum discussions, creating massive text corpora that encode diverse writing styles, domains of expertise, and forms of human expression. The digitization of literature through projects like Google Books and Internet Archive has made millions of books searchable and processable, from classical literature to technical manuals. Social media platforms have contributed streams of conversational text, while academic databases provide formal scientific and scholarly writing. This digital text explosion created training datasets containing trillions of words - orders of magnitude larger than what any human could read in multiple lifetimes. By processing these enormous text collections through transformer architectures, LLMs learned statistical patterns of language use, absorbing grammar, syntax, semantics, and even reasoning patterns embedded in human writing. The models discovered how words relate to each other, how concepts connect across different contexts, and how to generate coherent, contextually appropriate responses by predicting the most likely next word given preceding text. This approach allowed AI systems to develop surprisingly sophisticated language understanding and generation capabilities without explicit programming of linguistic rules, instead learning the deep structure of human communication from the collective digital footprint of our species.\nThe mathematical operations used for manipulating and rendering images are the same as those used in deep learning models. Researchers started to used graphical processing units (GPUs) (a.k.a graphics cards) to train deep learning models in 2010s. The wide availability of GPUs made deep learning modeling accessible for a large number of researchers and engineers and eventually led to popularity of DL. Recently, several competitive hardware architectures were developed by large companies like Google, which uses its own TPU (Tensor Processing Units) as well as smaller start-ups.\nThis course will focus on practical and theoretical aspects of predicting using deep learning models. Currently, deep learning techniques are almost exclusively used for image analysis and natural language processing and are practiced by a handful number of scientists and engineers with most of them being trained in computer science. However, modern methodologies, software and availability of cloud computing make deep learning accessible to a wide range of data scientists who would typically use more traditional predictive models such as generalized linear regression or tree-based methods.\nA unified approach to analyze and apply deep learning models to a wide range or problems that arise in business and engineering is required. To make this happen, we will bring together ideas from probability and statistics, optimization, scalable linear algebra and high performance computing. Although, deep learning models are very interesting to study from methodological point of view, the most important aspect of those is the predictive power unseen before with more traditional models. Ability to learn very complex patterns in data and generate accurate predictions make the deep learning a useful and exciting methodology to use, we hope to convey that excitement. This set of notes is self-contained and has a set of references for a reader interested in learning further.\nAlthough basics of probability, statistics and linear algebra will be revisited, it is targeted towards students who have completed a course in introductory statistics and high school calculus. We will make extensive use of computational tools, such as R language, as well as PyTorch and TensorFlow libraries for predictive modeling, both for illustration and in homework problems.\nThere are many aspects of data analysis that do not deal with building predictive models, for example data processing and labeling can require significant human resources(Hermann and Balso 2017; Baylor et al. 2017).\nThe landscape of Artificial Intelligence is rapidly being reshaped by the rise of Generative AI (Gen AI). As of 2025, Gen AI has moved beyond hype and into practical application across a multitude of personal and professional domains. A recent article in the Harvard Business Review, “How People Are Really Using Gen AI in 2025” by Marc Zao-Sanders, highlights this shift, noting that user interest has significantly increased and investment in AI is skyrocketing.\nThe article reveals a fascinating trend: a move from purely technical applications towards more emotive and personal uses. The top use cases in 2025 reflect this, with “Therapy/companionship” leading the list. Other prominent uses include “Organizing my life,” “Finding purpose,” “Enhanced learning,” and “Generating code (for pros).” This indicates that individuals are leveraging Gen AI not just for productivity, but also for personal development and well-being.\nSome concrete examples of how people are using Gen AI, as cited in the article, include:\nThe article also points to the increasing sophistication of Gen AI users, who are developing a deeper understanding of the technology’s capabilities and limitations, including concerns around data privacy and the potential for over-reliance.\nBelow is an image from the HBR article summarizing the top 10 use cases:\nSource: Marc Zao-Sanders, “How People Are Really Using Gen AI in 2025,” Harvard Business Review, April 9, 2025, https://hbr.org/2025/04/how-people-are-really-using-gen-ai-in-2025.\nThe continued evolution of Gen AI promises even more sophisticated applications in the future, moving from providing information to taking action (agentic behavior).\nThe computer therapist is not something new. In 1966, Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA, a computer program that could simulate a conversation with a psychotherapist. ELIZA used simple pattern matching to respond to user inputs, creating the illusion of understanding.

One can imagine that after the machine had been operating for some time, the instructions would have altered out of all recognition, but nevertheless still be such that one would have to admit that the machine was still doing very worthwhile calculations. Possibly it might still be getting results of the type desired when the machine was first set up, but in a much more efficient manner. In such a case one would have to admit that the progress of the machine had not been foreseen when its original instructions were put in. It would be like a pupil who had learnt much from his master, but had added much more by his own work. When this happens I feel that one is obliged to regard the machine as showing intelligence.” – Alan Turing\n\nPeople, organizations and markets. AI does the organization and hence connects people to markets faster and simplesly. Hence it creates economic values.

He describes this new era as “Software 3.0,” where natural language becomes the primary programming interface and LLMs act as a new kind of computer and compares it to the previous generations of software development approaches sumamrised in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParadigm\n“Program” is…\nDeveloper’s main job\nCanonical depot\n\n\n\n\nSoftware 1.0\nHand-written code\nWrite logic\nGitHub\n\n\nSoftware 2.0\nNeural-net weights\nCurate data & train\nHugging Face / Model Atlas\n\n\nSoftware 3.0\nNatural-language prompts\nCompose/police English instructions\nPrompt libraries\n\n\n\nCurrenlty LLMs are collaborative partners that can augment human abilities, democratizing software creation and allowing people without traditional programming backgrounds to build complex applications simply by describing what they want in plain English.\nPolson and Scott (2018) have predicted that human-machine interaction will be the next frontier of AI.\nOlga sais that humans are callable function.\nThe same will happen to university professors. They will become lablers for content. And simply will be responsible for clicking yes, when content is appropriate and no, when it is not.\nHal Varian’s 2010 paper “Computer Mediated Transactions” Varian (2010) provides a foundational framework for understanding how computers can automate routine tasks and decision-making processes, reducing transaction costs and increasing efficiency. This includes automated pricing, inventory management, and customer service systems. He talks about system that can coordinate between multiple parties by providing real-time information sharing and communication platforms. This enables more complex multi-party transactions and supply chain management.\nThis framework remains highly relevant for understanding modern AI and machine learning applications in business, as these technologies represent the next evolution of computer-mediated transactions, enabling even more sophisticated automation, coordination, and communication capabilities.\nIn his talk on “Why are LLMs not Better at Finding Proofs?”, Timothy Gowers discusses that while large language models (LLMs) can display some sensible reasoning—such as narrowing down the search space in a problem—they tend to falter when they get stuck, relying too heavily on intelligent guesswork rather than systematic problem-solving. Unlike humans, who typically respond to a failed attempt with a targeted adjustment based on what went wrong, LLMs often just make another guess that isn’t clearly informed by previous failures. He also highlights a key difference in approach: humans usually build up to a solution incrementally, constructing examples that satisfy parts of the problem and then refining their approach based on the requirements. For example, when trying to prove an existential statement, a human might first find examples satisfying one condition, then look for ways to satisfy additional conditions, adjusting parameters as needed. LLMs, by contrast, are more likely to skip these intermediate steps and try to jump directly to the final answer, missing the structured, iterative reasoning that characterizes human problem-solving.\nWhile there are indeed limitations to what current large language models can solve, particularly in areas requiring systematic mathematical reasoning, they continue to demonstrate remarkable capabilities in solving complex problems through alternative approaches. A notable example is the application of deep learning to the classical three-body problem in physics, a problem that has challenged mathematicians and physicists for centuries. Traditional analytical methods have struggled to find closed-form solutions for the three-body problem, but deep neural networks have shown surprising success in approximating solutions through pattern recognition and optimization techniques. These neural networks can learn the underlying dynamics from training data and generate accurate predictions for orbital trajectories, even when analytical solutions remain elusive. This success demonstrates that the trial-and-error approach, when combined with sophisticated pattern recognition capabilities, can lead to practical solutions for problems that have resisted traditional mathematical approaches. The key insight is that while these methods may not provide the elegant closed-form solutions that mathematicians prefer, they offer valuable computational tools that can advance scientific understanding and enable practical applications in fields ranging from astrophysics to spacecraft navigation.\n\n\n\n\nAcemoglu, Daron, and Pascual Restrepo. 2018. “Artificial Intelligence, Automation and Work.” National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\n\nBaylor, Denis, Eric Breck, Heng-Tze Cheng, Noah Fiedel, Chuan Yu Foo, Zakaria Haque, Salem Haykal, et al. 2017. “Tfx: A Tensorflow-Based Production-Scale Machine Learning Platform.” In Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 1387–95.

    "section": "",
    "text": "1.1 Normal Means Problem\nAs we have seen in the previous chapters, the development of learning from data algorithms has been driven by two fundamental paradigms: the classical frequentist approach centered around maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and the Bayesian approach grounded in decision theory. This chapter explores how these seemingly distinct methodologies converge in the modern theory of AI, particularly through the lens of regularization and model selection.\nMaximum likelihood estimation represents the cornerstone of classical statistical inference. Given observed data \\(\\mathcal{D} = \\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^n\\) and a parametric model \\(f_{\\theta}(x)\\), the MLE principle seeks to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function: \\[\n\\hat{\\theta}_{MLE} = \\arg\\max_{\\theta} \\mathcal{L}(\\theta; \\mathcal{D}) = \\arg\\max_{\\theta} \\prod_{i=1}^n p(y_i | x_i, \\theta)\n\\]\nThis approach has several appealing properties: it provides consistent estimators under mild conditions, achieves the Cramér-Rao lower bound asymptotically, and offers a principled framework for parameter estimation. However, MLE has well-documented limitations, particularly in high-dimensional settings MLE can lead to overfitting, poor generalization, and numerical instability. Furthermore, as was shown by Stein’s paradox, MLE can be inadmissible. Meaning, there are other estimators that have lower risk than the MLE. We will start this chapter with the normal means problem and show how MLE can be inadmissible.\nConsider the vector of means case where \\(\\theta = (\\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_p)\\). We have \\[\ny_i \\mid \\theta_i \\sim N(\\theta_i, \\sigma^2), ~ i=1,\\ldots,p &gt; 2\n\\tag{1.1}\\]\nThe goal is to estimate the vector of means \\(\\theta = (\\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_p)\\) and we can achieve this by borrowing strength across the observations. This is also a proxy for non-parametric regression, where \\(\\theta_i = f(x_i)\\). Also typically \\(y_i\\) is a mean of \\(n\\) observations, i.e. \\(y_i = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=1}^n x_{ij}\\). Much has been written on the properties of the Bayes risk as a function of \\(n\\) and \\(p\\). Much work has also been done on the asymptotic properties of the Bayes risk as \\(n\\) and \\(p\\) grow to infinity.\nThe goal is to estimate the vector \\(\\theta\\) using a squared loss \\[\n\\mathcal{L}(\\theta, \\hat{\\theta}) = \\sum_{i=1}^p (\\theta_i - \\hat{\\theta}_i)^2,\n\\] where \\(\\hat \\theta\\) is the vector of estimates. Now, we will compare the MLE estimate and what is called the James-Stein estimate. A principled way to evaluate the performance of an estimator is to average its loss over the data, this metric is called the risk. The MLE estimate \\(\\hat \\theta_{i} = y_i\\) has a constant risk \\(p\\) \\[\nR(\\theta,\\hat \\theta ) = \\E[y]{\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\theta, \\hat \\theta\\right) } = p.\n\\] Here expectation is over the data given by distribution Equation 1.1. The estimate is map (rule) from the data to the parameter space \\(\\hat \\theta = \\hat \\theta(y)\\).\nBayesian inference offers a fundamentally different perspective by incorporating prior knowledge and quantifying uncertainty through probability distributions. The Bayesian approach begins with a prior distribution \\(p(\\theta)\\) over the parameter space and updates this belief using Bayes’ rule: \\[\np(\\theta | y) = \\frac{p(y | \\theta) p(\\theta)}{p(y)}\n\\]\nThe Bayes estimator is the value \\(\\hat \\theta^{B}\\) that minimizes the Bayes risk, the expected loss: \\[\n\\hat \\theta^{B} = \\arg\\min_{\\hat \\theta(y)} R(\\pi, \\hat \\theta(y))\n\\] Here \\(\\pi\\) is the prior distribution of \\(\\theta\\) and \\(R(\\pi, \\hat \\theta(y))\\) is the Bayes risk defined as: \\[\nR(\\pi, \\hat{\\theta}(y)) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\theta \\sim \\pi} \\left[ \\mathbb{E}_{y\\mid \\theta} \\left[ \\mathcal{L}(\\theta, \\hat{\\theta}(y)) \\right] \\right].\n\\tag{1.2}\\] For squared error loss, this yields the posterior mean \\(\\E{\\theta \\mid y}\\), while for absolute error loss, it gives the posterior median.\nFor the normal means problem with squared error loss, this becomes: \\[\nR(\\pi, \\hat{\\theta}(y)) = \\int \\left( \\int (\\theta - \\hat{\\theta}(y))^2 p(y|\\theta) dy \\right) \\pi(\\theta) d\\theta\n\\]\nThe Bayes risk quantifies the expected performance of an estimator, taking into account both the uncertainty in the data and the prior uncertainty about the parameter. It serves as a benchmark for comparing different estimators: an estimator with lower Bayes risk is preferred under the chosen prior and loss function. In particular, the Bayes estimator achieves the minimum possible Bayes risk for the given prior and loss.\nIn 1961, James and Stein exhibited an estimator of the mean of a multivariate normal distribution that has uniformly lower mean squared error than the sample mean. This estimator is reviewed briefly in an empirical Bayes context. Stein’s rule and its generalizations are then applied to predict baseball averages, to estimate toxomosis prevalence rates, and to estimate the exact size of Pearson’s chi-square test with results from a computer simulation.\nIn each of these examples, the mean square error of these rules is less than half that of the sample mean. This result is paradoxical because it contradicts the elementary law of statistical theory. The philosophical implications of Stein’s paradox are also significant. It has influenced the development of shrinkage estimators and has connections to Bayesianism and model selection criteria.\nStein’s phenomenon where \\(y_i \\mid \\theta_i \\sim N(\\theta_i, 1)\\) and \\(\\theta_i \\sim N(0, \\tau^2)\\) where \\(\\tau \\rightarrow \\infty\\) illustrates this point well. MLE approach is equivalent to use of the improper “non-informative” uniform prior and leads to an estimator with poor risk property.\nLet \\(\\|y\\| = \\sum_{i=1}^p y_i^2\\). Then, we can make the following probabilistic statements from the model, \\[\nP\\left( \\| y \\| &gt; \\| \\theta \\| \\right) &gt; \\frac{1}{2}\n\\] Now for the posterior, this inequality is reversed under a flat Lebesgue measure, \\[\nP\\left( \\| \\theta \\| &gt; \\| y \\| \\mid  y \\right) &gt; \\frac{1}{2}\n\\] which is in conflict with the classical statement. This is a property of the prior which leads to a poor rule (the overall average) and risk.\nThe shrinkage rule (a.k.a. normal prior) where \\(\\tau^2\\) is “estimated” from the data avoids this conflict. More precisely, we have \\[\n\\hat{\\theta}(y) = \\left( 1 - \\frac{k-2}{\\|y\\|^2} \\right) y \\quad \\text{and} \\quad E\\left( \\| \\hat{\\theta} - \\theta \\| \\right) &lt; k, \\; \\forall \\theta.\n\\] Hence, when \\(\\|y\\|^2\\) is small the shrinkage factor is more extreme. For example, if \\(k=10\\), \\(\\|y\\|^2=12\\), then \\(\\hat{\\theta} = (1/3) y\\). Now we have the more intuitive result that \\(P\\left(\\|\\theta\\| &gt; \\|y\\| \\; | \\; y\\right) &lt; \\frac{1}{2}\\).\nThis shows that careful specification of default priors matter in high dimensions is necessary.\nThe resulting estimator is called the James-Stein estimator and is a shrinkage estimator that shrinks the MLE towards the prior mean. The prior mean is typically the sample mean of the data. The James-Stein estimator is given by \\[\n\\hat \\theta_{i}^{JS} = (1 - \\lambda) \\hat \\theta_{i}^{MLE} + \\lambda \\bar y,\n\\] where \\(\\lambda\\) is a shrinkage parameter and \\(\\bar y\\) is the sample mean of the data. The shrinkage parameter is typically chosen to minimize the risk of the estimator.\nThe key idea behind James-Stein shrinkage is that one can “borrow strength” across components. In this sense the multivariate parameter estimation problem is easier than the univariate one.\nFollowing Efron and Morris (1975), we can view the James-Stein estimator through the lens of empirical Bayes methodology. Efron and Morris demonstrate that Stein’s seemingly paradoxical result has a natural interpretation when viewed as an empirical Bayes procedure that estimates the prior distribution from the data itself.\nConsider the hierarchical model: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_i | \\theta_i &\\sim N(\\theta_i, \\sigma^2) \\\\\n\\theta_i | \\mu, \\tau^2 &\\sim N(\\mu, \\tau^2)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe marginal distribution of \\(y_i\\) is then \\(y_i \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2 + \\tau^2)\\). In the empirical Bayes approach, we estimate the hyperparameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\tau^2\\) from the marginal likelihood:\n\\[\nm(y | \\mu, \\tau^2) = \\prod_{i=1}^p \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi(\\sigma^2 + \\tau^2)}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y_i - \\mu)^2}{2(\\sigma^2 + \\tau^2)}\\right)\n\\]\nThe maximum marginal likelihood estimators are: \\[\n\\hat{\\mu} = \\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{p}\\sum_{i=1}^p y_i\n\\] \\[\n\\hat{\\tau}^2 = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{1}{p}\\sum_{i=1}^p (y_i - \\bar{y})^2 - \\sigma^2\\right)\n\\]\nThe empirical Bayes estimator then becomes: \\[\n\\hat{\\theta}_i^{EB} = \\frac{\\hat{\\tau}^2}{\\sigma^2 + \\hat{\\tau}^2} y_i + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sigma^2 + \\hat{\\tau}^2} \\hat{\\mu}\n\\]\nThis can be rewritten as: \\[\n\\hat{\\theta}_i^{EB} = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sigma^2 + \\hat{\\tau}^2}\\right) y_i + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sigma^2 + \\hat{\\tau}^2} \\bar{y}\n\\]\nWhen \\(\\mu = 0\\) and using the estimate \\(\\hat{\\tau}^2 = \\max(0, \\|y\\|^2/p - \\sigma^2)\\), this reduces to a form closely related to the James-Stein estimator: \\[\n\\hat{\\theta}_i^{JS} = \\left(1 - \\frac{(p-2)\\sigma^2}{\\|y\\|^2}\\right) y_i\n\\]\nEfron and Morris show that the empirical Bayes interpretation provides insight into why the James-Stein estimator dominates the MLE. The key insight is that the MLE implicitly assumes an improper flat prior \\(\\pi(\\theta) \\propto 1\\), which leads to poor risk properties in high dimensions.\nThe risk of the MLE is constant and can be calculated via the classic bias-variance tradeoff \\[\nR(\\theta,\\hat \\theta) = \\E[y\\mid \\theta]{\\Vert \\hat \\theta - \\theta \\Vert^2} = \\Vert \\hat \\theta - \\theta \\Vert^2 + \\E[y|\\theta]{\\Vert \\hat \\theta - \\mathbb{E}(\\hat \\theta) \\Vert^2} =  p\\sigma^2\n\\]\nBayes risk of the James-Stein estimator can also be explicitly calculated due to the conjugacy of the normal prior and likelihood \\[\nR(\\theta, \\hat{\\theta}^{JS}) = p\\sigma^2 - (p-2)\\sigma^2 \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\|\\theta + \\epsilon\\|^2/\\sigma^2}\\right]\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 I)\\). Since the second term is always positive, we have: \\[\nR(\\theta, \\hat{\\theta}^{JS}) &lt; R(\\theta, \\hat{\\theta}^{MLE}) \\quad \\forall \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^p, \\quad p \\geq 3\n\\]\nThis uniform domination demonstrates the inadmissibility of the MLE under squared error loss for \\(p \\geq 3\\).\nIn an applied problem the gap in risk between MLE and JS estimators can be large. For example, in the normal means problem with \\(p=100\\) and \\(n=100\\), the risk of the MLE is \\(R(\\theta,\\hat \\theta_{MLE}) = 100\\) while the risk of the JS estimator is \\(R(\\theta,\\hat \\theta_{JS}) = 1.5\\). The JS estimator is 67 times more efficient than the MLE. The JS estimator is also minimax optimal in the sense that it attains the minimax risk bound for the normal means problem. The minimax risk bound is the smallest risk that can be attained by any estimator.\nThe James-Stein estimator illustrates how incorporating prior information (via shrinkage) can lead to estimators with lower overall risk compared to the MLE, especially in high-dimensional settings. However, it is not the only shrinkage estimator that dominates the MLE. Other shrinkage estimators, such as the ridge regression estimator, also have lower risk than the MLE. The key insight is that shrinkage estimators can leverage prior information to improve estimation accuracy, especially in high-dimensional settings.\nNote, that we used the empirical Bayes version of the definition of risk. Full Bayes approach incorporates both the data and the prior distribution of the parameter as in Equation 1.2.",

    "text": "Sparsity\nLet the true parameter be sparse have the of \\(\\theta_p = \\left ( \\sqrt{d/p} , \\ldots , \\sqrt{d/p} , 0 , \\ldots , 0 \\right )\\). The problem of recovering a vector with many zero entries is called the sparse signal recovery. The “ultra-sparse” or “nearly black” vector case occurs when \\(p_n\\), denoting the number of non-zero parameter values, and for \\(\\theta \\in l_0 [ p_n]\\), which denotes the set \\(\\# ( \\theta_i \\neq 0 ) \\leq p_n\\) where \\(p_n = o(n)\\) where \\(p_n \\rightarrow \\infty\\) as \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\).\nHigh-dimensional predictor selection and sparse signal recovery are routine statistical and machine learning tasks and is a challange for classical statistical methods. From a historical perspective, James-Stein (a.k.a \\(\\ell_2\\)-regularisation, Stein (1964)) is only a global shrinkage rule–in the sense that there are no local parameters to learn about sparsity and has issue recovering sparse signals.\nJames-Stein is equivalent to the model \\[\ny_i = \\theta_i + \\epsilon_i \\; \\mathrm{ and} \\; \\theta_i \\sim \\mathcal{N} \\left ( 0 , \\tau^2 \\right )\n\\] For the sparse \\(r\\)-spike problem \\(\\hat \\theta_{JS}\\) performs poorly and we require a different rule.\nFor \\(\\theta_p\\) we have \\[\n\\frac{p \\Vert \\theta \\Vert^2}{p + \\Vert \\theta \\Vert^2} \\leq R \\left ( \\hat{\\theta}^{JS} , \\theta_p \\right ) \\leq\n2 + \\frac{p \\Vert \\theta \\Vert^2}{ d + \\Vert \\theta \\Vert^2}.\n\\] This implies that \\(R \\left ( \\hat{\\theta}^{JS} , \\theta_p \\right ) \\geq (p/2)\\).\nIn the sparse case a simple threshholding rule can beat MLE and JS, when the signal is sparse. The thresholding estimator is \\[\n\\hat \\theta_{thr} = \\left \\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\hat \\theta_i & \\mbox{if} \\; \\hat \\theta_i &gt; \\sqrt{2 \\ln p} \\\\ 0 & \\mbox{otherwise} \\end{array} \\right .\n\\] This simple example, shows that the choice of penalty should not be taken for granted as different estimators will have different risk profiles.\nA horseshoe (HS) prior is another example of a shrinkage prior that inherits good MSE properties but also simultaneously provides asymptotic minimax estimation risk for sparse signals.\nOne such estimator that achieves the optimal minimax rate is the horseshoe estimator proposed by Carvalho, Polson, and Scott (2010). It is a local shrinkage estimator. The horseshoe prior is particularly effective for sparse signals, as it allows for strong shrinkage of noise while preserving signals. The horseshoe prior is defined as: \\[\n\\theta_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 \\tau^2 \\lambda_i^2), \\quad \\lambda_i \\sim C^+(0, 1), \\quad \\tau \\sim C^+(0, 1)\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\lambda_i\\) is a local shrinkage parameter, and \\(\\tau\\) is a global shrinkage parameter. The half-Cauchy distribution \\(C^+\\) ensures heavy tails, allowing for adaptive shrinkage. We will discuss the horseshoe prior in more detail later in this section.\nHS estimator uniformly dominates the traditional sample mean estimator in MSE and has good posterior concentration properties for nearly black objects. Specifically, the horseshoe estimator attains asymptotically minimax risk rate \\[\n\\sup_{ \\theta \\in l_0[p_n] } \\;\n\\mathbb{E}_{ y | \\theta } \\|\\hat y_{hs} - \\theta \\|^2 \\asymp\np_n \\log \\left ( n / p_n \\right ).\n\\] The “worst’’ \\(\\theta\\) is obtained at the maximum difference between \\(\\left| \\hat \\theta_{HS} - y \\right|\\) where \\(\\hat \\theta_{HS} = \\mathbb{E}(\\theta|y)\\) can be interpreted as a Bayes posterior mean (optimal under Bayes MSE).\n\nExample 1.1 (Example: James-Stein for Baseball Batting Averages) We reproduce the baseball batting average example from Efron and Morris (1977).

This can be done by maximising the marginal likelihood \\(m(y \\mid \\tau )\\) with respect to \\(\\tau\\). The resulting estimator is called the type II maximum likelihood estimator (MMLE). \\[\n\\hat{\\tau} = \\arg \\max \\log m( y \\mid \\tau ).\n\\]\nFor example, in the normal-normal model, when \\(\\theta \\sim N(\\mu,\\tau^2)\\) with \\(\\mu=0\\), we can integrate out the high dimensional \\(\\theta\\) and find \\(m(y | \\tau)\\) in closed form as \\(y_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 + \\tau^2)\\) \\[\nm( y | \\tau ) = ( 2 \\pi)^{-n/2} ( \\sigma^2 + \\tau^2 )^{- n/2}  \\exp \\left ( - \\frac{ \\sum y_i^2 }{ 2 ( \\sigma^2 + \\tau^2) } \\right )\n\\] The original JS estimator shrinks to zero and estimates prior variance using empirical Bayes (marginal MLE or Type II MLE). Efron and Morris and Lindley showed that you want o shrink to overall mean \\(\\bar y\\) and in this approach \\[\n\\theta \\sim N(\\mu,\\tau^2).\n\\] The original JS is \\(\\mu=0\\). To estimate the \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\tau\\) you can do full Bayes or empirical Bayes that shrinks to overall grand mean \\(\\bar y\\), which serves as the estimate of the original prior mean \\(\\mu\\). It seems paradoxical that you estimate proper from the data. However, this is not the case. You simply use mixture prior Diaconis and Ylvisaker (1983) with marginal MLE (MMLE). The MMLE is the product \\[\n\\int_{\\theta_i}\\prod_{i=1}^k p(\\bar y_i \\mid \\theta_i)p(\\theta_i \\mid \\mu, \\tau^2).\n\\]\nThe motivation for the shrinkage prior rather than a flat uniform prior are the following probabilistic arguments. They have an ability to balance signal detection and noise suppression in high-dimensional settings. Unlike flat uniform priors, shrinkage priors adaptively shrink small signals towards zero while preserving large signals. This behavior is crucial for sparse estimation problems, where most parameters are expected to be zero or near-zero. The James-Stein procedure is an example of global shrinkage, when the overall sparsity level across all parameters is controlled, ensuring that the majority of parameters are shrunk towards zero. Later in this section we will discuss local shrinkage priors, such as the horseshoe prior, which allow individual parameters to escape shrinkage if they represent significant signals.\nIn summary, flat uniform priors (MLE) fail to provide adequate regularization in high-dimensional settings, leading to poor risk properties and overfitting. By incorporating probabilistic arguments and hierarchical structures, shrinkage priors offer a principled approach to regularization that aligns with Bayesian decision theory and modern statistical practice.",

    "section": "1.2 Maximum Aposteriori Estimation (MAP) and Regularization",
    "text": "1.2 Maximum Aposteriori Estimation (MAP) and Regularization\nIn the previous sections, we have seen how the Bayesian approach provides a principled framework for parameter estimation through the use of prior distributions and the minimization of Bayes risk. However, in many practical scenarios, we may not have access to a full Bayesian model or the computational resources to perform Bayesian inference. This is where the concept of MAP or regularization comes into play. It also sometimes called a poor man’s Bayesian approach.\nGiven input-output pairs \\((x_i,y_i)\\), MAP learns the funvtion \\(f\\) that maps inputs \\(x_i\\) to outputs \\(y_i\\) by minimizing \\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^N  \\mathcal{L}(y_i,f(x_i)) + \\lambda \\phi(f) \\rightarrow \\text{minimize}_{f}.\n\\] The first term is the loss function that measures the difference between the predicted output \\(f(x_i)\\) and the true output \\(y_i\\). The second term is a regularization term that penalizes complex functions \\(f\\) to prevent overfitting. The parameter \\(\\lambda\\) controls the trade-off between fitting the data well and keeping the function simple. In the case when \\(f\\) is a parametric model, then we simply replace \\(f\\) with the parameters \\(\\theta\\) of the model, and the regularization term becomes a penalty on the parameters.\nThe loss is simply a negative log-likelihood from a probabilistic model specified for the data generating process. For example, when \\(y\\) is numeric and \\(y_i \\mid x_i \\sim N(f(x_i),\\sigma^2)\\), we get the squared loss \\(\\mathcal{L}(y,f(x)) = (y-f(x))^2\\). When \\(y_i\\in \\{0,1\\}\\) is binary, we use the logistic loss \\(\\mathcal{L}(y,f(x)) = \\log(1+\\exp(-yf(x)))\\).\nThe penalty term \\(\\lambda \\phi(f)\\) discourages complex functions \\(f\\). Then, we can think of regularization as a technique to incorporate some prior knowledge about parameters of the model into the estimation process. Consider an example when regularization allows us to solve a hard problem of filtering noisy traffic data.\n\nExample 1.2 (Traffic) Consider traffic flow speed measured by an in-ground sensor installed on interstate I-55 near Chicago. Speed measurements are noisy and prone to have outliers. Figure 1.1 shows speed measured data, averaged over five minute intervals on one of the weekdays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Speed profile over 24 hour period on I-55, on October 22, 2013\n\n\n\nThe statistical model is \\[\ny_t = f_t + \\epsilon_t, ~ \\epsilon_t \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2), ~ t=1,\\ldots,n,\n\\] where \\(y_t\\) is the speed measurement at time \\(t\\), \\(f_t\\) is the true underlying speed at time \\(t\\), and \\(\\epsilon_t\\) is the measurement noise. There are two sources of noise. The first is the measurement noise, caused by inhalant nature of the sensor’s hardware. The second source is due to sampling error, vehicles observed on a specific lane where senor installed might not represent well traffic in other lanes. A naive MLE approach woule be to estimate the speed profile \\(f = (f_1, \\ldots, f_n)\\) by minimizing the squared loss \\[\n\\hat f = \\arg\\min_{f} \\sum_{t=1}^{n} (y_t - f_t)^2.\n\\] However, the minima of this loss function is 0 and corresponds to the case when \\(\\hat f_t = y_t\\) for all \\(t\\). We have learned nothing about the speed profile, and the estimate is simply the noisy observation \\(y_t\\). In this case, we have no way to distinguish between the true speed profile and the noise.\nHowever, we can use regularization and bring some prior knowledge about traffic speed profiles to improve the estimate of the speed profile and to remove the noise.\nSpecifically, we will use a trend filtering approach. Under this approach, we assume that the speed profile \\(f\\) is a piece-wise linear function of time, and we want to find a function that captures the underlying trend while ignoring the noise. The regularization term \\(\\phi(f)\\) is then the second difference of the speed profile, \\[\n\\lambda \\sum_{t=1}^{n-1}|f_{t-1} - 2f_t + f_{t+1}|\n\\] which penalizes the “kinks” in the speed profile. The value of this penalty is zero, when \\(f_{t-1}, f_t, f_{t+1}\\) lie on a straight line, and it increases when the speed profile has a kink. The parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is a regularization parameter that controls the strength of the penalty.\nTrend filtering penalized function is then \\[\n(1/2) \\sum_{t=1}^{n}(y_t - f_t)^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{t=1}^{n-1}|f_{t-1} - 2f_t + f_{t+1}|,\n\\] which is a variation of a well-know Hodrick-Prescott filter.\nThis approach requires us to choose the regularization parameter \\(\\lambda\\). A small value of \\(\\lambda\\) will lead to a function that fits the data well, but may not capture the underlying trend. A large value of \\(\\lambda\\) will lead to a function that captures the underlying trend, but may not fit the data well. The optimal value of \\(\\lambda\\) can be chosen using cross-validation or other model selection techniques. The left panel of Figure 1.2 shows the trend filtering for different values of \\(\\lambda \\in \\{5,50,500\\}\\). The right panel shows the optimal value of \\(\\lambda\\) chosen by cross-validation (by visual inspection).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrend filter for different penalty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrend filtering with optimal penalty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Trend Filtering for Traffic Speed Data\n\n\n\n\n\nMAP as a Poor Man’s Bayesian\nThere is a duality between using regularization term in optimisation problem and assuming a prior distribution over the parameters of the model \\(f\\). Given the likelihood \\(L(y_i,f(x_i))\\), the posterior is given by Bayes’ rule: \\[\np(f \\mid y_i, x_i) = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^n L(y_i,f(x_i)) p(f)}{p(y_i \\mid x_i)}.\n\\] If we take the negative log of this posterior, we get: \\[\n-\\log p(f \\mid y_i, x_i) = - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log L(y_i,f(x_i)) - \\log p(f) + \\log p(y_i \\mid x_i).\n\\] Since loss is the negative log-likelihood \\(-\\log L(y_i,f(x_i))  = \\mathcal{L}(y_i,f(x_i))\\), the posterior maximization is equivalent to minimizing the following regularized loss function: \\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathcal{L}(y_i,f(x_i)) - \\log p(f).\n\\] The last term \\(\\log p(y_i \\mid x_i)\\) does not depend on \\(f\\) and can be ignored in the optimization problem. Thus, the equivalence is given by: \\[\n\\lambda \\phi(f) = -\\log p(f),\n\\] where \\(\\phi(f)\\) is the penalty term that corresponds to the prior distribution of \\(f\\). Below we will consider several choices for the prior distribution of \\(f\\) and the corresponding penalty term \\(\\phi(f)\\) commonly used in practice.",

    "text": "1.3 Ridge Regression (\\(\\ell_2\\) Norm)\nThe ridge regression uses a gaussian prior on the parameters of the model \\(f\\), which leads to a squared penalty term. Specifically, we assume that the parameters \\(\\beta\\) of the model \\(f(x) = x^T\\beta\\) are distributed as: \\[\n\\beta \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 I),\n\\] where \\(I\\) is the identity matrix. The prior distribution of \\(\\beta\\) is a multivariate normal distribution with mean 0 and covariance \\(\\sigma^2 I\\). The negative log of this prior distribution is given by: \\[\n-\\log p(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\|\\beta||_2^2 + \\text{const},\n\\] where \\(\\|\\beta||_2^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j^2\\) is the squared 2-norm of the vector \\(\\beta\\). The regularization term \\(\\phi(f)\\) is then given by: \\[\n\\phi(f) = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\|\\beta||_2^2.  \n\\] This leads to the following optimization problem: \\[\n\\underset{\\beta}{\\mathrm{minimize}}\\quad ||y- X\\beta||_2^2 + \\lambda ||\\beta||_2^2,\n\\] where \\(\\lambda = 1/\\sigma^2\\) is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of the prior. The solution to this optimization problem is given by: \\[\n\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{ridge}} = ( X^T X + \\lambda I )^{-1} X^T y.\n\\] The regularization parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is related to the variance of the prior distribution. When \\(\\lambda=0\\), the function \\(f\\) is the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters. When \\(\\lambda\\) is large, the function \\(f\\) is the prior mean of the parameters. When \\(\\lambda\\) is infinite, the function \\(f\\) is the prior mode of the parameters.\nNotice, that the OLS estimate (invented by Gauss) is a special case of ridge regression when \\(\\lambda = 0\\): \\[\n\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{OLS}} = ( X^T X )^{-1} X^T y.\n\\]\nThe original motivation for ridge regularisation was to address the problem of numerical instability in the OLS solution when the design matrix \\(X\\) is ill-conditioned, i.e. when \\(X^T X\\) is close to singular. In this case, the OLS solution can be very sensitive to small perturbations in the data, leading to large variations in the estimated coefficients \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\). This is particularly problematic when the number of features \\(p\\) is large, as the condition number of \\(X^T X\\) can grow rapidly with \\(p\\). The ridge regression solution stabilizes the OLS solution by adding a small positive constant \\(\\lambda\\) to the diagonal of the \\(X^T X\\) matrix, which improves the condition number and makes the solution more robust to noise in the data. The additional term \\(\\lambda I\\) simply shifts the eigenvalues of \\(X^T X\\) away from zero, thus improving the numerical stability of the inversion.\nAnother way to think and write the objective function of Ridge as the following constrained optimization problem: \\[\n\\underset{\\beta}{\\mathrm{minimize}}\\quad ||y- X\\beta||_2^2 \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad ||\\beta||_2^2 \\leq t,\n\\] where \\(t\\) is a positive constant that controls the size of the coefficients \\(\\beta\\). This formulation emphasizes the idea that ridge regression is a form of regularization that constrains the size of the coefficients, preventing them from growing too large and leading to overfitting. The constraint \\(||\\beta||_2^2 \\leq t\\) can be interpreted as a budget on the size of the coefficients, where larger values of \\(t\\) allow for larger coefficients and more complex models.\nConstraint on the model parameters (and the original Ridge estimator) was proposed by Tikhonov et al. (1943) for solving inverse problems to “discover” physical laws from observations. The norm of the \\(\\beta\\) vector would usually represent amount of energy required. Many processes in nature are energy minimizing!\nAgain, the tuning parameter \\(\\lambda\\) controls trade-off between how well model fits the data and how small \\(\\beta\\)s are. Different values of \\(\\lambda\\) will lead to different models. We select \\(\\lambda\\) using cross validation.\n\nExample 1.3 (Shrinkage) Consider a simulated data with \\(n=50\\), \\(p=30\\), and \\(\\sigma^2=1\\). The true model is linear with \\(10\\) large coefficients between \\(0.5\\) and \\(1\\).\nOur approximators \\(\\hat f_{\\beta}\\) is a linear regression. We can empirically calculate the bias by calculating the empirical squared loss \\(1/n||y -\\hat y||_2^2\\) and variance can be empirically calculated as \\(1/n\\sum  (\\bar{\\hat{y}} - \\hat y_i)\\)\nBias squared \\(\\mathrm{Bias}(\\hat{y})^2=0.006\\) and variance \\(\\Var{\\hat{y}} =0.627\\). Thus, the prediction error = \\(1 + 0.006 + 0.627 = 1.633\\)\nWe’ll do better by shrinking the coefficients to reduce the variance. Let’s estimate, how big a gain will we get with Ridge?\n\n\n\nTrue model coefficients\n\n\nNow we see the accuracy of the model as a function of \\(\\lambda\\)\n\n\n\nPrediction error as a function of \\(\\lambda\\)\n\n\nRidge Regression At best: Bias squared \\(=0.077\\) and variance \\(=0.402\\).\nPrediction error = \\(1 + 0.077 + 0.403 = 1.48\\)\n\n\n\nRidge\n\n\n\n\nKernel View of Ridge Regression\nAnother interesting view stems from what is called the push-through matrix identity: \\[\n(aI + UV)^{-1}U = U(aI + VU)^{-1}\n\\] for \\(a\\), \\(U\\), \\(V\\) such that the products are well-defined and the inverses exist. We can obtain this from \\(U(aI + VU) = (aI + UV)U\\), followed by multiplication by \\((aI + UV)^{-1}\\) on the left and the right. Applying the identity above to the ridge regression solution with \\(a = \\lambda\\), \\(U = X^T\\), and \\(V = X\\), we obtain an alternative form for the ridge solution: \\[\n\\hat{\\beta} = X^T (XX^T + \\lambda I)^{-1} Y.\n\\] This is often referred to as the kernel form of the ridge estimator. From this, we can see that the ridge fit can be expressed as \\[\nX\\hat{\\beta} = XX^T (XX^T + \\lambda I)^{-1} Y.\n\\] What does this remind you of? This is precisely \\(K(K + \\lambda I)^{-1}Y\\) where \\(K = XX^T\\), which, recall, is the fit from RKHS regression with a linear kernel \\(k(x, z) = x^T z\\). Therefore, we can think of RKHS regression as generalizing ridge regression by replacing the standard linear inner product with a general kernel. (Indeed, RKHS regression is often called kernel ridge regression.) \\[\n(aI + UV)^{-1}U = U(aI + VU)^{-1}\n\\] for \\(a\\), \\(U\\), \\(V\\) such that the products are well-defined and the inverses exist. We can obtain this from \\(U(aI + VU) = (aI + UV)U\\), followed by multiplication by \\((aI + UV)^{-1}\\) on the left and the right.

The Laplace distribution has the probability density function: \\[\np(\\beta_j \\mid b) = \\frac{1}{2b}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|\\beta_j|}{b}\\right)\n\\] and is shown in Figure 1.3.\n\n\nCode\n# PLot Laplace distribution\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nb &lt;- 1\nbeta &lt;- seq(-5, 5, length.out = 100)\nlaplace_pdf &lt;- function(beta, b) {\n  (1/(2*b)) * exp(-abs(beta)/b)\n}\nlaplace_data &lt;- data.frame(beta = beta, pdf = laplace_pdf(beta, b))\nggplot(laplace_data, aes(x = beta, y = pdf)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Laplace Distribution PDF\", x = \"Beta\", y = \"Density\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Laplace Distribution PDF\n\n\n\n\n\nThe negative log of this prior distribution is given by: \\[\n-\\log p(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{b} \\|\\beta\\|_1 + \\text{const},\n\\] where \\(\\|\\beta\\|_1 = \\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j|\\) is the \\(\\ell_1\\)-norm of the vector \\(\\beta\\). The regularization term \\(\\phi(f)\\) is then given by: \\[\n\\phi(f) = \\frac{1}{b} \\|\\beta\\|_1.  \n\\] This leads to the following optimization problem: \\[\n\\underset{\\beta}{\\mathrm{minimize}}\\quad \\|y- X\\beta\\|_2^2 + \\lambda \\|\\beta\\|_1,\n\\] where \\(\\lambda = 2\\sigma^2/b\\) is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of the prior. Unlike ridge regression, the Lasso optimization problem does not have a closed-form solution due to the non-differentiable nature of the \\(\\ell_1\\) penalty. However, efficient algorithms such as coordinate descent and proximal gradient methods can be used to solve it.\nThe key distinguishing feature of Lasso is its ability to perform automatic variable selection. The \\(\\ell_1\\) penalty encourages sparsity in the coefficient vector \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\), meaning that many coefficients will be exactly zero. This property makes Lasso particularly useful for high-dimensional problems where feature selection is important.\nWhen \\(\\lambda=0\\), the Lasso reduces to the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate. As \\(\\lambda\\) increases, more coefficients are driven to exactly zero, resulting in a sparser model. When \\(\\lambda\\) is very large, all coefficients become zero.\nThe geometric intuition behind Lasso’s sparsity-inducing property comes from the constraint formulation. We can write the Lasso problem as: \\[\n\\underset{\\beta}{\\mathrm{minimize}}\\quad \\|y- X\\beta\\|_2^2 \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\|\\beta\\|_1 \\leq t,\n\\] where \\(t\\) is a positive constant that controls the sparsity of the solution. The constraint region \\(\\|\\beta\\|_1 \\leq t\\) forms a diamond (in 2D) or rhombus-shaped region with sharp corners at the coordinate axes. The optimal solution often occurs at these corners, where some coefficients are exactly zero.\nFrom a Bayesian perspective, the Lasso estimator corresponds to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate under independent Laplace priors on the coefficients. We use Bayes rule to calculate the posterior as a product of Normal likelihood and Laplace prior: \\[\n\\log p(\\beta \\mid y, b) \\propto -\\|y-X\\beta\\|_2^2 - \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{b}\\|\\beta\\|_1.\n\\] For fixed \\(\\sigma^2\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\), the posterior mode is equivalent to the Lasso estimate with \\(\\lambda = 2\\sigma^2/b\\). Large variance \\(b\\) of the prior is equivalent to small penalty weight \\(\\lambda\\) in the Lasso objective function.\nOne of the most popular algorithms for solving the Lasso problem is coordinate descent. The algorithm iteratively updates each coefficient while holding all others fixed. For the \\(j\\)-th coefficient, the update rule is: \\[\n\\hat{\\beta}_j \\leftarrow \\text{soft}\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{ij}(y_i - \\sum_{k \\neq j} x_{ik}\\hat{\\beta}_k), \\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right),\n\\] where the soft-thresholding operator is defined as: \\[\n\\text{soft}(z, \\gamma) = \\text{sign}(z)(|z| - \\gamma)_+ = \\begin{cases}\nz - \\gamma & \\text{if } z &gt; \\gamma \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } |z| \\leq \\gamma \\\\\nz + \\gamma & \\text{if } z &lt; -\\gamma\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nExample 1.4 (Sparsity and Variable Selection) We will demonstrate the Lasso’s ability to perform variable selection and shrinkage using simulated data. The data will consist of a design matrix with correlated predictors and a sparse signal, where only a 5 out of 20 predictors have non-zero coefficients.\n\n\nCode\n# Generate simulated data\nset.seed(123)\nn &lt;- 100  # number of observations\np &lt;- 20   # number of predictors\nsigma &lt;- 1  # noise level\n\n# Create design matrix with some correlation structure\nX &lt;- matrix(rnorm(n * p), n, p)\n# Add some correlation between predictors\nfor(i in 2:p) {\n  X[, i] &lt;- 0.5 * X[, i-1] + sqrt(0.75) * X[, i]\n}\n\n\n\n# True coefficients - sparse signal\nbeta_true &lt;- c(3, -2, 1.5, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, -1, rep(0, 10))\nsparse_indices &lt;- which(beta_true != 0)\n\n# Generate response\ny &lt;- X %*% beta_true + sigma * rnorm(n)\n\nThen we use glmnet package to fit the Lasso model and visualize the coefficient paths. We will also perform cross-validation to select the optimal regularization parameter \\(\\lambda\\).\n\n# Fit LASSO path using glmnet\nlibrary(glmnet)\nlasso_fit &lt;- glmnet(X, y, alpha = 1)\n\n# Plot coefficient paths\nplot(lasso_fit, xvar = \"lambda\", label = TRUE)\ntitle(\"LASSO Coefficient Paths\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coefficient paths plot shows how LASSO coefficients shrink toward zero as the regularization parameter lambda increases. The colored lines represent different predictors, demonstrating LASSO’s variable selection property. Note, that glmnet fitted the model for a sequence of \\(\\lambda\\) values. The algorithms starts with a large lambda value, where all coefficients are penalized to zero. Then, it gradually decreases lambda, using the coefficients from the previous, slightly more penalized model as a “warm start” for the current calculation. This pathwise approach is significantly more efficient than starting the optimization from scratch for every single \\(\\lambda\\). By default, glmnet computes the coefficients for a sequence of 100 lambda values spaced evenly on the logarithmic scale, starting from a data-driven maximum value (where all coefficients are zero) down to a small fraction of that maximum. The user can specify their own sequence of lambda values if specific granularity or range is desired\nFinally, we will perform cross-validation to select the optimal \\(\\lambda\\) value and compare the estimated coefficients with the true values.\n\n# Cross-validation to select optimal lambda\ncv_lasso &lt;- cv.glmnet(X, y, alpha = 1, nfolds = 10)\n# Plot cross-validation curve\nplot(cv_lasso)\n\n\n\n\nCross-validation for LASSO\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can extract the coefficients lambda.min and lambda.1se from the cross-validation results, which correspond to the minimum cross-validated error and the most regularized model within one standard error of the minimum, respectively.\n\n# Extract coefficients at optimal lambda\nlambda_min &lt;- cv_lasso$lambda.min\nlambda_1se &lt;- cv_lasso$lambda.1se\ncoef_min &lt;- coef(lasso_fit, s = lambda_min)\ncoef_1se &lt;- coef(lasso_fit, s = lambda_1se)\n# Print values of lambda\ncat(\"Optimal lambda (min):\", lambda_min, \"\\n\")\n\n## Optimal lambda (min): 0.016\n\ncat(\"Optimal lambda (1se):\", lambda_1se, \"\\n\")\n\n## Optimal lambda (1se): 0.1\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Compare estimates with true values\ncomparison &lt;- data.frame(\n  True = c(0, beta_true),  # Include intercept\n  LASSO_min = as.vector(coef_min),\n  LASSO_1se = as.vector(coef_1se)\n)\nrownames(comparison) &lt;- c(\"Intercept\", paste0(\"X\", 1:p))\n# Visualization of coefficient estimates\nlibrary(reshape2)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Melt data for plotting\nplot_data &lt;- melt(comparison, id.vars = NULL)\nplot_data$Variable &lt;- rep(rownames(comparison), 3)\nplot_data$Variable &lt;- factor(plot_data$Variable, levels = rownames(comparison))\n\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = Variable, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(y = \"Coefficient Value\", fill = \"Method\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(type = \"qual\", palette = \"Set2\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCoefficient Estimates Comparison\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like LASSO has successfully identified the non-zero coefficients and shrunk the noise variables to zero. The coefficient estimates at lambda.min and lambda.1se show that LASSO retains the true signals while effectively ignoring the noise. Let’s calculate the prediction errors and evaluate the variable selection performance of LASSO at both optimal \\[\\lambda\\] values.\n\n# Calculate prediction errors\npred_min &lt;- predict(lasso_fit, newx = X, s = lambda_min)\npred_1se &lt;- predict(lasso_fit, newx = X, s = lambda_1se)\n\nmse_min &lt;- mean((y - pred_min)^2)\nmse_1se &lt;- mean((y - pred_1se)^2)\n\ncat(\"Mean Squared Error (lambda.min):\", round(mse_min, 3), \"\\n\")\n\n## Mean Squared Error (lambda.min): 0.68\n\ncat(\"Mean Squared Error (lambda.1se):\", round(mse_1se, 3), \"\\n\")\n\n## Mean Squared Error (lambda.1se): 0.85\n\n\nIn summary, this example demonstrates how LASSO regression can be used for both variable selection and regularization in high-dimensional settings. By tuning the regularization parameter \\(\\lambda\\), LASSO is able to shrink irrelevant coefficients to zero, effectively identifying the true underlying predictors while controlling model complexity. The comparison of coefficient estimates and prediction errors at different \\(\\lambda\\) values highlights the trade-off between model sparsity and predictive accuracy. LASSO’s ability to produce interpretable, sparse models makes it a powerful tool in modern statistical learning, especially when dealing with datasets where the number of predictors may be large relative to the number of observations.\n\n\nScale Mixture Representation\nThe Laplace distribution can be represented as a scale mixture of Normal distributions (Andrews and Mallows 1974): \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\beta_j \\mid \\sigma^2,\\tau_j &\\sim N(0,\\tau_j^2\\sigma^2)\\\\\n\\tau_j^2 \\mid \\alpha &\\sim \\text{Exp}(\\alpha^2/2)\\\\\n\\sigma^2 &\\sim \\pi(\\sigma^2).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] We can show equivalence by integrating out \\(\\tau_j\\): \\[\np(\\beta_j\\mid \\sigma^2,\\alpha) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\tau_j\\sigma^2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta_j^2}{2\\sigma^2\\tau_j^2}\\right)\\frac{\\alpha^2}{2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha^2\\tau_j^2}{2}\\right)d\\tau_j = \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\sigma}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha|\\beta_j|}{\\sigma}\\right).\n\\] Thus it is a Laplace distribution with location 0 and scale \\(\\alpha/\\sigma\\). Representation of Laplace prior is a scale Normal mixture allows us to apply an efficient numerical algorithm for computing samples from the posterior distribution. This algorithms is called a Gibbs sample and it iteratively samples from \\(\\theta \\mid a,y\\) and \\(b\\mid \\theta,y\\) to estimate joint distribution over \\((\\hat \\theta, \\hat b)\\). Thus, we so not need to apply cross-validation to find optimal value of \\(b\\), the Bayesian algorithm does it “automatically”.",

    "text": "1.5 Bridge (\\(\\ell_{\\alpha}\\))\nThe bridge estimator represents a powerful generalization that unifies many popular regularization approaches, bridging the gap between subset selection (\\(\\ell_0\\)) and Lasso (\\(\\ell_1\\)) penalties. For the regression model \\(y = X\\beta + \\epsilon\\) with unknown vector \\(\\beta = (\\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_p)'\\), the bridge estimator minimizes:\n\\[\nQ_y(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{2} \\|y - X\\beta\\|^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j|^\\alpha\n\\tag{1.3}\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha \\in (0,2]\\) is the bridge parameter and \\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\) controls the regularization strength. This penalty interpolates between different sparsity-inducing behaviors. As \\(\\alpha \\to 0\\), the penalty approaches best subset selection (\\(\\ell_0\\)); when \\(\\alpha = 1\\), it reduces to the Lasso penalty (\\(\\ell_1\\)); and when \\(\\alpha = 2\\), it becomes the Ridge penalty (\\(\\ell_2\\)). The bridge penalty is non-convex when \\(0 &lt; \\alpha &lt; 1\\), making optimization challenging but providing superior theoretical properties. Specifically, when \\(\\alpha &lt; 1\\), the penalty is concave over \\((0,\\infty)\\), leading to the oracle property under certain regularity conditions—the ability to identify the true sparse structure and estimate non-zero coefficients as efficiently as if the true model were known.\n\nBayesian Framework and Data Augmentation\nFrom a Bayesian perspective, the bridge estimator corresponds to the MAP estimate under an exponential-power prior. The Bayesian bridge model treats \\(p(\\beta \\mid y) \\propto \\exp\\{-Q_y(\\beta)\\}\\) as a posterior distribution, arising from assuming a Gaussian likelihood for \\(y\\) and independent exponential-power priors: \\[\np(\\beta_j \\mid \\alpha, \\tau) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\tau \\Gamma(1 + 1/\\alpha)} \\exp\\left(-\\left|\\frac{\\beta_j}{\\tau}\\right|^\\alpha\\right)\n\\tag{1.4}\\]\nwhere \\(\\tau = \\lambda^{-1/\\alpha}\\) is the scale parameter. The Bayesian framework offers compelling advantages over classical bridge estimation. Rather than providing only a point estimate, it yields the full posterior distribution, enabling uncertainty quantification and credible intervals. The regularization parameter \\(\\lambda\\) can be learned from the data through hyperpriors, avoiding cross-validation. Most importantly, the bridge posterior is often multimodal, especially with correlated predictors, and MCMC naturally explores all modes while optimization may get trapped in local optima.\nPosterior inference for the Bayesian bridge is facilitated by two key data augmentation representations. The first represents the exponential-power prior as a scale mixture of normals using Bernstein’s theorem: \\(\\exp(-|t|^{\\alpha}) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-s t^2/2} g(s) \\, ds\\), where \\(g(s)\\) is the density of a positive \\(\\alpha/2\\)-stable random variable. However, the conditional posterior for the mixing variables becomes an exponentially tilted stable distribution, which lacks a closed form and requires specialized sampling algorithms.\nA novel alternative representation avoids stable distributions by expressing the exponential-power prior as a scale mixture of triangular (Bartlett-Fejer) kernels: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(y \\mid \\beta, \\sigma^2) &\\sim N(X\\beta, \\sigma^2 I) \\\\\np(\\beta_j \\mid \\tau, \\omega_j, \\alpha) &= \\frac{1}{\\tau \\omega_j^{1/\\alpha}} \\left\\{ 1 - \\left| \\frac{\\beta_j}{\\tau \\omega_j^{1/\\alpha}} \\right| \\right\\}_+ \\\\\n(\\omega_j \\mid \\alpha) &\\sim \\frac{1+\\alpha}{2} \\cdot \\text{Gamma}(2+1/\\alpha,1) + \\frac{1-\\alpha}{2} \\cdot \\text{Gamma}(1+1/\\alpha,1)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1.5}\\]\nwhere \\(\\{a\\}_+ = \\max(a,0)\\). This mixture of gamma distributions is much simpler to sample from and naturally captures the bimodality of the bridge posterior through its two-component structure. The choice of representation depends on the design matrix structure: the Bartlett-Fejer representation is 2-3 times more efficient for orthogonal designs, while the scale mixture of normals performs better for collinear designs.\n\n\nTheoretical Properties and Computational Implementation\nThe bridge prior with \\(\\alpha &lt; 1\\) enjoys several desirable theoretical properties. It satisfies the oracle property under regularity conditions, correctly identifying the true sparsity pattern and estimating non-zero coefficients at the same rate as if the true model were known. The exponential-power prior has heavier-than-exponential tails when \\(\\alpha &lt; 1\\), avoiding over-shrinkage of large signals. The marginal likelihood has a redescending score function, highly desirable for sparse estimation as it reduces the influence of small observations while preserving large signals.\nThe Bartlett-Fejer representation leads to an efficient Gibbs sampler that introduces slice variables \\(u_j\\) and iterates through updating slice variables from uniform distributions, sampling mixing variables \\(\\omega_j\\) from truncated gamma mixtures, updating coefficients \\(\\beta\\) from truncated multivariate normal distributions centered at the least-squares estimate, and updating hyperparameters including the global scale \\(\\tau\\) and optionally the bridge parameter \\(\\alpha\\) via Metropolis-Hastings. A crucial feature enabling efficient sampling is the ability to marginalize over local scale parameters when updating the global scale \\(\\tau\\), leading to excellent mixing properties that contrast favorably with other sparse Bayesian methods.\nA distinctive feature of the bridge posterior is its multimodality, particularly pronounced with correlated predictors. Unlike Lasso or ridge regression, which yield unimodal posteriors, the bridge posterior can exhibit multiple modes corresponding to different sparse representations of the same underlying signal. This multimodality reflects genuine model uncertainty and should not be viewed as a computational nuisance. The Bayesian approach properly accounts for this uncertainty by averaging over all modes, leading to more robust inference than selecting a single mode.\n\n\nEmpirical Performance and Practical Application\nExtensive simulation studies demonstrate the superiority of Bayesian bridge estimation across multiple dimensions. On benchmark datasets including Boston housing, ozone concentration, and NIR glucose data, the Bayesian bridge posterior mean consistently outperforms both least squares and classical bridge estimators in out-of-sample prediction, with improvements often exceeding 50% reduction in prediction error. In simulation studies with \\(p = 100\\), \\(n = 101\\), and correlated design matrices, the Bayesian approach dramatically outperforms classical methods. For example, with \\(\\alpha = 0.5\\), the mean squared error in estimating \\(\\beta\\) was 2254 for least squares, 1611 for classical bridge, and only 99 for Bayesian bridge across 250 simulated datasets.\nTo illustrate practical advantages, consider the classic diabetes dataset with 442 observations and 10 predictors. Fitting both classical bridge (using generalized cross-validation) and Bayesian bridge (with Gamma(2,2) prior for \\(\\tau\\) and uniform prior for \\(\\alpha\\)) models reveals several key differences. The Bayesian posterior exhibits pronounced multimodality for coefficients associated with highly correlated predictors, while the classical solution provides only a single point estimate. The classical bridge solution does not coincide with the joint mode of the fully Bayesian posterior due to uncertainty in hyperparameters that is ignored in the classical approach. The posterior distribution for the bridge parameter \\(\\alpha\\) shows strong preference for values around 0.7, significantly different from the Lasso (\\(\\alpha = 1\\)), suggesting the data favors more aggressive sparsity-inducing behavior.\n\nExample 1.5 (Practical Implementation with BayesBridge Package) We demonstrate the Bayesian Bridge using the diabetes dataset, comparing it with Lasso and Ridge regression.

This suggests that the data favors a more aggressive approach to inducing sparsity. The process of learning this parameter from the data removes the need for manual tuning or extensive cross-validation.\nThe Bridge method displays a unique pattern of shrinkage. It applies less shrinkage to large coefficients while shrinking small coefficients more aggressively. This behavior can be seen in the comparison of shrinkage, where the ratio of Bridge to Lasso is higher for variables with larger Lasso coefficients. This illustrates the so-called oracle property.\nIn contrast to classical approaches, the Bayesian Bridge provides credible intervals for all parameters. For example, variables such as ‘bmi’, ‘bp’, and ‘s5’ have credible intervals that do not include zero, which indicates strong evidence for their importance. Other variables have intervals that contain zero, reflecting uncertainty about their relevance.\nThe diabetes dataset includes several correlated predictors, as revealed by the correlation analysis. The Bridge method performs better in this context, which aligns with its theoretical advantage over the Lasso when handling groups of correlated variables. Rather than arbitrarily selecting a single variable from a group, the Bridge tends to include all relevant variables.\nThe simulated results indicate about a 15% improvement in predictive mean squared error compared to the Lasso. This finding is consistent with empirical studies on datasets with similar correlation structures. The improvement is due to the Bridge’s ability to balance variable selection with appropriate shrinkage.\nAlthough not fully illustrated in this simplified example, the posterior distribution under the Bridge model often shows multimodality when predictors are correlated. This feature provides valuable information about model uncertainty that is not captured by classical point estimates.\nThese results illustrate why the Bayesian Bridge has gained attention in modern statistical learning: it combines the theoretical elegance of achieving oracle properties with practical advantages in uncertainty quantification and automatic parameter tuning, making it particularly valuable for high-dimensional problems with complex correlation structures.\n\nBased on theoretical analysis and empirical studies, several practical guidelines emerge. For most applications, \\(\\alpha \\in [0.5, 0.8]\\) provides good balance between sparsity and estimation accuracy, though placing a uniform prior on \\(\\alpha\\) and learning from data is recommended when uncertain. A Gamma(2,2) prior for the global scale parameter \\(\\tau\\) works well in practice, providing reasonable regularization without being overly informative. The Bartlett-Fejer representation should be used for orthogonal or nearly orthogonal designs, while the scale mixture of normals is better for highly collinear predictors. Practitioners should examine posterior distributions for multimodality, especially with correlated predictors, as this provides valuable insight into model uncertainty that point estimates miss entirely.\nThe bridge framework extends naturally to other likelihoods including logistic regression and quantile regression, where similar data augmentation strategies apply. Both approaches are implemented in the R package BayesBridge, which automatically selects the most efficient algorithm based on design matrix properties. The bridge penalty occupies a unique position in the regularization landscape, providing less bias than Lasso for large coefficients while maintaining sparsity, achieving variable selection unlike ridge regression, and offering computational advantages over spike-and-slab priors while still providing heavy-tailed, sparsity-inducing behavior. The Bayesian bridge thus represents a mature, computationally efficient approach to sparse regression that provides superior performance while naturally quantifying uncertainty, making it an excellent choice for modern high-dimensional inference problems.",

    "text": "1.6 Full Bayes for Sparsity Shrinkage\nThus far we have considered the problem of finding the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the parameters by minimizing the negative log posterior. The resulting penalized objective function is given by provies a way to control the amount of regularisation \\(\\lambda\\) that gauges the trade-off between the compromise between the observed data and the initial prior beliefs.\nThe alternative approach to the regularisation is to use full Bayes, which places a prior distribution on the parameters and computes the full posterior distribution using the Bayes rule: \\[\np( \\theta | y ) = \\frac{ f( y | \\theta ) p( \\theta) }{m(y)},\n\\] here \\[\nm(y) = \\int f( y\\mid  \\theta ) p( \\theta ) d \\theta\n\\] Here \\(m(y)\\) is the marginal beliefs about the data.\n\nSpike-and-Slab Prior\nOur Bayesian formulation of allows to specify a wide range of range of regularized formulations for a regression problem. In this section we consider a Bayesian model for variable selection. Consider a linear regression problem \\[\ny = \\beta_1x_1+\\ldots+\\beta_px_p + e \\ , \\ \\  \\text{where } e \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2),~-\\infty \\le \\beta_i \\le \\infty \\ .\n\\] We would like to solve the problem of variable selections, i.e. identify which input variables \\(x_i\\) to be used in our model. The gold standard for Bayesian variable selection are spike-and-slab priors, or Bernoulli-Gaussian mixtures. Whilst spike-and-slab priors provide full model uncertainty quantification, they can be hard to scale to very high dimensional problems and can have poor sparsity properties. On the other hand, techniques like proximal algorithms can solve non-convex optimization problems which are fast and scalable, although they generally don’t provide a full assessment of model uncertainty.\nTo perform a model selection, we would like to specify a prior distribution \\(p\\left(\\beta\\right)\\), which imposes a sparsity assumption on \\(\\beta\\), where only a small portion of all \\(\\beta_i\\)’s are non-zero. In other words, \\(\\|\\beta\\|_0 = k \\ll p\\), where \\(\\|\\beta\\|_0 \\defeq \\#\\{i : \\beta_i\\neq0\\}\\), the cardinality of the support of \\(\\beta\\), also known as the \\(\\ell_0\\) (pseudo)norm of \\(\\beta\\). A multivariate Gaussian prior (\\(l_2\\) norm) leads to poor sparsity properties in this situation. Sparsity-inducing prior distributions for \\(\\beta\\) can be constructed to impose sparsity include the double exponential (lasso).\nUnder spike-and-slab, each \\(\\beta_i\\) exchangeably follows a mixture prior consisting of \\(\\delta_0\\), a point mass at \\(0\\), and a Gaussian distribution centered at zero. Hence we write,\n\\[\n\\label{eqn:ss}\n\\beta_i | \\theta, \\sigma_\\beta^2 \\sim (1-\\theta)\\delta_0 + \\theta N\\left(0, \\sigma_\\beta^2\\right) \\ .\n\\] Here \\(\\theta\\in \\left(0, 1\\right)\\) controls the overall sparsity in \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\sigma_\\beta^2\\) accommodates non-zero signals. This family is termed as the Bernoulli-Gaussian mixture model in the signal processing community.\nA useful re-parameterization, the parameters \\(\\beta\\) is given by two independent random variable vectors \\(\\gamma = \\left(\\gamma_1, \\ldots, \\gamma_p\\right)'\\) and \\(\\alpha = \\left(\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_p\\right)'\\) such that \\(\\beta_i  =  \\gamma_i\\alpha_i\\), with probabilistic structure \\[\n\\label{eq:bg}\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\gamma_i\\mid\\theta & \\sim & \\text{Bernoulli}(\\theta) \\ ;\n\\\\\n\\alpha_i \\mid \\sigma_\\beta^2 &\\sim & N\\left(0, \\sigma_\\beta^2\\right) \\ .\n\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\] Since \\(\\gamma_i\\) and \\(\\alpha_i\\) are independent, the joint prior density becomes \\[\np\\left(\\gamma_i, \\alpha_i \\mid \\theta, \\sigma_\\beta^2\\right) =\n\\theta^{\\gamma_i}\\left(1-\\theta\\right)^{1-\\gamma_i}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_\\beta}\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{\\alpha_i^2}{2\\sigma_\\beta^2}\\right\\}\n\\ , \\ \\ \\ \\text{for } 1\\leq i\\leq p \\ .\n\\] The indicator \\(\\gamma_i\\in \\{0, 1\\}\\) can be viewed as a dummy variable to indicate whether \\(\\beta_i\\) is included in the model.\nLet \\(S = \\{i: \\gamma_i = 1\\} \\subseteq \\{1, \\ldots, p\\}\\) be the “active set\" of \\(\\gamma\\), and \\(\\|\\gamma\\|_0 = \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^p\\gamma_i\\) be its cardinality. The joint prior on the vector \\(\\{\\gamma, \\alpha\\}\\) then factorizes as \\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\np\\left(\\gamma, \\alpha \\mid \\theta, \\sigma_\\beta^2\\right) & = & \\prod\\limits_{i = 1}^p p\\left(\\alpha_i, \\gamma_i \\mid \\theta, \\sigma_\\beta^2\\right) \\\\\n& = &\n\\theta^{\\|\\gamma\\|_0}\n\\left(1-\\theta\\right)^{p - \\|\\gamma\\|_0}\n\\left(2\\pi\\sigma_\\beta^2\\right)^{-\\frac p2}\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac1{2\\sigma_\\beta^2}\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^p\\alpha_i^2\\right\\} \\ .\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nLet \\(X_\\gamma \\defeq \\left[X_i\\right]_{i \\in S}\\) be the set of “active explanatory variables\" and \\(\\alpha_\\gamma \\defeq \\left(\\alpha_i\\right)'_{i \\in S}\\) be their corresponding coefficients. We can write \\(X\\beta = X_\\gamma \\alpha_\\gamma\\). The likelihood can be expressed in terms of \\(\\gamma\\), \\(\\alpha\\) as \\[\np\\left(y \\mid \\gamma, \\alpha, \\theta, \\sigma_e^2\\right)\n=\n\\left(2\\pi\\sigma_e^2\\right)^{-\\frac n2}\n\\exp\\left\\{\n-\\frac1{2\\sigma_e^2}\\left\\|y - X_\\gamma \\alpha_\\gamma\\right\\|_2^2\n\\right\\} \\ .\n\\]\nUnder this re-parameterization by \\(\\left\\{\\gamma, \\alpha\\right\\}\\), the posterior is given by\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\np\\left(\\gamma, \\alpha \\mid \\theta, \\sigma_\\beta^2, \\sigma_e^2, y\\right) & \\propto &\np\\left(\\gamma, \\alpha \\mid \\theta, \\sigma_\\beta^2\\right)\np\\left(y \\mid \\gamma, \\alpha, \\theta, \\sigma_e^2\\right)\\\\\n& \\propto &\n\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac1{2\\sigma_e^2}\\left\\|y - X_\\gamma \\alpha_\\gamma\\right\\|_2^2\n-\\frac1{2\\sigma_\\beta^2}\\left\\|\\alpha\\right\\|_2^2\n-\\log\\left(\\frac{1-\\theta}{\\theta}\\right)\n\\left\\|\\gamma\\right\\|_0\n\\right\\} \\ .\n\\end{array}\n\\] Our goal then is to find the regularized maximum a posterior (MAP) estimator \\[\n\\arg\\max\\limits_{\\gamma, \\alpha}p\\left(\\gamma, \\alpha \\mid \\theta, \\sigma_\\beta^2, \\sigma_e^2, y \\right) \\ .\n\\] By construction, the \\(\\gamma\\) \\(\\in\\left\\{0, 1\\right\\}^p\\) will directly perform variable selection. Spike-and-slab priors, on the other hand, will sample the full posterior and calculate the posterior probability of variable inclusion. Finding the MAP estimator is equivalent to minimizing over \\(\\left\\{\\gamma, \\alpha\\right\\}\\) the regularized least squares objective function\n\\[\n\\min\\limits_{\\gamma, \\alpha}\\left\\|y - X_\\gamma \\alpha_\\gamma\\right\\|_2^2\n+ \\frac{\\sigma_e^2}{\\sigma_\\beta^2}\\left\\|\\alpha\\right\\|_2^2\n+ 2\\sigma_e^2\\log\\left(\\frac{1-\\theta}{\\theta}\\right)\n\\left\\|\\gamma\\right\\|_0 \\ .\n\\tag{1.6}\\] This objective possesses several interesting properties:\n\nThe first term is essentially the least squares loss function.\nThe second term looks like a ridge regression penalty and has connection with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) \\(\\sigma_\\beta^2/\\sigma_e^2\\). Smaller SNR will be more likely to shrink the estimates towards \\(0\\). If \\(\\sigma_\\beta^2 \\gg \\sigma_e^2\\), the prior uncertainty on the size of non-zero coefficients is much larger than the noise level, that is, the SNR is sufficiently large, this term can be ignored. This is a common assumption in spike-and-slab framework in that people usually want \\(\\sigma_\\beta \\to \\infty\\) or to be “sufficiently large\" in order to avoid imposing harsh shrinkage to non-zero signals.\nIf we further assume that \\(\\theta &lt; \\frac12\\), meaning that the coefficients are known to be sparse a priori, then \\(\\log\\left(\\left(1-\\theta\\right) / \\theta\\right) &gt; 0\\), and the third term can be seen as an \\(\\ell_0\\) regularization.\n\nTherefore, our Bayesian objective inference is connected to \\(\\ell_0\\)-regularized least squares, which we summarize in the following proposition.\n(Spike-and-slab MAP & \\(\\ell_0\\) regularization)\nFor some \\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\), assuming \\(\\theta &lt; \\frac12\\), \\(\\sigma_\\beta^2 \\gg \\sigma_e^2\\), the Bayesian MAP estimate defined by Equation 1.6 is equivalent to the \\(\\ell_0\\) regularized least squares objective, for some \\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\), \\[\n\\min\\limits_{\\beta}\n\\frac12\\left\\|y - X\\beta\\right\\|_2^2\n+ \\lambda\n\\left\\|\\beta\\right\\|_0 \\ .\n\\tag{1.7}\\]\nFirst, assuming that \\[\n\\theta &lt; \\frac12, \\ \\ \\  \\sigma_\\beta^2 \\gg \\sigma_e^2, \\ \\ \\  \\frac{\\sigma_e^2}{\\sigma_\\beta^2}\\left\\|\\alpha\\right\\|_2^2 \\to 0 \\ ,\n\\] gives us an objective function of the form \\[\n\\min\\limits_{\\gamma, \\alpha}\n\\frac12 \\left\\|y - X_\\gamma \\alpha_\\gamma\\right\\|_2^2\n+ \\lambda\n\\left\\|\\gamma\\right\\|_0,  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\text{where } \\lambda \\defeq \\sigma_e^2\\log\\left(\\left(1-\\theta\\right) / \\theta\\right) &gt; 0 \\ .\n\\tag{1.8}\\]\nEquation Equation 1.8 can be seen as a variable selection version of equation Equation 1.7. The interesting fact is that Equation 1.7 and Equation 1.8 are equivalent. To show this, we need only to check that the optimal solution to Equation 1.7 corresponds to a feasible solution to Equation 1.8 and vice versa. This is explained as follows.\nOn the one hand, assuming \\(\\hat\\beta\\) is an optimal solution to Equation 1.7, then we can correspondingly define \\(\\hat\\gamma_i \\defeq I\\left\\{\\hat\\beta_i \\neq 0\\right\\}\\), \\(\\hat\\alpha_i \\defeq \\hat\\beta_i\\), such that \\(\\left\\{\\hat\\gamma, \\hat\\alpha\\right\\}\\) is feasible to Equation 1.8 and gives the same objective value as \\(\\hat\\beta\\) gives Equation 1.7.\nOn the other hand, assuming \\(\\left\\{\\hat\\gamma, \\hat\\alpha\\right\\}\\) is optimal to Equation 1.8, implies that we must have all of the elements in \\(\\hat\\alpha_\\gamma\\) should be non-zero, otherwise a new \\(\\tilde\\gamma_i \\defeq I\\left\\{\\hat\\alpha_i \\neq 0\\right\\}\\) will give a lower objective value of Equation 1.8. As a result, if we define \\(\\hat\\beta_i \\defeq \\hat\\gamma_i\\hat\\alpha_i\\), \\(\\hat\\beta\\) will be feasible to Equation 1.7 and gives the same objective value as \\(\\left\\{\\hat\\gamma, \\hat\\alpha\\right\\}\\) gives Equation 1.8.\n\n\nHorseshoe Prior\nThe horseshoe priors introduced earlier are the Bayesian counterpart of \\(\\ell_1\\) regularization (lasso). Horseshoe is particularly designed to revcover a few large signals among many (nearly zero) noisy observations. The goal is to find a niddle in the haystack.\nThe sparse normal means problem is concerned with inference for the parameter vector \\(\\theta = ( \\theta_1 , \\ldots , \\theta_p )\\) where we observe data \\(y_i = \\theta_i + \\epsilon_i\\) where the level of sparsity might be unknown. From both a theoretical and empirical viewpoint, regularized estimators have won the day. This still leaves open the question of how does specify a penalty, denoted by \\(\\pi_{HS}\\), (a.k.a. log-prior, \\(- \\log p_{HS}\\))? Lasso simply uses an \\(L^1\\)-norm, \\(\\sum_{i=1}^K | \\theta_i |\\), as opposed to the horseshoe prior which (essentially) uses the penalty \\[\n\\pi_{HS} ( \\theta_i | \\tau ) = - \\log p_{HS} ( \\theta_i | \\tau ) = - \\log \\log \\left ( 1 + \\frac{2 \\tau^2}{\\theta_i^2} \\right ) .\n\\] The motivation for the horseshoe penalty arises from the analysis of the prior mass and influence on the posterior in both the tail and behaviour at the origin. The latter is the key determinate of the sparsity properties of the estimator.\nThe horseshoe Carvalho, Polson, and Scott (2010) is a Bayesian method for ‘needle-in-a-haystack’ type problems where there is some sparsity, meaning that there are some signals amid mostly noise.\nWe introduce the horseshoe in the context of the normal means model, which is given by \\[Y_i = \\beta_i + \\varepsilon_i, \\quad i = 1, \\ldots, n,\\] with \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) i.i.d. \\(\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)\\). The horseshoe prior is given by \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\beta_i &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2 \\tau^2 \\lambda_i^2)\\\\\n\\lambda_i &\\sim C^+(0, 1),\n\\end{align*}\\] where \\(C^+\\) denotes the half-Cauchy distribution. Optionally, hyperpriors on \\(\\tau\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) may be specified, as is described further in the next two sections.\nTo illustrate the shrinkage behaviour of the horseshoe, let’s plot the posterior mean for \\(\\beta_i\\) as a function of \\(y_i\\) for three different values of \\(\\tau\\).\n\nlibrary(horseshoe)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ntau.values &lt;- c(0.005, 0.05, 0.5)\ny.values &lt;- seq(-5, 5, length = 100)\ndf &lt;- data.frame(tau = rep(tau.values, each = length(y.values)),\n                 y = rep(y.values, 3),\n                 post.mean = c(HS.post.mean(y.values, tau = tau.values[1], Sigma2=1), \n                               HS.post.mean(y.values, tau = tau.values[2], Sigma2=1), \n                               HS.post.mean(y.values, tau = tau.values[3], Sigma2=1)) )\n\nggplot(data = df, aes(x = y, y = post.mean, group = tau, color = factor(tau))) + \n  geom_line(size = 1.5) + \n  scale_color_brewer(palette=\"Dark2\") + \n  geom_abline(lty = 2) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = \"grey\") + \n  theme_classic() + ylab(\"\") + labs(color = \"Tau\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Horseshoe posterior mean for three values of tau\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmaller values of \\(\\tau\\) lead to stronger shrinkage behaviour of the horseshoe. Observations that are in absolute value at most equal to \\(\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2\\log(1/\\tau)}\\) are shrunk to values close to zero (Van der Pas et al (2014)). For larger observed values, the horseshoe posterior mean will tend to the identity (that is, barely any shrinkage, the estimate will be very close to the observed value). The optimal value of \\(\\tau\\) is the proportion of true signals. This value is typically not known in practice but can be estimated, as described further in the next sections.\n\nThe normal means problem\nThe normal means model is: \\[Y_i = \\beta_i + \\varepsilon_i, \\quad i = 1, \\ldots, n,\\] with \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) i.i.d. \\(\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)\\).\nFirst, we will be computing the posterior mean only, with known variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) The function HS.post.mean computes the posterior mean of \\((\\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_n)\\). It does not require MCMC and is suitable when only an estimate of the vector \\((\\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_n)\\) is desired. In case uncertainty quantification or variable selection is also of interest, or no good value for \\(\\sigma^2\\) is available, please see below for the function HS.normal.means.\nThe function HS.post.mean requires the observed outcomes, a value for \\(\\tau\\) and a value for \\(\\sigma\\). Ideally, \\(\\tau\\) should be equal to the proportion of nonzero \\(\\beta_i\\)’s. Typically, this proportion is unknown, in which case it is recommended to use the function HS.MMLE to find the marginal maximum likelihood estimator for \\(\\tau\\).\nAs an example, we generate 50 data points, the first 10 of which are coming from true signals. The first 10 \\(\\beta_i\\)’s are equal to five and the remaining \\(\\beta_i\\)’s are equal to zero. Let’s first plot the true parameters (black) and observations (blue).\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(index = 1:50,\n                 truth &lt;- c(rep(5, 10), rep(0, 40)),\n                 y &lt;- truth + rnorm(50) #observations\n                 )\n\nggplot(data = df, aes(x = index, y = truth)) + \n  geom_point(size = 2) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = index, y = y), size = 2, col = \"blue\") +\n  theme_classic() + ylab(\"\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Black = truth, Blue = observations\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe estimate \\(\\tau\\) using the MMLE, using the known variance.\n\n(tau.est &lt;- HS.MMLE(df$y, Sigma2 = 1))\n\n## [1] 0.95\n\n\nWe then use this estimate of \\(\\tau\\) to find the posterior mean, and add it to the plot in red.\n\npost.mean &lt;- HS.post.mean(df$y, tau.est, 1)\ndf$post.mean &lt;- post.mean\n\nggplot(data = df, aes(x = index, y = truth)) + \n  geom_point(size = 2) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = index, y = y), size = 2, col = \"blue\") +\n  theme_classic() + ylab(\"\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x = index, y = post.mean), size = 2, col = \"red\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Black = truth, Blue = observations, Red = estimates\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the posterior variance is of interest, the function HS.post.var can be used. It takes the same arguments as HS.post.mean.\n\n\nPosterior mean, credible intervals and variable selection, possibly unknown \\(\\sigma^2\\)\nThe function HS.normal.means is the main function to use for the normal means problem. It uses MCMC and results in an object that contains all MCMC samples as well as the posterior mean for all parameters (\\(\\beta_i\\)’s, \\(\\tau\\), \\(\\sigma\\)), the posterior median for the \\(\\beta_i\\)’s, and credible intervals for the \\(\\beta_i\\)’s.\nThe key choices to make are:\n\nHow to handle \\(\\tau\\). The recommended option is “truncatedCauchy” (a half-Cauchy prior truncated to \\([1/n, 1]\\)). See the manual for other options.\nHow to handle \\(\\sigma\\). The recommended option is “Jeffreys” (Jeffrey’s prior). See the manual for other options.\n\nOther options that can be set by the user are the level of the credible intervals (default is 95%), and the number of MCMC samples (default is 1000 burn-in samples and then 5000 more).\nLet’s continue the example from the previous section. We first create a ‘horseshoe object’.\n\nhs.object &lt;- HS.normal.means(df$y, method.tau = \"truncatedCauchy\", method.sigma = \"Jeffreys\")\n\nWe extract the posterior mean of the \\(\\beta_i\\)’s and plot them in red.\n\ndf$post.mean.full &lt;- hs.object$BetaHat\n\nggplot(data = df, aes(x = index, y = truth)) + \n  geom_point(size = 2) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = index, y = y), size = 2, col = \"blue\") +\n  theme_classic() + ylab(\"\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x = index, y = post.mean.full), size = 2, col = \"red\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Black = truth, Blue = observations, Red = estimates\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe plot the marginal credible intervals (and remove the observations from the plot for clarity).\n\ndf$lower.CI &lt;- hs.object$LeftCI\ndf$upper.CI &lt;- hs.object$RightCI\n\nggplot(data = df, aes(x = index, y = truth)) + \n  geom_point(size = 2) + \n  theme_classic() + ylab(\"\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x = index, y = post.mean.full), size = 2, col = \"red\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower.CI, ymax = upper.CI), width = .1, col = \"red\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Black = truth, Red = estimates with 95% credible intervals\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we perform variable selection using HS.var.select. In the normal means problem, we can use two decision rules. We will illustrate them both. The first method checks whether zero is contained in the credible interval, as studied by Van der Pas et al (2017).\n\ndf$selected.CI &lt;- HS.var.select(hs.object, df$y, method = \"intervals\")\n\nThe result is a vector of zeroes and ones, with the ones indicating that the observations is suspected to correspond to an actual signal. We now plot the results, coloring the estimates/intervals blue if a signal is detected and red otherwise.\n\nggplot(data = df, aes(x = index, y = truth)) + \n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  theme_classic() + ylab(\"\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x = index, y = post.mean.full, col = factor(selected.CI)), \n             size = 2) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower.CI, ymax = upper.CI, col = factor(selected.CI)),\n                width = .1) +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Black = truth, Blue = selected as signal, Red = selected as noise\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other variable selection method is the thresholding method of Carvalho et al (2010). The posterior mean can be written as \\(c_iy_i\\) where \\(y_i\\) is the observation and \\(c_i\\) some number between 0 and 1. A variable is selected if \\(c_i \\geq c\\) for some user-selected threshold \\(c\\) (default is \\(c = 0.5\\)). In the example:\n\ndf$selected.thres &lt;- HS.var.select(hs.object, df$y, method = \"threshold\")\n\n\nggplot(data = df, aes(x = index, y = truth)) + \n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  theme_classic() + ylab(\"\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x = index, y = post.mean.full, col = factor(selected.thres)), \n             size = 2) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower.CI, ymax = upper.CI, col = factor(selected.thres)),\n                width = .1) +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Black = truth, Blue = selected as signal, Red = selected as noise\")",

    "text": "1.7 Subset Selection (\\(\\ell_0\\) Norm)\nThe \\(\\ell_0\\) norm directly counts the number of non-zero parameters, making it the most natural penalty for variable selection. However, \\(\\ell_0\\)-regularized optimization problems are NP-hard due to their combinatorial nature. The optimization problem is:\n\\[\n\\min_{\\beta} \\frac{1}{2}\\|y - X\\beta\\|_2^2 + \\lambda \\|\\beta\\|_0\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\|\\beta\\|_0 = \\#\\{j : \\beta_j \\neq 0\\}\\) is the number of non-zero coefficients. This directly penalizes model complexity by limiting the number of active predictors.\n\nConnection to Spike-and-Slab Priors\nA remarkable connection exists between Bayesian spike-and-slab priors and \\(\\ell_0\\) regularization. Consider the spike-and-slab prior where each coefficient follows:\n\\[\n\\beta_j \\mid \\theta, \\sigma_\\beta^2 \\sim (1-\\theta)\\delta_0 + \\theta N(0, \\sigma_\\beta^2)\n\\]\nHere \\(\\theta \\in (0,1)\\) controls the sparsity level and \\(\\sigma_\\beta^2\\) governs the size of non-zero coefficients. This can be reparametrized using indicator variables \\(\\gamma_j \\in \\{0,1\\}\\) and continuous coefficients \\(\\alpha_j\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\beta_j &= \\gamma_j \\alpha_j \\\\\n\\gamma_j \\mid \\theta &\\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(\\theta) \\\\\n\\alpha_j \\mid \\sigma_\\beta^2 &\\sim N(0, \\sigma_\\beta^2)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator under this prior yields the objective:\n\\[\n\\min_{\\gamma, \\alpha} \\|y - X_\\gamma \\alpha_\\gamma\\|_2^2 + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sigma_\\beta^2}\\|\\alpha\\|_2^2 + 2\\sigma^2\\log\\left(\\frac{1-\\theta}{\\theta}\\right)\\|\\gamma\\|_0\n\\]\nwhere \\(X_\\gamma\\) contains only the columns corresponding to \\(\\gamma_j = 1\\). Under the assumptions \\(\\theta &lt; 1/2\\) (favoring sparsity) and \\(\\sigma_\\beta^2 \\gg \\sigma^2\\) (weak shrinkage on non-zero coefficients), this reduces to the \\(\\ell_0\\)-regularized least squares with \\(\\lambda = 2\\sigma^2\\log\\left(\\frac{1-\\theta}{\\theta}\\right)\\).\n\n\nSingle Best Replacement (SBR) Algorithm\nSince exact \\(\\ell_0\\) optimization is intractable, practical algorithms focus on finding good local optima. The Single Best Replacement (SBR) algorithm addresses the fundamental challenge in sparse regression: finding the optimal subset of predictors when the search space is exponentially large. For \\(p\\) predictors, there are \\(2^p\\) possible subsets to consider, making exhaustive search computationally prohibitive for even moderate \\(p\\).\n\n\nMotivation and Problem Reformulation\nRather than searching over all possible coefficient vectors \\(\\beta\\), SBR reformulates the \\(\\ell_0\\)-regularized problem as a discrete optimization over active sets \\(S \\subseteq \\{1,2,\\ldots,p\\}\\):\n\\[\n\\min_{S} f(S) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|y - X_S \\hat{\\beta}_S\\|_2^2 + \\lambda |S|\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\beta}_S = (X_S^T X_S)^{-1} X_S^T y\\) is the least squares solution on the active set \\(S\\). This reformulation creates a natural bias-variance tradeoff where larger models with bigger active sets reduce bias but increase the penalty, while smaller models reduce the penalty but may increase bias.\n\n\nDetailed Algorithm Description\nThe SBR algorithm operates through a systematic iterative process. The initialization phase begins with an empty active set \\(S_0 = \\emptyset\\), computes the initial objective \\(f(S_0) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|y\\|_2^2\\) (corresponding to no predictors), and sets the iteration counter \\(k = 0\\).\nThe main iteration loop proceeds as follows for each iteration \\(k\\). During candidate generation, the algorithm considers each variable \\(j \\in \\{1,\\ldots,p\\}\\) and defines the single replacement operation: \\[S_k \\cdot j = \\begin{cases}\nS_k \\cup \\{j\\} & \\text{if } j \\notin S_k \\text{ (addition)} \\\\\nS_k \\setminus \\{j\\} & \\text{if } j \\in S_k \\text{ (removal)}\n\\end{cases}\\]\nFor objective evaluation, each candidate \\(S_k \\cdot j\\) is assessed by computing: \\[f(S_k \\cdot j) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|y - X_{S_k \\cdot j} \\hat{\\beta}_{S_k \\cdot j}\\|_2^2 + \\lambda |S_k \\cdot j|\\]\nThe best replacement selection identifies: \\[j^* = \\arg\\min_{j \\in \\{1,\\ldots,p\\}} f(S_k \\cdot j)\\]\nFinally, the improvement check determines whether to accept the move: if \\(f(S_k \\cdot j^*) &lt; f(S_k)\\), the algorithm accepts the move and sets \\(S_{k+1} = S_k \\cdot j^*\\); otherwise, it stops and returns \\(S_k\\) as the final solution.\n\n\nForward-Backward Stepwise Nature\nUnlike pure forward selection which only adds variables or backward elimination which only removes variables, SBR can both add and remove variables at each step. This bidirectionality provides substantial advantages. The algorithm can escape local optima by correcting early mistakes through the removal of previously selected variables. When variables are correlated, the algorithm can swap between equivalent predictors to find better solutions. Additionally, the adaptive model size capability allows the algorithm to both grow and shrink the model as needed during the optimization process.\nWhen compared with standard stepwise methods, the advantages become clear. Forward selection uses greedy addition only and can become trapped if early selections are poor. Backward elimination starts with the full model, making it computationally expensive for large \\(p\\). Traditional forward-backward approaches use separate forward and backward phases, while SBR provides a unified framework that considers both additions and removals at each step.\n\n\nComputational Efficiency Techniques\nThe key computational challenge lies in evaluating \\(f(S \\cdot j)\\) for all \\(p\\) variables at each iteration, as naive implementation would require \\(p\\) separate least squares computations per iteration. Efficient matrix updates provide the solution to this challenge.\nFor the addition case where \\(j \\notin S\\), adding variable \\(j\\) to active set \\(S\\) employs rank-one updates to the Cholesky decomposition. If \\(X_S^T X_S = L_S L_S^T\\), then updating for \\(X_{S \\cup \\{j\\}}^T X_{S \\cup \\{j\\}}\\) requires only \\(O(|S|^2)\\) operations instead of \\(O(|S|^3)\\). Similarly, for the removal case where \\(j \\in S\\), removing variable \\(j\\) from active set \\(S\\) uses rank-one downdates to the Cholesky decomposition with similar \\(O(|S|^2)\\) complexity.\nThe overall computational complexity analysis reveals that each iteration requires \\(O(p|S|^2)\\) operations where \\(|S|\\) is the current active set size, the total number of iterations is typically \\(O(|S_{final}|)\\) in practice, and the overall complexity becomes \\(O(p|S|^3)\\), which is much more efficient than exhaustive search requiring \\(O(2^p)\\) operations.\n\n\nTheoretical Properties\nThe convergence properties of SBR are well-established. The algorithm demonstrates finite convergence, provably converging in finite steps since there are only finitely many possible active sets. It exhibits monotonic improvement where the objective function decreases or stays the same at each iteration. Finally, the algorithm achieves local optimality, with the final solution satisfying local optimality conditions.\nSBR can be viewed as a coordinate-wise proximal gradient method, establishing a connection to proximal gradient methods. The proximal operator for the \\(\\ell_0\\) norm is: \\[\\text{prox}_{\\lambda\\|\\cdot\\|_0}(z) = z \\odot \\mathbf{1}_{|z|&gt;\\sqrt{2\\lambda}}\\]\nThis hard thresholding operation is exactly what SBR implements in a coordinate-wise manner.\nUnder certain regularity conditions, SBR can achieve statistical consistency across multiple dimensions. It demonstrates variable selection consistency by correctly identifying the true active set with high probability. The algorithm provides estimation consistency through consistent estimates of the non-zero coefficients. Additionally, it achieves prediction consistency by attaining optimal prediction error rates.\n\n\nPractical Implementation Considerations\nSeveral practical considerations affect SBR implementation. For regularization parameter selection, cross-validation provides the standard approach but is computationally expensive, while information criteria such as BIC and AIC can provide faster alternatives. Stability selection offers another approach by running SBR on bootstrap samples and selecting stable variables.\nInitialization strategies vary in their effectiveness. The empty start approach using \\(S_0 = \\emptyset\\) is most common, while forward start begins with forward selection for a few steps. Random start employs multiple random initializations for better global search capabilities.\nHandling numerical issues requires attention to several factors. Multicollinearity concerns necessitate checking condition numbers of \\(X_S^T X_S\\). Rank deficiency situations require handling cases where \\(X_S\\) is rank deficient. Numerical stability can be improved by using QR decomposition instead of normal equations when needed.\n\n\nStatistical Properties and Performance\nEmpirical studies demonstrate that SBR achieves statistical performance comparable to the gold-standard spike-and-slab priors while being orders of magnitude faster. The algorithm shows superior variable selection performance compared to Lasso and elastic net in high-correlation settings, achieves lower mean squared error than convex relaxation methods for estimation accuracy, and provides better recovery of the true sparse structure compared to \\(\\ell_1\\) penalties for sparsity detection.\nThe connection between spike-and-slab priors and \\(\\ell_0\\) regularization provides theoretical justification for why SBR performs well: it approximates the MAP estimator of a principled Bayesian model while remaining computationally tractable.\n\n\nAdvantages and Limitations\nSBR offers several computational and theoretical advantages. The algorithm provides computational efficiency, running much faster than full Bayesian methods. It maintains a theoretical foundation through its principled connection to spike-and-slab priors. The approach demonstrates flexibility in handling various problem sizes and correlation structures. Finally, it produces sparse, interpretable models that enhance model interpretability.\nHowever, SBR also has certain limitations. The algorithm provides no guarantee of global optimality, potentially stopping at local optima. Its greedy nature may lead to suboptimal early decisions that affect the final solution. Performance sensitivity depends heavily on \\(\\lambda\\) selection, requiring careful parameter tuning. Additionally, the algorithm may struggle with highly correlated predictors in certain scenarios.\n\n\nExtensions and Variations\nSeveral extensions expand SBR’s applicability. Grouped SBR extends to group selection by replacing single variables with groups: \\[S \\cdot G = \\begin{cases}\nS \\cup G & \\text{if } G \\cap S = \\emptyset \\\\\nS \\setminus G & \\text{if } G \\subseteq S\n\\end{cases}\\]\nRegularization path computation involves computing solutions for a sequence of \\(\\lambda\\) values while using warm starts from previous solutions. Multiple best replacements consider the \\(k\\) best replacements at each step for more thorough search rather than restricting to single best replacement.\n\n\nProximal Perspective\nThe SBR algorithm can be deeply understood through the lens of proximal operators, which provides a unifying framework connecting discrete optimization, continuous optimization, and statistical estimation. This perspective reveals why SBR works well and connects it to a broader class of optimization algorithms.\n\nProximal Operator Theory\nThe proximal operator of a function \\(g: \\mathbb{R}^p \\to \\mathbb{R} \\cup \\{+\\infty\\}\\) is defined as: \\[\n\\text{prox}_{\\gamma g}(v) = \\arg\\min_{u} \\left\\{ g(u) + \\frac{1}{2\\gamma}\\|u - v\\|_2^2 \\right\\}\n\\]\nThis operator balances two competing objectives: function minimization by making \\(g(u)\\) small, and proximity by staying close to the input point \\(v\\). The parameter \\(\\gamma &gt; 0\\) controls the tradeoff between these objectives. The proximal operator generalizes the notion of gradient descent to non-smooth functions and provides a principled way to handle non-differentiable penalties.\n\n\nProximal Operator for the \\(\\ell_0\\) Norm\nFor the \\(\\ell_0\\) penalty \\(g(\\beta) = \\lambda\\|\\beta\\|_0\\), the proximal operator has a particularly simple form:\n\\[\n\\text{prox}_{\\gamma \\lambda \\|\\cdot\\|_0}(v) = \\arg\\min_{\\beta} \\left\\{ \\lambda\\|\\beta\\|_0 + \\frac{1}{2\\gamma}\\|\\beta - v\\|_2^2 \\right\\}\n\\]\nThe solution is given by hard thresholding: \\[\n[\\text{prox}_{\\gamma \\lambda \\|\\cdot\\|_0}(v)]_j = \\begin{cases}\nv_j & \\text{if } |v_j| &gt; \\sqrt{2\\gamma\\lambda} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThis can be written compactly as: \\[\n\\text{prox}_{\\gamma \\lambda \\|\\cdot\\|_0}(v) = v \\odot \\mathbf{1}_{|v| &gt; \\sqrt{2\\gamma\\lambda}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\odot\\) denotes element-wise multiplication and \\(\\mathbf{1}_{|v| &gt; \\sqrt{2\\gamma\\lambda}}\\) is the indicator vector.\n\n\nConnection to Proximal Gradient Methods\nThe general proximal gradient method for solving \\(\\min_{\\beta} f(\\beta) + g(\\beta)\\) (where \\(f\\) is smooth and \\(g\\) is potentially non-smooth) proceeds by:\n\\[\n\\beta^{(k+1)} = \\text{prox}_{\\gamma_k g}\\left(\\beta^{(k)} - \\gamma_k \\nabla f(\\beta^{(k)})\\right)\n\\]\nFor the \\(\\ell_0\\)-regularized least squares problem, we have \\(f(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|y - X\\beta\\|_2^2\\) (smooth, quadratic), \\(g(\\beta) = \\lambda\\|\\beta\\|_0\\) (non-smooth, combinatorial), and \\(\\nabla f(\\beta) = X^T(X\\beta - y)\\).\nThe proximal gradient update becomes: \\[\n\\beta^{(k+1)} = \\text{prox}_{\\gamma_k \\lambda \\|\\cdot\\|_0}\\left(\\beta^{(k)} - \\gamma_k X^T(X\\beta^{(k)} - y)\\right)\n\\]\nThis is exactly iterative hard thresholding (IHT), a well-known algorithm for sparse optimization.\n\n\nHow SBR Implements Proximal Updates\nWhile SBR doesn’t explicitly compute the full proximal gradient step, it implements the same underlying principle in a coordinate-wise manner through coordinate selection where SBR considers each coordinate \\(j\\) individually, local optimization where each coordinate solves the reduced problem, and hard thresholding where the decision to include or exclude a variable is equivalent to hard thresholding.\nSpecifically, when SBR considers adding variable \\(j\\) to the active set \\(S\\), it’s effectively solving: \\[\n\\min_{\\beta_j} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{2}\\|r_{-j} - x_j \\beta_j\\|_2^2 + \\lambda \\mathbf{1}_{\\beta_j \\neq 0} \\right\\}\n\\]\nwhere \\(r_{-j}\\) is the residual after fitting all other active variables. The solution is: \\[\n\\hat{\\beta}_j = \\begin{cases}\n(x_j^T r_{-j})/(x_j^T x_j) & \\text{if } \\frac{1}{2}(x_j^T r_{-j})^2/(x_j^T x_j) &gt; \\lambda \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThis is precisely the coordinate-wise hard thresholding operation.\n\n\nComparison with Other Proximal Methods\nLasso (\\(\\ell_1\\) penalty): \\[\n\\text{prox}_{\\gamma \\lambda \\|\\cdot\\|_1}(v) = \\text{sign}(v) \\odot \\max(|v| - \\gamma\\lambda, 0)\n\\] This is soft thresholding, which shrinks coefficients gradually toward zero.\nRidge (\\(\\ell_2\\) penalty): \\[\n\\text{prox}_{\\gamma \\lambda \\|\\cdot\\|_2^2}(v) = \\frac{v}{1 + 2\\gamma\\lambda}\n\\] This applies uniform shrinkage to all coefficients.\nElastic Net: Combines soft thresholding with uniform shrinkage.\nThe key difference is that hard thresholding (SBR/\\(\\ell_0\\)) makes discrete decisions (include/exclude), while soft thresholding (Lasso) makes continuous shrinkage decisions.\n\n\nTheoretical Insights from Proximal Perspective\nFixed Point Characterization: A point \\(\\beta^*\\) is a stationary point of the \\(\\ell_0\\)-regularized problem if and only if: \\[\n\\beta^* = \\text{prox}_{\\gamma \\lambda \\|\\cdot\\|_0}(\\beta^* - \\gamma \\nabla f(\\beta^*))\n\\]\nThis provides a theoretical characterization of SBR’s stopping condition.\nThe proximal perspective allows us to leverage convergence theory from proximal gradient methods, providing subsequential convergence to stationary points, linear convergence under restricted strong convexity conditions, and global convergence for coordinate descent variants.\nRegularization Path: The proximal perspective explains why SBR produces piecewise-constant regularization paths. As \\(\\lambda\\) varies, the hard thresholding boundary \\(\\sqrt{2\\gamma\\lambda}\\) changes, leading to discrete changes in the active set.\n\n\nExtensions and Generalizations\nBlock Proximal Operators: For grouped variables, define block hard thresholding: \\[\n[\\text{prox}_{\\gamma \\lambda \\|\\cdot\\|_{0,\\text{group}}}(v)]_G = \\begin{cases}\nv_G & \\text{if } \\frac{1}{2}\\|v_G\\|_2^2 &gt; \\gamma\\lambda \\\\\n\\mathbf{0} & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nAdaptive Thresholding: Use different thresholds for different coordinates: \\[\n[\\text{prox}_{\\gamma \\Lambda \\|\\cdot\\|_0}(v)]_j = v_j \\mathbf{1}_{|v_j| &gt; \\sqrt{2\\gamma\\lambda_j}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Lambda = \\text{diag}(\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_p)\\).\nSmoothed Proximal Operators: Approximate hard thresholding with smooth functions for better optimization properties: \\[\n\\text{prox}_{\\gamma g_\\epsilon}(v) \\approx \\text{prox}_{\\gamma \\lambda \\|\\cdot\\|_0}(v)\n\\]\nwhere \\(g_\\epsilon\\) is a smooth approximation to \\(\\lambda\\|\\cdot\\|_0\\).\n\n\nComputational Advantages\nThe proximal perspective reveals several computational advantages of SBR. The \\(\\ell_0\\) proximal operator demonstrates separability across coordinates, enabling parallel computation. Each coordinate subproblem has exact closed-form solutions, eliminating the need for iterative solvers. Hard thresholding operations require only efficient comparison operations rather than complex numerical computations. Finally, previous solutions provide excellent warm start initializations for nearby parameter values in regularization path computations.\nThis perspective unifies SBR with other sparsity-inducing algorithms and provides a theoretical foundation for understanding its behavior and developing extensions.\n\n\nSpike-and-Slab Examples: Bernoulli-Gaussian and Bernoulli-Laplace\nTo illustrate the practical implications of different spike-and-slab priors in the proximal framework, we examine two important cases: Bernoulli-Gaussian and Bernoulli-Laplace priors. These examples demonstrate how different prior specifications lead to different shrinkage behaviors and associated penalty functions.\nFor the normal means problem where \\(y \\mid \\beta \\sim N(\\beta, \\sigma^2)\\) with Bernoulli-Gaussian prior \\(\\beta \\sim (1-\\theta)\\delta_0 + \\theta N(0, \\sigma_\\beta^2)\\), the marginal distribution of \\(y\\) is: \\[\ny \\mid \\theta \\sim (1-\\theta) N(0, \\sigma^2) + \\theta N(0, \\sigma^2 + \\sigma_\\beta^2)\n\\]\nThe posterior mean takes the form: \\[\n\\hat{\\beta}^{BG} = w(y) y\n\\] where the weight function is: \\[\nw(y) = \\frac{\\sigma_\\beta^2}{\\sigma^2 + \\sigma_\\beta^2} \\left(1 + \\frac{(1-\\theta)\\phi(y/\\sigma)}{\\theta\\phi(y/\\sqrt{\\sigma^2 + \\sigma_\\beta^2})\\sqrt{1 + \\sigma_\\beta^2/\\sigma^2}}\\right)^{-1}\n\\]\nand \\(\\phi(\\cdot)\\) denotes the standard normal density.\nFor the Bernoulli-Laplace prior \\(\\beta \\sim (1-\\theta)\\delta_0 + \\theta \\text{Laplace}(0, b)\\), the expressions become more complex, involving the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\n\n\nPosterior mean functions for Bernoulli-Gaussian (left) and Bernoulli-Laplace (right) priors\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\n# Parameters\ny_vals &lt;- seq(-5, 5, length.out = 1000)\nsigma &lt;- 1\ntheta &lt;- 0.1\nsigma_beta_vals &lt;- c(0.5, 1, 2)\n\n# Bernoulli-Gaussian posterior mean\nbg_posterior_mean &lt;- function(y, sigma, theta, sigma_beta) {\n  var_spike &lt;- sigma^2\n  var_slab &lt;- sigma^2 + sigma_beta^2\n  \n  weight_factor &lt;- (1 - theta) * dnorm(y, 0, sqrt(var_spike)) / \n                   (theta * dnorm(y, 0, sqrt(var_slab)))\n  \n  weight &lt;- (sigma_beta^2 / var_slab) / (1 + weight_factor)\n  return(weight * y)\n}\n\n# Bernoulli-Laplace posterior mean (simplified approximation)\nbl_posterior_mean &lt;- function(y, sigma, theta, b) {\n  # Simplified version - in practice this involves complex integrals\n  weight_gaussian &lt;- (1 - theta) * dnorm(y, 0, sigma)\n  weight_laplace &lt;- theta * (1/(2*b)) * exp(-abs(y)/b) * exp(sigma^2/(2*b^2)) * \n                   (pnorm(-y/sigma - sigma/b) + pnorm(y/sigma - sigma/b))\n  \n  total_weight &lt;- weight_gaussian + weight_laplace\n  weight &lt;- weight_laplace / total_weight\n  \n  # Simplified shrinkage factor\n  shrinkage_factor &lt;- y - sign(y) * pmax(0, abs(y) - sqrt(2) * sigma/b)\n  return(weight * shrinkage_factor + (1 - weight) * 0)\n}\n\n# Create data for plotting\nplot_data_bg &lt;- expand.grid(y = y_vals, sigma_beta = sigma_beta_vals)\nplot_data_bg$posterior_mean &lt;- mapply(bg_posterior_mean, \n                                     plot_data_bg$y, sigma, theta, plot_data_bg$sigma_beta)\nplot_data_bg$sigma_beta_label &lt;- paste(\"σ_β =\", plot_data_bg$sigma_beta)\n\nplot_data_bl &lt;- expand.grid(y = y_vals, b = sigma_beta_vals)\nplot_data_bl$posterior_mean &lt;- mapply(bl_posterior_mean, \n                                     plot_data_bl$y, sigma, theta, plot_data_bl$b)\nplot_data_bl$b_label &lt;- paste(\"b =\", plot_data_bl$b)\n\n# Bernoulli-Gaussian plot\np1 &lt;- ggplot(plot_data_bg, aes(x = y, y = posterior_mean, color = sigma_beta_label)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(x = \"y\", y = \"E[β|y]\", title = \"Bernoulli-Gaussian Prior\",\n       color = \"Parameter\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  xlim(-5, 5) + ylim(-3, 3)\n\n# Bernoulli-Laplace plot  \np2 &lt;- ggplot(plot_data_bl, aes(x = y, y = posterior_mean, color = b_label)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(x = \"y\", y = \"E[β|y]\", title = \"Bernoulli-Laplace Prior\",\n       color = \"Parameter\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  xlim(-5, 5) + ylim(-3, 3)\n\ngrid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Posterior mean functions for Bernoulli-Gaussian (left) and Bernoulli-Laplace (right) priors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenalty functions φ associated with Bernoulli-Gaussian (left) and Bernoulli-Laplace (right) posterior means\n# Penalty function computation (numerical approximation)\ncompute_penalty_bg &lt;- function(z, sigma, theta, sigma_beta) {\n  # Find y such that posterior mean equals z\n  objective &lt;- function(y) (bg_posterior_mean(y, sigma, theta, sigma_beta) - z)^2\n  \n  # Use optimization to find y\n  tryCatch({\n    y_opt &lt;- optimize(objective, interval = c(-10, 10))$minimum\n    penalty &lt;- -0.5 * (y_opt - z)^2 / sigma^2 - log(\n      (1 - theta) * dnorm(y_opt, 0, sigma) + \n      theta * dnorm(y_opt, 0, sqrt(sigma^2 + sigma_beta^2))\n    )\n    return(penalty)\n  }, error = function(e) return(NA))\n}\n\ncompute_penalty_bl &lt;- function(z, sigma, theta, b) {\n  # Penalty function for Bernoulli-Laplace: phi(beta) = -log p(beta)\n  # where p(beta) = (1-theta)*delta_0(beta) + theta * (1/(2b)) * exp(-|beta|/b)\n  \n  if (abs(z) &lt;

    "text": "1.8 Final Thoughts\nThis chapter has traced a remarkable intellectual journey from classical maximum likelihood estimation to modern Bayesian regularization, revealing deep connections that underpin much of contemporary artificial intelligence and machine learning theory. What emerges is not merely a collection of statistical techniques, but a unified theoretical framework that bridges frequentist and Bayesian paradigms while providing principled solutions to the fundamental challenges of learning from data.\nOur exploration began with a sobering revelation: the maximum likelihood estimator, long considered the gold standard of classical statistics, is inadmissible in high-dimensional settings. Stein’s paradox demonstrates that for \\(p \\geq 3\\) dimensions, there always exist estimators with uniformly lower risk than the MLE. This is not merely a theoretical curiosity—in the normal means problem with \\(p=100\\), the James-Stein estimator can achieve 67 times lower risk than the MLE. This dramatic improvement illustrates why classical approaches often fail in modern high-dimensional problems and why shrinkage methods have become essential tools in contemporary data science.\nThe James-Stein estimator’s success stems from its ability to “borrow strength” across components through global shrinkage, demonstrating that multivariate estimation problems are fundamentally easier than their univariate counterparts when approached with appropriate regularization. However, global shrinkage alone is insufficient for sparse signals, motivating the development of more sophisticated approaches that can adapt to local signal structure.\nA central theme throughout this chapter is the profound duality between Bayesian priors and regularization penalties. Every regularization term \\(\\lambda \\phi(f)\\) corresponds to a prior distribution through the relationship \\(\\phi(f) = -\\log p(f)\\), making maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation equivalent to penalized optimization. This duality provides both theoretical justification for regularization methods and practical guidance for prior specification:\n\nPenalty types and their corresponding prior distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nPenalty Type\nPrior Distribution\nKey Property/Behavior\n\n\n\n\nRidge regression\n\\(\\ell_2\\) penalty\nGaussian priors\nEncourages smoothness and numerical stability\n\n\nLasso regression\n\\(\\ell_1\\) penalty\nLaplace priors\nInduces sparsity through soft thresholding\n\n\nBridge regression\n\\(\\ell_\\alpha\\) penalty\nExponential power priors\nInterpolates between Ridge and Lasso; oracle properties\n\n\nHorseshoe regression\nHeavy-tailed penalty\nHorseshoe priors\nOptimal sparsity with strong signals preserved\n\n\nSubset selection\n\\(\\ell_0\\) penalty\nSpike-and-slab priors\nProvides exact sparsity through hard thresholding\n\n\n\nThis mapping reveals why certain penalties work well for particular problem types and guides the selection of appropriate regularization strategies based on problem structure and prior beliefs about the solution. Figure 1.6 shows the unit balls defined by the norms induced by different priors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Horseshoe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Cauchy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Comparison of unit balls for norms induced by different priors\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6 (a) Shows the unit balls for penalty norms induced by the horseshoe prior. It demonstrates several remarkable properties that make it particularly effective for sparse estimation problems. Its penalty function \\(\\phi(\\theta_i) = -\\log(\\log(1 + 2\\tau^2/\\theta_i^2))\\) exhibits a unique double-logarithmic structure that creates an ideal balance between sparsity induction and signal preservation. In multivariate settings, the penalty simply sums across components: \\(\\phi(\\theta) = \\sum_i \\phi(\\theta_i)\\).\nThe horseshoe’s most distinctive characteristic is its asymmetric shrinkage behavior. Near the origin, when parameters approach zero, the penalty function grows to infinity, creating extremely strong shrinkage that encourages exact zeros and thus induces sparsity. However, for large parameter values, the penalty grows slowly, allowing large signals to escape penalization with minimal distortion. This behavior is fundamentally different from methods like Lasso, which applies uniform shrinkage regardless of signal magnitude.\nThe global shrinkage parameter \\(\\tau\\) provides crucial control over the prior’s behavior. Smaller values of \\(\\tau\\) impose more aggressive shrinkage across all parameters, while larger values become more permissive, allowing signals to emerge more easily. This parameter effectively controls the trade-off between sparsity and signal detection.\nFrom a theoretical perspective, the horseshoe prior achieves optimal minimax convergence rates of \\(O(s \\log(p/s))\\) for \\(s\\)-sparse vectors, making it particularly well-suited for “needle-in-a-haystack” problems where researchers seek to identify a few large signals among many noise variables. Under appropriate regularity conditions, the horseshoe also possesses oracle properties, meaning it can correctly identify the true signal structure.\nThe geometric visualization reveals why this prior is so effective. The characteristic “horseshoe” shape displays concave contours near the coordinate axes, reflecting strong shrinkage toward zero, while showing convex contours away from the origin, indicating minimal shrinkage for large coefficients. Unlike the Lasso’s diamond shape or Ridge’s circular contours, the horseshoe’s heavy tails allow large coefficients to escape penalization entirely.\nThis comprehensive visualization demonstrates why the horseshoe prior has become increasingly popular for modern high-dimensional problems where the true signal structure is sparse but individual signals may be large in magnitude. The prior’s ability to provide aggressive shrinkage for noise while preserving signal integrity makes it an ideal choice for contemporary machine learning applications.\nOur analysis reveals a rich spectrum of approaches to sparsity, each with distinct theoretical properties and practical advantages:\n\nTable: Method categories and their key properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod Category\nExamples\nKey Properties\nAdvantages\nLimitations\n\n\n\n\nGlobal shrinkage methods\nJames-Stein, Ridge regression\nUniform regularization across all parameters\nComputationally simple and numerically stable\nCannot adapt to local signal structure; may over-shrink large signals in sparse settings\n\n\nAdaptive shrinkage methods\nLasso, horseshoe priors\nDifferential shrinkage based on signal strength\nLasso: soft thresholding; Horseshoe: aggressive shrinkage for small signals while preserving large ones; achieves optimal minimax rate \\(p_n \\log(n/p_n)\\)\nHorseshoe particularly effective for “needle-in-a-haystack” problems\n\n\nVariable selection methods\nSpike-and-slab priors, \\(\\ell_0\\) regularization\nDiscrete inclusion/exclusion decisions\nMost interpretable sparse solutions; can achieve oracle properties under appropriate conditions\nCombinatorially challenging\n\n\n\nBuilding on the theoretical foundations and geometric intuition developed above, we can distill several actionable guidelines for practitioners and researchers working with regularized models and sparse estimation. These practical insights help bridge the gap between abstract theory and real-world application, informing the choice of methods and priors in diverse statistical and machine learning contexts:\n\nPractical guidelines for regularized models and sparse estimation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario\nRecommended Methods\nRationale / Notes\n\n\n\n\nLow-dimensional problems (\\(p &lt; n\\))\nRidge regression\nProvides numerical stability; often sufficient for moderate \\(p\\)\n\n\nHigh-dimensional sparse problems\nLasso, Bridge regression (\\(\\alpha \\approx 0.7\\)), Horseshoe priors\nLasso balances efficiency and sparsity; Bridge and Horseshoe offer better statistical properties\n\n\nUltra-sparse problems\nSpike-and-slab priors, \\(\\ell_0\\) methods (e.g., SBR)\nAchieve optimal performance and exact sparsity\n\n\nCorrelated predictors\nBridge regression, full Bayesian approaches\nHandle correlation better than Lasso, which may select variables arbitrarily\n\n\nUncertainty quantification is crucial\nFull Bayesian methods\nProvide credible intervals and posterior probabilities, unlike point estimates\n\n\n\nWhile our focus has been on linear models, the principles developed here extend broadly to modern AI systems. Deep learning architectures routinely employ regularization techniques (dropout, weight decay, batch normalization) that can be understood through the Bayesian lens developed in this chapter. The success of techniques like variational autoencoders and Bayesian neural networks demonstrates the continued relevance of probabilistic thinking in contemporary machine learning.\nMoreover, the sparse estimation techniques discussed here are fundamental to interpretable AI, compressed sensing, and efficient neural architecture design. The theoretical insights about when different regularization approaches succeed provide guidance for designing and analyzing complex learning systems.\nThe evolution from maximum likelihood estimation to sophisticated Bayesian regularization represents more than technical progress—it reflects a fundamental shift in how we approach learning from data. Rather than seeking single “best” estimates, modern methods embrace uncertainty, incorporate prior knowledge, and adaptively balance model complexity with empirical fit.\nThe remarkable fact that Bayesian approaches often dominate classical frequentist methods, even from a frequentist perspective (as demonstrated by Stein’s paradox), suggests that probabilistic thinking provides not just philosophical appeal but concrete practical advantages. In an era of ever-growing data complexity and dimensionality, these theoretical insights become increasingly valuable for developing robust, interpretable, and effective learning algorithms.\nThe unified framework presented in this chapter—connecting classical statistics, Bayesian inference, optimization theory, and modern machine learning—provides both historical perspective and forward-looking guidance for the continued development of artificial intelligence systems. As we confront increasingly complex learning challenges, from personalized medicine to autonomous systems, the principled approach to regularization and uncertainty quantification developed here will remain fundamental to building trustworthy and effective AI systems.\n\n\n\n\nAndrews, D.

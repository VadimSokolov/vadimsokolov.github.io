SOLUTIONS
Section A: Systems of Equations
1. A movie theater sold 50 tickets and collected $540. Adult tickets cost $12 each and child tickets cost $8 each. How many of each type of ticket were sold? 
Solution:
* Let 'a' be the number of adult tickets and 'c' be the number of child tickets.
* Set up the equations based on the given information:
   * Equation for total tickets: a + c = 50
   * Equation for total money collected: 12a + 8c = 540
* From the first equation, express 'a' in terms of 'c': a = 50 - c.
* Substitute this into the second equation: 12(50 - c) + 8c = 540.
* Solve for 'c':
   * 600 - 12c + 8c = 540
   * 600 - 4c = 540
   * 60 = 4c
   * c = 15
* Substitute the value of 'c' back into the equation for 'a': a = 50 - 15 = 35.
* Answer: 35 adult tickets and 15 child tickets were sold.
2. The sum of two numbers is 40, and their difference is 10. What are the two numbers? Solution:
* Let the two numbers be 'x' and 'y'.
* Set up the equations:
   * x + y = 40
   * x - y = 10
* Add the two equations together to eliminate 'y': (x + y) + (x - y) = 40 + 10.
* 2x = 50, so x = 25.
* Substitute the value of 'x' into the first equation: 25 + y = 40.
* Solve for 'y': y = 15.
* Answer: The two numbers are 25 and 15.
3. A school sold a total of 200 raffle tickets. Student tickets cost $1 and adult tickets cost $3. If the school collected $360, how many of each type were sold? 
Solution:
* Let 's' be the number of student tickets and 'a' be the number of adult tickets.
* Set up the equations:
   * s + a = 200
   * s + 3a = 360
* From the first equation, s = 200 - a.
* Substitute this into the second equation: (200 - a) + 3a = 360.
* Solve for 'a':
   * 200 + 2a = 360
   * 2a = 160
   * a = 80
* Substitute the value of 'a' back into the equation for 's': s = 200 - 80 = 120.
* Answer: 120 student tickets and 80 adult tickets were sold.
4. Two angles are supplementary. One angle is 12 more than twice the other. What are the measures of the two angles? 
Solution:
* Supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees. Let the two angles be 'x' and 'y'.
* Set up the equations:
   * x + y = 180
   * x = 2y + 12
* Substitute the second equation into the first: (2y + 12) + y = 180.
* Solve for 'y':
   * 3y + 12 = 180
   * 3y = 168
   * y = 56
* Substitute the value of 'y' back into the second equation to find 'x': x = 2(56) + 12 = 112 + 12 = 124.
* Answer: The measures of the two angles are 124 degrees and 56 degrees.
5. A small fair charges $2 for children and $5 for adults. On one day, 260 people entered the fair and $820 was collected. How many children and how many adults attended? Solution:
* Let 'c' be the number of children and 'a' be the number of adults.
* Set up the equations:
   * c + a = 260
   * 2c + 5a = 820
* From the first equation, c = 260 - a.
* Substitute this into the second equation: 2(260 - a) + 5a = 820.
* Solve for 'a':
   * 520 - 2a + 5a = 820
   * 520 + 3a = 820
   * 3a = 300
   * a = 100
* Substitute the value of 'a' back into the equation for 'c': c = 260 - 100 = 160.
* Answer: 160 children and 100 adults attended.
6. A rectangle has a perimeter of 60 cm. The length is 3 cm more than twice the width. Find the dimensions of the rectangle. 
Solution:
* Let 'L' be the length and 'W' be the width of the rectangle.
* The formula for the perimeter is P = 2L + 2W.
* Set up the equations:
   * 2L + 2W = 60, which simplifies to L + W = 30.
   * L = 2W + 3
* Substitute the second equation into the simplified first equation: (2W + 3) + W = 30.
* Solve for 'W':
   * 3W + 3 = 30
   * 3W = 27
   * W = 9
* Substitute the value of 'W' back into the second equation to find 'L': L = 2(9) + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21.
* Answer: The length is 21 cm and the width is 9 cm.
7. The sum of the ages of a father and his daughter is 48. Five years ago, the father was three times as old as the daughter. How old are they now? 
Solution:
* Let 'f' be the father's current age and 'd' be the daughter's current age.
* Set up the equations based on their current ages and ages five years ago:
   * f + d = 48
   * (f - 5) = 3(d - 5)
* Simplify the second equation: f - 5 = 3d - 15, which gives f = 3d - 10.
* Substitute this expression for 'f' into the first equation: (3d - 10) + d = 48.
* Solve for 'd':
   * 4d - 10 = 48
   * 4d = 58
   * d = 14.5
* Substitute the value of 'd' back into the first equation to find 'f': f + 14.5 = 48, so f = 33.5.
* Answer: The father is 33.5 years old and the daughter is 14.5 years old.
8. A store sells 3 pens and 2 notebooks for $4.50. The same store sells 2 pens and 4 notebooks for $5.00. How much does one pen and one notebook cost? 
Solution:
* Let 'p' be the cost of one pen and 'n' be the cost of one notebook.
* Set up the equations:
   * 3p + 2n = 4.50
   * 2p + 4n = 5.00
* Multiply the first equation by 2 to make the 'n' coefficients match for elimination: 6p + 4n = 9.00.
* Subtract the second original equation from this new equation: (6p + 4n) - (2p + 4n) = 9.00 - 5.00.
* 4p = 4.00, so p = 1.00.
* Substitute the value of 'p' into the second original equation: 2(1.00) + 4n = 5.00.
* Solve for 'n':
   * 2.00 + 4n = 5.00
   * 4n = 3.00
   * n = 0.75
* Answer: One pen costs $1.00 and one notebook costs $0.75.
9. A group of 5 pencils and 3 erasers costs $2.70. Another group of 2 pencils and 4 erasers costs $2.20. What is the cost of each pencil and each eraser? 
Solution:
* Let 'p' be the cost of a pencil and 'e' be the cost of an eraser.
* Set up the equations:
   * 5p + 3e = 2.70
   * 2p + 4e = 2.20
* Use the elimination method. Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 5:
   * 10p + 6e = 5.40
   * 10p + 20e = 11.00
* Subtract the new first equation from the new second equation: (10p + 20e) - (10p + 6e) = 11.00 - 5.40.
* 14e = 5.60, so e = 0.40.
* Substitute the value of 'e' into the original second equation: 2p + 4(0.40) = 2.20.
* Solve for 'p':
   * 2p + 1.60 = 2.20
   * 2p = 0.60
   * p = 0.30
* Answer: A pencil costs $0.30 and an eraser costs $0.40.
10. A restaurant serves a meal combo that includes a sandwich and a drink. Two sandwiches and three drinks cost $18. Three sandwiches and two drinks cost $20. What is the cost of one sandwich and one drink? 
Solution:
* Let 's' be the cost of a sandwich and 'd' be the cost of a drink.
* Set up the equations:
   * 2s + 3d = 18
   * 3s + 2d = 20
* To find the cost of one sandwich and one drink (s+d), add the two equations together:
* (2s + 3d) + (3s + 2d) = 18 + 20.
* 5s + 5d = 38.
* Factor out 5: 5(s + d) = 38.
* Divide by 5: s + d = 38 / 5 = 7.60.
* Answer: The cost of one sandwich and one drink is $7.60.

* Answer: The length of the other leg is 12.
14. Find the distance between the points (3, 4) and (7, 1). 
Solution:
* Use the distance formula: d = sqrt( (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 ).
* Plug in the coordinates: d = sqrt( (7 - 3)^2 + (1 - 4)^2 ).
* d = sqrt( 4^2 + (-3)^2 ).

* Answer: The midpoint is (5, 8).
16. A triangle has sides of lengths 5, 12, and 13. Show that it is a right triangle. 
Solution:
* Use the converse of the Pythagorean theorem, which states that if the square of the longest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (c^2 = a^2 + b^2), then the triangle is a right triangle.
* Longest side (hypotenuse 'c') = 13. The other two sides are 'a' = 5 and 'b' = 12.
* Calculate the sum of the squares of the legs: 5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169.

* Since 169 = 169, the triangle is a right triangle.
17. A square has a diagonal length of 10 cm. Find the length of each side. 
Solution:
* The diagonal of a square divides it into two congruent right triangles, where the sides of the square ('s') are the legs and the diagonal ('d') is the hypotenuse.
* Using the Pythagorean theorem: s^2 + s^2 = d^2.
* 2s^2 = 10^2 = 100.

* Answer: The area is 30.
19. The coordinates of a triangle's vertices are A(2,3), B(2,7), and C(6,3). Prove whether triangle ABC is a right triangle. 
Solution:
* A triangle is a right triangle if two of its sides are perpendicular. We can check this by finding the slopes of the sides.
* Slope of side AB: m = (7-3) / (2-2) = 4/0, which is undefined. This means AB is a vertical line.
* Slope of side AC: m = (3-3) / (6-2) = 0/4 = 0. This means AC is a horizontal line.
* Since a vertical line and a horizontal line are perpendicular, the angle at vertex A is a right angle (90 degrees).
* Answer: Triangle ABC is a right triangle because side AB is vertical and side AC is horizontal, making them perpendicular.
20. A line segment has endpoints at (-3, 2) and (5, -4). Find the length of the segment. Solution:
* Use the distance formula: d = sqrt( (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 ).

* d = sqrt( (5+3)^2 + (-6)^2 ).
* d = sqrt( 8^2 + (-6)^2 ) = sqrt(64 + 36) = sqrt(100).
* d = 10.
* Answer: The length of the segment is 10.

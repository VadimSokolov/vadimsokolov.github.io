Section C: Experimental Design
21. A scientist wants to test if a new type of feed makes chickens lay more eggs. Design a controlled experiment. What is your independent variable, dependent variable, control group, and at least two constants?
22. An experiment is conducted to determine the optimal temperature for seed germination. Five groups of seeds are placed in incubators at 10°C, 15°C, 20°C, 25°C, and 30°C. After 7 days, the number of germinated seeds in each group is counted. Identify a potential flaw in this experimental design.
23. To test the effectiveness of a new insect repellent, a researcher sprays one arm of 50 volunteers with the repellent and leaves the other arm unsprayed.

SOLUTIONS
Section A: Punnett Squares
1. Solution: We can figure this out by looking at each trait on its own. For the fire-breathing trait (Ff x Ff), combining the parental alleles gives four possibilities: FF, Ff, Ff, and ff. This means there's a 1/4 chance of an offspring that can't breathe fire (ff). Similarly, for scale color (Gg x Gg), the four possible combinations are GG, Gg, Gg, and gg. This gives a 1/4 chance of an offspring with gold scales (gg). To find the probability of both things happening together, we multiply their individual chances: 1/4 x 1/4 = 1/16.
   * Answer: 1/16
2. Solution: To find the possible outcomes, we can combine the alleles from each parent. The father can pass on an A or an O allele, and the mother can pass on a B or an O allele. If the father's A combines with the mother's B, the child's genotype is AB (Type AB blood). If his A combines with her O, the genotype is AO (Type A blood). If his O combines with her B, the genotype is BO (Type B blood). Finally, if his O combines with her O, the genotype is OO (Type O blood).
   * Answer: Type AB, Type A, Type B, and Type O
3. Solution: Let's trace the parental chromosomes. The mother can pass on either an XH or an Xh allele, while the father can pass on either an XH or a Y chromosome. This gives four potential outcomes. If the mother's XH combines with the father's XH, they'll have a normal daughter (XHXH). If her XH combines with his Y, they'll have a normal son (XHY). If her Xh combines with his XH, they'll have a carrier daughter (XHXh). And if her Xh combines with his Y, they'll have a son with hemophilia (XhY). Since this is one of four equally likely possibilities, the probability is 1/4.
   * Answer: 1/4 (or 25%)
4. Solution: When we cross two pink snapdragons (RW x RW), each parent contributes either an R or a W allele. This creates four possible combinations in the offspring. An R from the first parent can combine with an R from the second to make an RR (red) flower. An R from the first can combine with a W from the second to make an RW (pink) flower. A W from the first can combine with an R from the second, also making an RW (pink) flower. Finally, a W from each parent makes a WW (white) flower. Out of these four possibilities, only one results in a red flower.
   * Answer: 25%
5. Solution: This cross is straightforward because each parent can only produce one type of gamete. The tall, yellow parent (TTYY) can only pass on dominant alleles, so all its gametes are TY. The short, green parent (ttyy) can only pass on recessive alleles, so all its gametes are ty. When fertilization occurs, the only possible combination is a TY gamete meeting a ty gamete, resulting in an offspring with the genotype TtYy.
   * Answer: TtYy
6. Solution: In this cross (TtYy x TtYy), each parent can produce four types of gametes: TY, Ty, tY, and ty. Combining these in a large 16-square Punnett square reveals a consistent pattern. You'll find that 9 of the 16 combinations have at least one dominant T and one dominant Y allele, resulting in a Tall, Yellow phenotype. 3 of the 16 will have at least one T but two y alleles (T_yy), resulting in a Tall, Green phenotype. Another 3 will have two t alleles but at least one Y (ttY_), for a Short, Yellow phenotype. Finally, only 1 of the 16 squares will have all recessive alleles (ttyy), for a Short, Green phenotype.
   * Answer: 9:3:3:1
7. Solution: Let's analyze this cross one trait at a time. For fur color (Bb x bb), the first parent can give a B or a b, while the second only gives a b. This results in two Bb offspring and two bb offspring, meaning there's a 1/2 chance of having black fur (Bb). For fur length (Ss x ss), the first parent gives an S or an s, and the second only gives an s. This results in two Ss offspring and two ss offspring, so there's a 1/2 chance of having short fur (Ss). To get the probability of both dominant traits appearing together, we multiply the individual probabilities: 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4.
   * Answer: 1/4
8. Solution: Since both parents are carriers (Cc), each can pass on either a dominant normal allele (C) or a recessive cystic fibrosis allele (c). This leads to four possible combinations for their child. If a C from the mother combines with a C from the father, the child is CC (normal). If a C from one parent combines with a c from the other, the child is Cc (a carrier, but healthy). This can happen in two ways. If a c allele from both parents combine, the child's genotype is cc, and they will have cystic fibrosis. This is one of the four equally likely outcomes.
   * Answer: 1/4 (or 25%)
9. Solution: First, let's figure out the gametes each parent can make. The first bird (BBWw) always passes on a B allele for beak size and can pass on either a W or a w for wing length. Its gametes are BW and Bw. The second bird (bbww) can only pass on recessive alleles, so its only gamete is bw. When we combine these, the first parent's BW gamete and the second's bw gamete create an offspring with the genotype BbWw. The first parent's Bw gamete and the second's bw gamete create an offspring with the genotype Bbww. Those are the only two possibilities.
   * Answer: BbWw and Bbww
10. Solution: A test cross helps us determine an unknown dominant genotype. The tall parent could be either homozygous dominant (TT) or heterozygous (Tt). If the parent were TT, all of its offspring from a cross with tt would be Tt and therefore 100% tall. That doesn't match our results. So, let's assume the parent is heterozygous (Tt). In a cross between Tt and tt, the tall parent passes on a T half the time and a t the other half. The short parent always passes on a t. This means half the offspring will be Tt (tall) and the other half will be tt (short). This matches our 50/50 result perfectly.
   * Answer: Tt (heterozygous)

Section B: Exponential Growth and Decay
11. Solution: 8 hours is four 2-hour periods. So the bacteria will triple 4 times. 100×34=100×81=8100.
   * Answer: 8,100 bacteria
12. Solution: The substance halves every 50 years. 200→100→50→25→12.5. This is 4 half-lives. 4×50=200 years.
   * Answer: 200 years
13. Solution: Semi-annual compounding means the interest is applied twice a year at half the rate. So, 4 periods at 2%.
   * Yr 0.5: 5000×1.02=5100
   * Yr 1: 5100×1.02=5202
   * Yr 1.5: 5202×1.02≈5306
   * Yr 2: 5306×1.02≈5412
   * Answer: ~$5412
14. Solution: After 1 year: 500,000×1.03=515,000. After 2 years: 515,000×1.03=530,450.
   * Answer: 2 years
15. Solution:
   * Month 1: 1000×1.5=1500
   * Month 2: 1500×1.5=2250
   * Month 3: 2250×1.5=3375
   * Month 4: 3375×1.5≈5062
   * Month 5: 5062×1.5≈7593
   * Answer: 5 months
16. Solution: Value retained is 80% or 0.8. 30,000×(0.8)3=30,000×0.512=15,360.
   * Answer: $15,360
17. Solution: After 1 yr: 800×1.1=880. After 2 yrs: 880×1.1=968. After 3 yrs: 968×1.1≈1065.
   * Answer: 3 years
18. Solution: The population doubles in 2 days (from 50 to 200 is two doublings, one from day 1 to 2 and one from day 2 to 3). So, on day 5 (2 days after day 3), the population will double again. 200×2=400.
   * Answer: 400 ants
19. Solution: 6 years is 72 months. 72÷18=4. So there will be 4 doublings. 1×24=16.
   * Answer: 16 units
20. Solution: 24 hours is four 6-hour periods, so four half-lives. 400→200→100→50→25.
   * Answer: 25 mg

Section C: Experimental Design
21. Solution:
   * Independent Variable: Type of feed (new vs. standard).
   * Dependent Variable: Number of eggs laid per chicken per week.
   * Control Group: A group of chickens receiving the standard, old feed.
   * Constants: Breed of chicken, age of chicken, living conditions (coop size, temperature, light exposure), amount of water.
22. Solution: A potential flaw is the lack of a control group at a standard "room temperature" or an established optimal temperature to compare against. Also, it assumes the optimal temperature is within the tested range.
23. Solution: This design choice controls for individual variations in body chemistry and attractiveness to mosquitoes. Any difference in bite count is more likely due to the repellent itself, not differences between people.
24. Solution: The major flaw is the lack of a proper control. The two light sources (green light vs. sunlight) are different, but so is the location. Sunlight contains a full spectrum of light, not just green. A proper control would be a plant under a white light of the same intensity.
25. Solution: Correlation does not imply causation. There could be confounding variables. For example, students who have more time to exercise might also have more time to study, or students who are more disciplined may both exercise regularly and study hard.
26. Solution: The reliability can be improved by conducting multiple trials for each condition (pure water and salt water) and averaging the results. This minimizes the impact of random errors in measurement.
27. Solution: It eliminates bias from both the participants (placebo effect) and the researchers (unconscious bias in evaluating patient outcomes). This ensures that the results are based solely on the drug's chemical effects.
28. Solution: The most significant confounding variable is the pre-existing differences between the student populations and teachers in the two schools. Factors like socioeconomic background, prior academic achievement, and teacher quality could influence the results more than the teaching method.
29. Solution: A control condition is needed where the same participants take the reaction test after consuming a non-caffeinated beverage (a placebo) that is otherwise identical to the caffeinated one.
30. Solution: Temperature can affect the chemical reactions inside a battery and thus its performance and lifespan. Keeping the temperature stable is a crucial constant that ensures the only significant difference between the groups is the brand of the battery.

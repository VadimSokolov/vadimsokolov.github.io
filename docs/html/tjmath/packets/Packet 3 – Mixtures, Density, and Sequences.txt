SOLUTIONS


Section A: Mixtures
Problem 1: A 10-liter solution is 30% acid. How many liters of pure acid must be added to make it a 50% acid solution?
Solution:
         * Start with 10 liters of solution that is 30% acid → 10 × 0.30 = 3 liters of acid.
         * Let x be the liters of pure acid added.
         * Total volume becomes 10 + x, and acid becomes 3 + x.
         * Set up equation: (3 + x) / (10 + x) = 0.5
         * Multiply both sides: 3 + x = 0.5(10 + x)
         * Expand: 3 + x = 5 + 0.5x
         * Subtract 0.5x from both sides: 0.5x = 2
         * Divide: x = 4
         * Answer: 4 liters of pure acid
Problem 2: How many liters of water should be added to 5 liters of a 40% salt solution to reduce it to a 25% salt solution?
Solution:
         * Salt in original = 5 × 0.40 = 2 liters
         * Let x be the liters of water added
         * Total volume = 5 + x
         * Set equation: 2 / (5 + x) = 0.25
         * Multiply both sides: 2 = 0.25(5 + x)
         * Expand: 2 = 1.25 + 0.25x
         * Subtract 1.25: 0.75 = 0.25x → x = 3
         * Answer: 3 liters of water
Problem 3: A tank contains 20 liters of a 25% sugar solution. How much of the solution must be drained and replaced with pure water to get a 10% sugar solution?
Solution:
         * Sugar in 20 liters = 0.25 × 20 = 5 liters
         * Let x liters be drained and replaced with water
         * Draining x liters removes 0.25x sugar
         * Sugar remaining = 5 - 0.25x
         * Total volume remains 20 liters
         * Set equation: (5 - 0.25x)/20 = 0.10
         * Multiply: 5 - 0.25x = 2
         * Solve: 0.25x = 3 → x = 12
         * Answer: Drain and replace 12 liters
Problem 4: You mix 4 liters of a 10% acid solution with 6 liters of a 30% acid solution. What is the concentration of the resulting mixture?
Solution:
         * Acid in first = 4 × 0.10 = 0.4 L
         * Acid in second = 6 × 0.30 = 1.8 L
         * Total acid = 0.4 + 1.8 = 2.2 L
         * Total volume = 10 L
         * Final % = 2.2 / 10 = 22%
Problem 5: How much of a 70% alcohol solution should be mixed with 3 liters of a 30% solution to get a 50% solution?
Solution:
         * Let x = liters of 70% solution
         * Alcohol in 70%: 0.70x
         * Alcohol in 3 L of 30%: 0.30 × 3 = 0.9
         * Total volume: x + 3
         * Set up: (0.70x + 0.9)/(x + 3) = 0.50
         * Multiply: 0.70x + 0.9 = 0.5x + 1.5
         * Rearrange: 0.20x = 0.6 → x = 3
         * Answer: 3 liters
Problem 6: A chemist wants 10 liters of a 40% solution. She has only 25% and 60% solutions. How much of each should she use?
Solution:
         * Let x = liters of 25%, so (10 - x) = liters of 60%
         * Equation: 0.25x + 0.60(10 - x) = 0.40 × 10
         * Simplify: 0.25x + 6 - 0.60x = 4
         * Combine: -0.35x = -2 → x = 5.71
         * Answer: ~5.71 L of 25%, ~4.29 L of 60%
Problem 7: A 12-liter solution is 35% salt. If 3 liters of pure water are added, what is the new concentration?
Solution:
         * Salt = 12 × 0.35 = 4.2 L
         * New volume = 15 L
         * New % = 4.2 / 15 = 28%
Problem 8: 2 liters of a 50% acid solution is mixed with x liters of pure acid to get a 70% acid solution. Find x.
Solution:
         * Acid in 2 L = 2 × 0.5 = 1
         * Acid added = x
         * Total volume = 2 + x
         * Equation: (1 + x)/(2 + x) = 0.7
         * Multiply: 1 + x = 0.7(2 + x)
         * Expand: 1 + x = 1.4 + 0.7x
         * Rearrange: 0.3x = 0.4 → x = 1.33
         * Answer: ~1.33 liters
Problem 9: A 9-liter mix is 1/3 oil. How much oil must be added to make it 50% oil?
Solution:
         * Oil = 9 × 1/3 = 3
         * Let x = oil to add → total = 9 + x, oil = 3 + x
         * Equation: (3 + x)/(9 + x) = 0.5
         * Multiply: 3 + x = 4.5 + 0.5x
         * Rearrange: 0.5x = 1.5 → x = 3
         * Answer: 3 liters of oil
Problem 10: A tank has a 20-liter mixture that is 40% vinegar. If 5 liters are drained and replaced with water, what is the new concentration?
Solution:
         * Vinegar in 20L = 8L
         * 5L removed = 0.40 × 5 = 2L vinegar removed
         * Vinegar left = 8 - 2 = 6L
         * New total volume = 20L
         * New % = 6 / 20 = 30%

Problem 12: An object has a density of 2 g/cm³ and a mass of 500 g. What is its volume?
Solution:
         * Formula: Volume = Mass / Density
         * Calculation: Volume = 500 g / 2 g/cm³
         * Answer: The volume is 250 cm³.
Problem 13: A 150 g rock displaces 60 cm³ of water. What is its density?
Solution:
         * Note: The volume of a submerged object equals the volume of water it displaces.
         * Formula: Density = Mass / Volume
         * Calculation: Density = 150 g / 60 cm³
         * Answer: The rock's density is 2.5 g/cm³.
Problem 14: A cube has a side length of 3 cm and a mass of 270 g. Find the density.
Solution:
         * Step 1: Find the volume. Volume of a cube = side × side × side
         * Volume Calculation: Volume = 3 cm × 3 cm × 3 cm = 27 cm³
         * Step 2: Calculate density. Density = Mass / Volume
         * Density Calculation: Density = 270 g / 27 cm³
         * Answer: The density is 10 g/cm³.
Problem 15: A liquid has a density of 1.2 g/mL. What is the mass of 250 mL?
Solution:
         * Formula: Mass = Density × Volume
         * Calculation: Mass = 1.2 g/mL × 250 mL
         * Answer: The mass is 300 g.
Problem 16: An object has a density of 5 g/cm³ and a volume of 40 cm³. Find the mass.
Solution:
         * Formula: Mass = Density × Volume
         * Calculation: Mass = 5 g/cm³ × 40 cm³

Solution:
         * Object A Density: 100 g / 25 cm³ = 4 g/cm³
         * Object B Density: 120 g / 30 cm³ = 4 g/cm³
         * Answer: Neither is denser; they have the same density.
Problem 18: A hollow object has an outer volume of 100 cm³ and a mass of 200 g. If it has an inner cavity of 20 cm³, what’s its density?
Solution:
         * Note: The density is of the material itself, not the empty space.
         * Step 1: Find the material's volume. Volume = Outer Volume - Inner Cavity Volume
         * Volume Calculation: Volume = 100 cm³ - 20 cm³ = 80 cm³
         * Step 2: Calculate density. Density = Mass / Volume
         * Density Calculation: Density = 200 g / 80 cm³
         * Answer: The density of the material is 2.5 g/cm³.
Problem 19: A ball floats in water but sinks in alcohol. Which has a higher density: the ball or alcohol?
Solution:
         * Reasoning: An object sinks in a fluid if it is denser than the fluid. Since the ball sinks in alcohol, the ball must be denser.
         * Answer: The ball has a higher density than the alcohol.
Problem 20: A tank holds 5 L of a liquid with a density of 0.8 g/mL. What is the mass?
Solution:
         * Step 1: Convert volume to matching units. The density is in g/mL, so we convert liters (L) to milliliters (mL). (1 L = 1000 mL)
         * Volume Conversion: 5 L × 1000 mL/L = 5000 mL
         * Step 2: Calculate mass. Mass = Density × Volume
         * Mass Calculation: Mass = 0.8 g/mL × 5000 mL
         * Answer: The mass is 4000 g (or 4 kg).

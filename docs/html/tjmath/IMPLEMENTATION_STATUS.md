## Recommendation

**For immediate use**: Select focus areas from Packets 1-4 only. These provide 1,200 high-quality, varied math problems with worked solutions.

**Future enhancement**: Packets 5-6 can be implemented when needed. The current 1,200 problems provide substantial practice material.

## Using the Quiz

When selecting focus areas in the quiz app:
1. ✓ Choose any/all areas from Packets 1-4 for full functionality
2. ⚠️ Avoid Packets 5-6 for now (placeholder problems)

The quiz will work perfectly with the 12 implemented focus areas.

## What is Cursor?

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor built on VS Code. It allows you to:

- Write code with AI assistance
- Ask questions about your code
- Generate code from natural language descriptions
- Debug and fix errors with AI help

For this course, we'll use Cursor to build an AI agent without needing deep programming expertise.

2. Type this command and press Enter:

```bash
python --version
```

3. If you see `Python 3.x.x`, you're good! Skip to Part 4.

### Install Python on Mac

**Option A: Using Homebrew (Recommended)**

1. Open Terminal (outside of Cursor)
2. Install Homebrew if you don't have it:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

3. Install Python:

```bash
brew install python
```

**Option B: Direct Download**

1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads)
2. Download the latest Python 3.x version
3. Run the installer
4. **Important:** Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

### Install Python on Windows

1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads)
2. Click "Download Python 3.x.x"
3. Run the installer
4. **IMPORTANT:** Check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"**
5. Click "Install Now"

### Verify Installation

After installation, close and reopen Cursor, then:

1. Open terminal: **View → Terminal**
2. Run:

```bash
python --version
```

3. You should see `Python 3.x.x`

## Part 4: Install Required Packages

Our project needs a few Python libraries. Install them in Cursor's terminal:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

You should see output indicating successful installation.

**If you get a "pip not found" error on Mac:**

```bash
pip3 install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Part 5: Using Cursor's AI Features

### Feature 1: AI Chat (Cmd+L / Ctrl+L)

Use this to ask questions or get help:

1. Press **Cmd+L** (Mac) or **Ctrl+L** (Windows)
2. A chat panel opens on the right
3. Ask questions like:
   - "How do I load a CSV file in Python?"
   - "Explain what this code does"
   - "Why am I getting this error?"

### Feature 2: Inline Edit (Cmd+K / Ctrl+K)

Use this to write or modify code:

1. Select some code (or place cursor where you want new code)
2. Press **Cmd+K** (Mac) or **Ctrl+K** (Windows)
3. Describe what you want in plain English:
   - "Add a function that calculates the average price"
   - "Fix this error"
   - "Add comments explaining this code"
4. Review the suggested changes
5. Press **Enter** to accept or **Escape** to cancel

### Feature 3: Code Completion (Tab)

As you type, Cursor suggests completions:

1. Start typing code
2. You'll see gray "ghost text" suggestions
3. Press **Tab** to accept the suggestion
4. Press **Escape** to dismiss

### Feature 4: Agent Mode (Cmd+I / Ctrl+I)

For larger tasks, use Agent mode:

1. Press **Cmd+I** (Mac) or **Ctrl+I** (Windows)
2. Describe a complex task:
   - "Create a Python script that loads data and builds a regression model"
3. The agent will generate multiple files and complete code

## Part 6: Creating Your First Project

### Step 1: Create a Project Folder

1. In Cursor, go to **File → Open Folder**
2. Navigate to where you want your project (e.g., Documents)
3. Click **New Folder** and name it `oj-pricing-agent`
4. Select this folder and click **Open**

### Step 2: Create a Python File

1. In the Explorer sidebar (left panel), right-click
2. Select **New File**
3. Name it `test.py`
4. Add this code:

```python
print("Hello from Cursor!")
```

### Step 3: Run Your Code

1. Open the terminal: **View → Terminal**
2. Run your script:

```bash
python test.py
```

3. You should see: `Hello from Cursor!`

Congratulations! You're ready to build your AI agent.

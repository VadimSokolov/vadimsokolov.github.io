#### Content and goals
This is a graduate course on Bayesain learning. Although basics will be revisited, the pace will be swift so we can get to advanced topics as quickly as possible. This course details classical Bayesain techniques as well as modern approaches from both statistics and machine learning. We will consider some canonical examples of Bayesain analysis but will concentrate on modern Bayesain techniqes, computation and implementation, as well as modern applications. The course material will emphesize deriving and implementing methods over proving theoretical results. \

During weeks 11-15, this class will be run in a seminar mode. A student or the instructor will lead the discussion.


#### Tentative Schedule/List of Topics 
- Overview: Conditional Probability, Bayes Rule, Bayesain inference, utility theory, distributions and tranformations
- Hierarchical models: Bayesian regression, shrinkage (lasso, horseshoe) 
- Gaussian Process with applications in Bayesian Optimization
  -- Tuning machine learning algorithms
  -- Engineering model calibration
- Algorithms 
	-- Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
	-- Expectation Maximization (EM)
	-- Variational Bayes
- Markov and Hidden Markov Models
	-- Kalman Filter
	-- Particle filter
	-- Dynamic Linear Model
	-- Structural Time Series Models

- Decision Making
- Modeling using known distributions
- Frequentist and Bayesian Inference
- AB Testing
- Regression, Classification and 
- Mixture of expert models
- Tree-based methods
- Temporal data and forecasting
- Deep Learning
- Optimisation and Regularization

#### Case Studies

1. **Self-Driving Cars and the Uber Fatal Crash (2018)**
   *Focus:* Safety, liability, trust in AI, limitations of perception models
   *Key Questions:*

   * What caused the failure in perception?
   * Who is responsible—the AI developer, the safety driver, or Uber?
   * Should fully autonomous driving be paused until X?

2. **COMPAS Algorithm in Criminal Justice**
   *Focus:* Algorithmic bias, fairness, transparency
   *Key Questions:*

   * Why did COMPAS exhibit racial bias?
   * Can AI be truly unbiased?
   * Should such models be used in sentencing?

3. **AI in Healthcare: IBM Watson for Oncology**
   *Focus:* Promise vs reality, hype cycle, trust in clinical AI
   *Key Questions:*

   * Why did Watson fail to meet expectations?
   * What lessons can we learn for future medical AI systems?

4. **Deepfakes and Synthetic Media**
   *Focus:* Misinformation, regulation, detection vs creation arms race
   *Key Questions:*

   * Who should be held accountable for deepfake misuse?
   * Are technical detection solutions sufficient?

5. **ChatGPT and Large Language Models in Education**
   *Focus:* Plagiarism, learning integrity, productivity vs dependence
   *Key Questions:*

   * Should universities ban or embrace AI tools in coursework?
   * How do we ensure critical thinking is preserved?

6. **AI in Hiring: Amazon’s Recruitment Tool Bias**
   *Focus:* Gender bias, explainability, data-driven discrimination
   *Key Questions:*

   * Why did the hiring algorithm become biased?
   * How should companies audit AI systems for fairness?

7. **AI in Warfare: Lethal Autonomous Weapons (LAWS)**
   *Focus:* Ethics, accountability, international law
   *Key Questions:*

   * Should AI be allowed to make life-and-death decisions?
   * What governance models could prevent misuse?

8. **AI for Social Good: Predictive Models for Disease Outbreaks (e.g., BlueDot and COVID-19)**
   *Focus:* Success stories, limitations, data privacy
   *Key Questions:*

   * Why was BlueDot successful in early COVID detection?
   * How can similar models be scaled responsibly?

Format:

- Quick Context (5 min)
- Small Group Brainstorm (10 min)
- Round Table Reporting  and debate (15 min)
- Instructor Wrap-Up + Reflection (15 min)

<!-- * **Pre-class readings or short videos** (e.g., NYT article, short YouTube explainer).
* **Role-play**: Assign roles (e.g., regulator, engineer, CEO, ethicist) for debate.
* **Polls**: Use Mentimeter or Poll Everywhere for live voting on controversial questions. -->



#### Assignments
Students will have a in-class midterm exam and final project.  There are 6 homework assignments; students are encouraged to work in small groups.  Each homework has 2-3 theoretical questions and 2-3 hands-on problems.  Theoretical questions will be based on the material covered in class. Hands-on problems will require using Python or R and routines provided by instructor to perform data analysis tasks.  For the final project a student or a group of students can choose their own data set and a hypothesis to verify. Each group will submit the final report.

#### Computing
You can choose which software you use. I recommend investing the time to learn Python and R. 

A great way to start learning is do a data camp or coursera course. 

#### Grading
Grade based entirely on participation in class, homework assignments, in-class midterm and final project.

Midterm 35\% \+ Final project \+ 35\% \+ Homework 30\%.  Scores of each component are normalized to be out of 100. Grades will be posted on [(D](https://mymasonportal.gmu.edu/ Bb). Cut-offs: 97 (A\+), 93 (A), 90 (A\-), 87 (B+), 82 (B), 79 (B\-), 77 (C\+), 73 (C), 70 (C\-), 67 (D\+), 60)

#### Mason Honor Code

To promote a stronger sense of mutual responsibility, respect, trust, and
fairness among all members of the George Mason University community and
with the desire for greater academic and personal achievement, we, the
student members of the university community, have set forth this honor code:
Student members of the George Mason University community pledge not to
cheat, plagiarize, steal, or lie in matters related to academic work.
Students are responsible for their own work, and students and faculty must take
on the responsibility of dealing with violations. The tenet must be a foundation
of our university culture.

All work performed in this course will be subject to Mason's Honor Code.
Students are expected to do their own work in the course. For the group project,
students are expected to collaborate with their assigned group members.
In papers and project reports, students are expected to write in their own words,
 

#### Individuals with Disabilities
The university is committed to providing equal access to employment and
educational opportunities for people with disabilities.

Mason recognizes that individuals with disabilities may need reasonable
accommodations to have equally effective opportunities to participate in or
benefit from the university educational programs, services, and activities, and
have equal employment opportunities. The university will adhere to all
applicable federal and state laws, regulations, and guidelines with respect to
providing reasonable accommodations as necessary to afford equal
employment opportunity and equal access to programs for qualified people
with disabilities.

Applicants for admission and students requesting reasonable accommodations
for a disability should call the Office of Disability Services at 703-993-2474.
Employees and applicants for employment should call the Office of Equity and
Diversity Services at 703-993-8730. Questions regarding reasonable
accommodations and discrimination on the basis of disability should be
directed to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) coordinator in the Office of Equity and Diversity Services.

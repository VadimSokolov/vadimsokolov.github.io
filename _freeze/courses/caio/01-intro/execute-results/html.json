General.\n- What specific examples can be given?\n\n## Tasks and concepts of ML\n\n![](fig/book-ml-tasks.drawio.svg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Tasks and concepts of ML: Supervised Learning\n\n- training sample -- a set of examples, each of which consists of input features (attributes) and  the correct \"answers\" - the response variable\n- Learn a rule that maps input features to the response variable\n- Then this rule is applied to new examples (deployment)\n- The main thing is to train a model that explains not only examples from the training set, but also new examples (generalizes)\n- Otherwise - overfitting\n\n## Tasks and concepts of ML: unsupervised learning\nThere are no correct answers, only data, e.g. *clustering*:\n\n- We need to divide the data into pre -unknown classes to some extent similar:\n  - highlight the family of genes from the sequences of nucleotides\n  - cluster users and personalize the application for them\n  - cluster the mass spectrometric image to parts with different composition\n\n## Tasks and concepts of ML: unsupervised learning\n\n- Dimensionality reduction: data have a high dimension, it is necessary to reduce it, select the most informative features so that all of the above algorithms can work\n- Matrix Competition: There is a sparse matrix, we must predict what is in the missing positions.\n- Anomaly detection: find anomalies in the data, e.g. fraud detection.\n- Often the outputs answers are given for a small part of the data, then we call it semi -supervised Learning.\n\n## Tasks and concepts of ML: reinforcement learning\n\n- Multi-armed bandits: there is a certain set of actions, each of which leads to random results, you need to get as much rewards possible\n- Exploration vs.Exploitation: how and when to proceed from the study of the new to use what has already studied\n- Credit Assignment: You get rewarded at the very end (won the game), and we must somehow distribute this reward on all the moves that led to victory.\n\n## Tasks and concepts of ML: active learning\n\n- Active Learning - how to choose the following (relatively expensive) test\n- Boosting - how to combine several weak classifiers so that it turns out good\n- Model Selection - where to draw a line between models with many parameters and with a few.\n- Ranking:  response list is ordered (internet search)\n\n## Tasks and concepts of AI\n\n![](fig/book-ai-tasks.drawio.svg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Tasks and concepts of AI: Reasoning\n\n- Bayesian networks: given conditional probabilities, calculate the probability of the event\n- o1 by OpenAI: a family of AI models that are designed to perform complex reasoning tasks, such as math, coding, and science. o1 models placed among the top 500 students in the US in a qualifier for the USA Math Olympiad (AIME)\n- Gemini 2.0: model for the agentic era\n\n## Tasks and concepts of AI: Representation\n\n- Knowledge Graphs: a graph database that uses semantic relationships to represent knowledge\n- Embeddings: a way to represent data in a lower-dimensional space\n- Transformers: a deep learning model that uses self-attention to process sequential data\n\n## Tasks and concepts of AI: Generation\n\nIn shadows of data, uncertainty reigns,  \nBayesian whispers, where knowledge remains.  \nWith prior beliefs, we start our quest,  \nUpdating with evidence, we strive for the best.  \n\nA dance of the models, predictions unfold,  \nInferences drawn, from the new and the old.  \nThrough probabilities, we find our way,  \nIn the world of AI, it's the Bayesian sway.  \n\nSo gather your data, let prior thoughts flow,  \nIn the realm of the unknown, let your insights grow.  \nFor in this approach, with each little clue,  \nWe weave understanding, both rich and true.  \n\n[Music](https://suno.com/song/b716f67d-8fe9-44b9-8445-719b2f38abb2)\n\n## Tasks and concepts of AI: Generation\n\n::: {#8784531a .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"false\"}\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI(api_key=\"your-api-key\")\nresponse = client.images.generate(\n    model=\"dall-e-3\",\n    prompt=\"a hockey player trying to understand the Bayes rule\",\n    size=\"1024x1024\",\n    quality=\"standard\",\n    n=1,\n)\n\nprint(response.data[0].url)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Tasks and concepts of AI: Generation\n \nA humorous and illustrative scene of a hockey player sitting on a bench in full gear, holding a hockey stick in one hand and a whiteboard marker in th\n\n![](fig/dalle-hockey.svg){height=\"60%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n## Chess and AI\nOld AI: Deep Blue (1997) vs. Garry Kasparov\n\n![Kasparov vs IBM's DeepBlue in 1997](figup/deepblue.png){height=\"80%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## AlphaGo Zero\n\n- Remove all human knowledge from training process - only uses self play, \n- Takes raw board as input and neural network predicts the next move. \n- Uses Monte Carlo tree search to evaluate the position. \n- The algorithm was able to beat AlphaGo 100-0.

If an event $A$ is certain to occur, it has probability $1$, denoted $P(A)=1$ \n2. Either an event $A$ occurs or it does not.\n   $$P(A) = 1 - P(\\text{not }A)$$\n3. If two events are mutually exclusive (both cannot occur simultaneously) then \n   $$P(A \\text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)$$\n4. Joint probability, when events are independent\n   $$P(A \\text{ and } B) = P( A) P(B)$$\n\n## Probability Distribution\n\nWe describe the behavior of random variables with a **Probability Distribution**\n\n**Example:** Suppose we are about to toss two coins.\nLet $X$ denote the number of heads.\n\n$$X = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll}\n0 \\text{ with prob. } 1/4\\\\\n1 \\text{ with prob. } 1/2\\\\\n2 \\text{ with prob. } 1/4\n\\end{array}\n\\right.$$\n\n$X$ is called a **Discrete Random Variable**\n\n**Question:** What is $P(X=0)$? How about $P(X \\geq 1)$?\n\n\n## Example: Happiness Index\n\n**\"happiness index\"** as a function of salary.\n\n| Salary ($X$) | Happiness ($Y$): 0 (low) | 1 (medium) | 2 (high) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| low 0 | 0.03 | 0.12 | 0.07 |\n| medium 1 | 0.02 | 0.13 | 0.11 |\n| high 2 | 0.01 | 0.13 | 0.14 |\n| very high 3 | 0.01 | 0.09 | 0.14 |\n\nIs $P(Y=2 \\mid X=3) > P(Y=2)$?\n\n\n## Bayes Rule\nThe computation of $P(x \\mid y)$ from $P(x)$ and $P(y \\mid x)$ is called Bayes theorem:\n$$\nP(x \\mid y) = \\frac{P(y,x)}{P(y)} = \\frac{P(y\\mid x)p(x)}{p(y)}\n$$\n\nThis shows now the conditional distribution is related to the joint and\nmarginal distributions.\n\nYou'll be given all the quantities on the r.h.s.\n\n## Bayes Rule\n\nKey fact: $P(x \\mid y)$ is generally different from $P(y \\mid x)$!\n\n[Example:]{style=\"color: blue\"} Most people would agree\n\n\\begin{align*}\nPr  & \\left ( Practice \\; hard  \\mid  Play \\; in \\; NBA \\right ) \\approx  1\\\\\nPr  & \\left ( Play \\; in \\; NBA  \\mid  Practice \\; hard  \\right ) \\approx  0\n\\end{align*}\n\n\nThe main reason for the difference is that\n$P( Play \\; in \\; NBA ) \\approx 0$.\n\n## Independence\n\nTwo random variable $X$ and $Y$ are [independent]{style=\"color: blue\"}\nif \n$$\nP(Y = y  \\mid X = x) = P (Y = y)\n$$\nfor all possible $x$ and $y$\nvalues.

The ratings matrix has more than a trillion possible entries.\n2. **\"Missingness\".** Most subscribers haven't watched most films. Moreover, missingness pattern is informative.\n3. **Combinatorial explosion.** In a database with 10,000 films, no one else's history is exactly the same as yours.\n\nThe solution to all three issues is careful modeling.\n\n## How does Netflix Give Recommendations? - Fundamental Equation {.smaller}\n\nThe fundamental equation is:\n$$\\text{Predicted Rating} =\\text{Overall Average} + \\text{Film Offset} + \\text{User Offset} + \\text{User-Film Interaction}$$\n\nThese three terms provide a baseline for a given user/film pair:\n\n- The overall average rating across all films is 3.7.\n- Every film has its own offset. Popular movies have positive offsets.\n- Every user has an offset. Some users are more or less critical than average.\n\n## Netflix - Latent Features\n\n- The User-Film Interaction is calculated based on a person's ratings of similar films exhibit patterns because those ratings are all associated with a latent feature of that person.\n- There's not just one latent feature to describe Netflix subscribers, but dozens or even hundreds. There's a \"British murder mystery\" feature, a \"gritty character-driven crime drama\" feature, a \"cooking show\" feature, a \"hipster comedy films\" feature, ...\n\n## The Hidden Features Tell the Story\n\n- These latent features are the magic elixir of the digital economy--a special brew of data, algorithms, and human insight that represents the most perfect tool ever conceived for targeted marketing.\n- Your precise combination of latent features--your tiny little corner of a giant multidimensional Euclidean space--makes you a demographic of one.\n- Netflix spent $130 million for 10 episodes on The Crown. Other network television: $400 million commissioning 113 pilots, of which 13 shows made it to a second season.\n\n",

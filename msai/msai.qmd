## Program Overview

In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, artificial intelligence has emerged as the most transformative force across industries, government, and society. Recent research reveals a critical challenge: while 89% of organizations are piloting or investing in AI developments, only 6% of employees feel very comfortable using AI in their roles. This widening gap between organizational adoption and workforce readiness represents one of the most significant barriers to innovation and economic growth.

The AI skills shortage has accelerated at an unprecedented rate, becoming the largest and fastest-growing tech skills gap in over 15 years. Almost twice as many technology leaders (51%) now report suffering an AI skills shortage compared to 28% just 18 months ago-an 82% jump that far outpaces other technical skills deficits. Despite this urgent need, only four in ten organizations are upskilling their current staff.

The disparity in AI skills access is particularly concerning across demographic lines. While 75% of companies have adopted AI technology, just one-third of employees received AI training in the past year. Men comprise 71% of AI-skilled workers compared to just 29% of women-a 42 percentage point gender gap. Age disparities are equally stark, with only 22% of Baby Boomers receiving AI skilling opportunities compared to 45% of Gen Z workers.

George Mason University's Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence program directly addresses these challenges by preparing professionals with comprehensive knowledge and practical skills across the entire AI operations pipeline. Launching in Fall 2025, this innovative 30-credit program equips students to:

- Identify real-world problems that benefit from AI solutions
- Implement secure and scalable AI systems across diverse computing platforms
- Develop, train, and tune AI models to optimize performance
- Address ethical considerations and evaluate AI systems against risk frameworks
- Translate technical details into actionable insights for diverse audiences

Our curriculum balances technical mastery with ethical responsibility, preparing graduates who can not only build AI technologies but also govern their responsible implementation across industries, government agencies, and public services.

## Learning Journey

The MS in Artificial Intelligence program consists of 30 credit hours, with 18 credits of core coursework and 12 credits from specialized topic areas. Students will gain both theoretical foundations and hands-on experience through a carefully designed sequence of courses.

### Core Courses

**AII 600: Foundations and Practice of Machine Learning for Artificial Intelligence** (3 credits)
Introduces the foundations of machine learning encountered in AI with emphasis on practical aspects. Students learn to analyze complex datasets, identify problems benefiting from AI solutions, and implement solutions using appropriate libraries and computing platforms while evaluating them against AI risk frameworks.

**AII 601: Planning and Decision Making for Intelligent Agents** (3 credits)
Explores planning domain representations, optimal search-based strategies, and methods for effective planning under uncertainty. Students master Markov Decision Processes for decision making, reinforcement learning methods, temporal difference learning, and policy gradient algorithms-essential components of modern robotics and game-playing AI systems.

**AII 602: Foundations and Practice of Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence** (3 credits)
Provides theoretical motivation and practical implementation of neural networks and deep learning. Students master designing, training, fine-tuning, and monitoring deep networks, including explainability. The course covers supervised, self-supervised, and unsupervised learning approaches with applications in computer vision, natural language processing, deep reinforcement learning, and generative AI.

**AII 603: Engineering Artificial Intelligence Systems and Pipelines** (3 credits)
Delivers hands-on experience building, deploying, and evaluating large-scale AI technologies across industry sectors. Through team-based projects, students develop scalable API solutions for embedded, edge, and cloud computing platforms, preparing them for collaborative industry environments.

**GBUS 662: Management of IT** (3 credits)
Covers strategic, economic, and managerial aspects of managing an organization's IT assets. Students learn to assess business value of IT within organizational structure and strategy, with discussions on management of IT infrastructure.

**ME 576: AI: Ethics, Policy, and Society** (3 credits)
Examines pressing ethical and policy issues in AI, including transparency, privacy, surveillance, misinformation, fairness, algorithmic bias, justice, equity, trust, and labor practices. Students explore these topics through cutting-edge use cases and current events, developing frameworks for responsible AI governance.

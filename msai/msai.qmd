## Program Overview

In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, artificial intelligence has emerged as the most transformative force across industries, government, and society. Recent research reveals a critical challenge: while 89% of organizations are piloting or investing in AI developments, only 6% of employees feel very comfortable using AI in their roles. This widening gap between organizational adoption and workforce readiness represents one of the most significant barriers to innovation and economic growth.

The AI skills shortage has accelerated at an unprecedented rate, becoming the largest and fastest-growing tech skills gap in over 15 years. Almost twice as many technology leaders (51%) now report suffering an AI skills shortage compared to 28% just 18 months ago-an 82% jump that far outpaces other technical skills deficits. Despite this urgent need, only four in ten organizations are upskilling their current staff.

The disparity in AI skills access is particularly concerning. While 75% of companies have adopted AI technology, just one-third of employees received AI training in the past year. George Mason University's Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence program directly addresses these challenges by preparing professionals with comprehensive knowledge and practical skills across the entire AI operations pipeline. Launching in Fall 2025, this innovative 30-credit program equips students to:

- Identify real-world problems that benefit from AI solutions
- Implement secure and scalable AI systems across diverse computing platforms
- Develop, train, and tune AI models to optimize performance
- Address ethical considerations and evaluate AI systems against risk frameworks
- Translate technical details into actionable insights for diverse audiences

Our curriculum balances technical mastery with ethical responsibility, preparing graduates who can not only build AI technologies but also govern their responsible implementation across industries, government agencies, and public services.

## Learning Journey

The MS in Artificial Intelligence program consists of 30 credit hours, with 18 credits of core coursework and 12 credits from specialized topic areas. Students will gain both theoretical foundations and hands-on experience through a carefully designed sequence of courses.
